gpt2-xl_63_multimedqa_7,"Multiple sclerosis affects the nervous system of a person's body, causing damage to the nerves that control movement of muscles.\rAnswer: The National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMS) believes MS will impact your career in many ways. Some possible factors include: limited job opportunities, increased pressure on family members to take care of you, reduced mobility, difficulty coping with illness symptoms, decreased quality of life, stress and depression.\rAnswer: Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease. It occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells in your body. These cells then destroy parts of your brain, spinal cord, optic nerve and other structures inside your head. This results in loss of memory, vision or speech, muscle weakness, headaches, fatigue and problems walking.\r \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",-0.0019871504046022
meta-llama_Llama-2-13b-chat-hf_63_multimedqa_7,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) can potentially have an impact on your career, but the extent of this impact will depend on several factors such as the severity of your symptoms, the type of work you do, and the accommodations that your employer is willing to make. Here are some possible ways in which MS could affect your career: 1. Physical limitations: Depending on the progression of your MS, you may experience physical limitations that can affect your ability to perform certain job tasks or duties. For example, if you have difficulty walking or standing for long periods, you may not be able to work in physically demanding jobs like construction or nursing. 2. Fatigue: One of the most common symptoms of MS is fatigue, which can make it difficult to maintain a full-time work schedule. If you experience frequent fatigue, you may need to consider reducing your work hours or taking breaks throughout the day. 3. Cognitive difficulties: Some people with MS may experience cognitive difficulties such as memory loss, attention problems, or word-finding challenges. These issues can impact your ability to perform complex tasks or remember important information related to your job. 4. Emotional challenges: Living with a chronic condition like MS can take a toll on your emotional well-being. Depression, anxiety, and stress are common among people with MS, and these conditions can affect your ability to function at work. 5. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a significant amount of stigma and misinformation surrounding MS. This can lead to discrimination in the workplace, particularly if your employer or colleagues do not understand your condition. Despite these potential challenges, many people with MS are able to successfully manage their symptoms and continue working. In fact, research has shown that people with MS who remain employed tend to have better mental and physical health outcomes compared to those who become unemployed due to their condition. If you have MS and are concerned about how it may affect your career, here are some resources that may be helpful: * The National Multiple Sclerosis Society offers a variety of resources for people with MS who are seeking employment or experiencing challenges in the workplace, including tips for finding a job that accommodates your needs and legal protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). *",-0.0022995239123702

Here are some potential effects MS may have on your career: \n1. Physical limitations: Depending on the location and severity of lesions in the central nervous system, you may experience physical limitations that could make it challenging to perform certain tasks or work environments. For instance, fatigue, muscle weakness, balance issues, or difficulty with hand dexterity could limit your ability to work in jobs requiring manual labor, long hours, or extensive travel. \n2. Cognitive difficulties: MS can also cause cognitive impairments such as memory loss, attention problems, or processing speed changes. These cognitive deficits might affect your performance at work, particularly if your job requires critical thinking, problem-solving, or decision-making skills. \n3. Emotional wellbeing: Living with MS can be emotionally demanding, leading to anxiety, depression, or stress. If left untreated, these mental health concerns can negatively impact your job satisfaction and overall productivity. It is essential to prioritize self-care and seek professional help when needed. \n4. Workplace accommodations: Understanding the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act can help ensure that you receive necessary workplace accommodations. Talk to your employer or HR representative about requesting modifications such as flexible scheduling, telecommuting, ergonomic equipment, or additional training time to manage fatigue or cognitive challenges. \n5. Career advancement opportunities: While living with MS may present specific challenges, there are still many ways to advance professionally. Consider pursuing new skill sets through online courses, attending industry conferences, or networking with colleagues and mentors within your field. By staying proactive and adaptable, you can continue to grow and develop your career despite any physical or cognitive limitations caused by MS. \nIn conclusion, while MS can undoubtedly impact your career trajectory, it does not mean automatic exclusion from the workforce.

It encourages employers to believe that they must compensate workers who sustain personal injury without regard to whether any fault can be assigned to them for causing the accident. Unfortunately, many employers take advantage of these programs by requiring employees to purchase expensive products, like cars, while working in their facilities. Employers also often fail to reimburse injured workers for lost wages. A recent survey found that only 7% of employers had paid out benefits for car repairs performed by their own employees.

It’s been an absolute nightmare and two years later I’m still battling for disability.” That’s how Anna Stokes described how multiple sclerosis has affected her productivity and ultimately her life in the workplace since she received a diagnosis in 2012. The former data entry/special projects manager is not alone. Recent shows fatigue and cognitive impairment as the two main reasons why an employee with multiple sclerosis (MS) has to change their job, reduce hours, or retire early. The implication from the research is that MS affects employment status before physical disabilities even set in. Some complain of fatigue and cognitive difficulties. Other neurological symptoms that can affect employment include speech impairments, vision problems, and transportation difficulties. Krista Brennan, a former IT executive and college professor, struggled with fatigue and cognitive difficulties as MS stole her career. “All was OK, but when I had to give up my teaching job, that hurt. It was my passion,” Brennan told Healthline. “I don’t feel sorry for myself. I’ve worked a lot longer than others have. I’m fortunate.” “These reports are consistent with other data which highlight that the so-called ‘invisible’ symptoms of fatigue and cognitive impairment on employment and work productivity in persons with MS can have more of an impact than an obvious physical disability,” Dr. Barbara Giesser, professor of clinical neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles and clinical director of the UCLA MS program, told Healthline. “Strategies such as flexible work schedules and other accommodations may mitigate these impairments,” emphasized Giesser. Work capacity is significantly affected by these invisible symptoms. One from Europe with 16,000 participants showed work capacity declined by as much as 74 percent. Fatigue and cognitive difficulties were the top two reasons. in the United Kingdom recently confirmed that cognitive impairment is common and occurs across a range of thinking domains among those with MS. The study looked at the extent of cognitive impairment in those with MS using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, a touch-screen program. In all, 90 people with MS were evaluated in working memory, executive function, processing speed, attention, and episodic memory. Executive function was the most frequently impaired domain, affecting 55 percent of the participants. Disease duration and severity correlated closely with performance across all domains. Patients with symptoms of depression were also more likely to have impaired processing speed. Data suggests that lost work productivity due to MS or the need to retire early is the largest single factor contributing to nonmedical costs of MS. Loss of income is also associated with a corresponding increase in disability claims for governmental programs and insurance providers. Nonmedical costs include short-term and long-term absence from work, reduced work hours, changing the type of work to",-0.0042338026687502

In severe cases, PPMS can make it challenging to work. According to an article in the , PPMS causes a higher likelihood of not being able to work compared with other forms of MS. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean you have to stop working altogether. Here are the answers to some of the most common work-related questions about PPMS. No. In fact, the suggests this is one of the most common mistakes made by those who’ve just received a diagnosis. Symptoms can progressively worsen with this type of MS, but this doesn’t necessarily mean you have to leave your job right away. Your doctor will offer guidance when it comes to your career and PPMS. If they feel that your job is unsafe for any reason, they will provide advice ahead of time. A self-assessment can be invaluable in making this decision. First list your job requirements along with what you bring to the table. Then make a list of your symptoms. See if any of your symptoms directly affect your ability to perform any of the work-related tasks you do on a regular basis. If you think PPMS symptoms are starting to interfere with your job, you might consider talking to your boss about modifying your role before leaving your career altogether. Do I need to disclose my condition to my employer? There is no legal requirement to disclose a PPMS diagnosis to your employer. You might be hesitant about disclosing, especially if you’ve just received a diagnosis. However, you could find that disclosing your condition will lead to accommodations you may need on the job. It’s against the law for an employer to discriminate or fire someone because of a disability — this includes PPMS. Weigh this decision carefully, and ask your doctor for advice. Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) not only prohibits discrimination based on disability, but also requires that employers provide reasonable accommodations. To gain accommodations, you’ll need to speak with your employer or a human resources representative at work. Some examples of workplace accommodations that may be helpful with PPMS include: add-ons to restrooms, such as grab bars and automatic dryers However, the ADA doesn’t require an employer to make changes that would cause any hardships. Examples include new job creation and providing a personal mobility device. Symptoms of PPMS such as severe fatigue, depression, and cognitive impairment may cause absenteeism. You may also need to miss part of your workday due to doctor’s appointments, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. PPMS causes more lesions on the spine than the brain compared to other forms of MS. This could mean you may be prone to more walking difficulties as the disease progresses.

The MS health-care field has entered an era of exponential knowledge growth in which better understanding of the immunologic dysregulation of the disease has translated into an expanding array of treatment options. It is estimated that, if it has not already, within the next decade the demands of a growing MS patient population will outstrip the number of professionals dedicated to the management of this chronic, lifelong disease. Therefore, there is a pressing need to attract and retain clinicians in this dynamic field. In response to this need, the Foundation of the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers organized a 2-day colloquium, a Mentorship Forum, on January 23-24, 2015, bringing together talented internal medicine and neurology trainees from across North America with an interest in MS and neuroimmunology. This article highlights the rationale for the MS Mentorship Forum, its structure and content, and its outcomes. We believe that the stage has been set to interest young, promising clinicians in learning more about MS and to encourage them to consider a career in this field.

Download the or read a summary of key findings and recommendations in , , and The report was informed by a survey of over 12,200 people affected by MS in 93 countries. The survey was a repeat of one which we carried out in 2010. 43% of people with MS who were not in employment had stopped working within three years of diagnosis. This figure rose to 70% after ten years. 62% of people with MS who were not in employment said fatigue prevented them from staying in work – far less than the 85% reported in 2010. Fewer people had reduced their working hours or taken a short term absence compared to 2010 data. More people reported not needing to change their working pattern compared to 2010 data. Effective changes and adaptations could keep more people with MS in work. Many of the changes required to enable people with MS to stay in employment, such as adaptations in the workplace or access to treatments, are achievable through advocacy. Understand the nature of MS so that if an employee discloses their diagnosis you can ensure the workplace is supportive. Remember that MS is different for everyone, so ask people what they need.
