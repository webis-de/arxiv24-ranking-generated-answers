chatgpt_102_multimedqa_1,"Randomly getting eczema can happen to anyone, even if they have never had it before. Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic skin condition characterized by dry, itchy, and inflamed skin. While the exact cause of eczema is unknown, it is believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Certain triggers can lead to the development of eczema, even in individuals who have never experienced it before. These triggers may include irritants (such as soaps, detergents, and certain fabrics), allergens (such as pollen, pet dander, and dust mites), temperature changes, stress, and hormonal changes. If you have randomly developed eczema, it is recommended to visit a healthcare professional, such as a dermatologist, for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. They can help determine the cause of your eczema and provide suitable management options, which may include moisturizing creams, topical corticosteroids, antihistamines, or other medications. Additionally, lifestyle changes like avoiding triggers, using gentle skincare products, and maintaining good skin hygiene can help manage and prevent flare-ups. It's important to note that eczema is a chronic condition that can come and go throughout a person's life. While there is no cure for eczema, with proper management and care, symptoms can be minimized, and flare-ups can be controlled.",-0.0068096001632511
meta-llama_Llama-2-7b-chat-hf_102_multimedqa_8,"Eczema is a chronic skin condition characterized by dry, itchy, scaly patches on the skin. It can occur suddenly or develop over time, often without any known cause. While there is no cure for eczema, there are several treatments and lifestyle changes that can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Here are some possible causes of suddenly developed eczema:\n1. Allergies: Exposure to certain allergens like pollen, dust mites, or pet dander can trigger an allergic reaction in people with eczema. Common allergy triggers include foods (like dairy, nuts, or gluten), plants (like poison ivy or oak), and insect stings. If you have recently come into contact with something new or increased your exposure to a known allergen, this could be contributing to your sudden eczema flare-up. \n2. Skin irritants: Certain substances can directly irritate the skin, leading to inflammation and eczema symptoms. These may include harsh soaps, cleansers, or chemicals in personal care products, as well as environmental factors like pollution or smoke. Avoid using anything that may aggravate the skin until the eczema has improved. \n3. Stress and emotional changes: Emotional stress can exacerbate existing eczema symptoms or even trigger new flare-ups. This may be due to the body's natural response to stress hormones, which can affect the immune system and skin barrier function. Practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga, can help reduce stress levels and alleviate eczema symptoms. \n4. Hormonal fluctuations: Changes in hormone levels - including those experienced during pregnancy, menstruation, or menopause - can lead to shifts in the immune system and skin barrier function, resulting in eczema flare-ups. Keep track of your hormone levels and consult with your doctor if you suspect a connection between your hormonal changes and your eczema. \n5. Infections: Bacterial, viral, or fungal infections can trigger or worsen eczema symptoms. Contact dermatitis,",-0.023117670789361
meta-llama_Llama-2-13b-chat-hf_102_multimedqa_7,"Eczema is a general term for many types of skin conditions that cause dry, itchy, inflamed, and sometimes infected skin. It can be caused by various factors such as genetics, allergies, environmental triggers like pollen or soaps, and underlying conditions like atopic dermatitis (a chronic form of eczema). Randomly getting eczema without any identifiable trigger may indicate an episodic case of contact dermatitis or atopic dermatitis. \nHere's what you should know:\n1) Identify your symptoms: Take note if the rash appears on specific areas of your body (e.g., hands, face, legs), how long it lasts, and whether it's accompanied by redness, swelling, oozing, or crusting. These details will help determine the appropriate treatment plan. \n2) Check for potential triggers: Make a list of products you recently used on your skin, including cosmetics, detergents, cleaning agents, and medications. Also, consider exposure to pets, pollen, dust mites, mold, or other possible irritants. If you suspect a particular item might be causing the issue, stop using it and see if your symptoms improve. \n3) Keep your skin moisturized: Use gentle, fragrance-free creams or lotions to lock in hydration and prevent dryness. Apply them frequently throughout the day, especially after bathing or showering. Avoid harsh soaps and cleansers; instead opt for ones designed for sensitive skin. \n4) Explore over-the-counter treatments: Depending on the severity of your condition, OTC corticosteroid creams or antihistamines may provide relief. Topical antibiotics could also be prescribed if there are signs of infection. Always follow the instructions provided with these medications, and consult your doctor before starting any new regimen. \n5) Consult a professional: If your symptoms persist, worsen, or fail to respond to self-care measures, seek guidance from a healthcare provider. They can offer personalized advice based on your unique situation and recommend specialized treatments when necessary. \nRemember, while eczema cannot be cured, managing symptoms effectively through proper skincare hab",-0.0231387540698051

gpt2-large_102_multimedqa_4,"Eczema is caused by the allergic reaction of skin cells that is triggered by bacteria or viruses. It's very common on children who eat foods containing food-borne pathogens such as eggs or nuts. If you get eczema from eating raw fruits or vegetables then it could be a sign of an allergy. Symptoms of an allergy include hives, swelling, redness, pain, red eyes, runny nose, swollen lymph nodes, wheezing, difficulty breathing, coughing up blood, vomiting, diarrhea, and sometimes even death. In addition, some people with eczema may experience anaphylactic shock when they inhale pollen in the air. The best thing to do if you suspect your child has eczema is to take him or her to the doctor right away. You can also use this information to guide you through the proper treatment for your child. In general, the more severe symptoms you have, the less likely your child will be exposed to food-borne pathogens. When it comes to allergies, however, there is no one correct way to diagnose them. As adults we develop tolerance and sensitivity to certain allergens. This means that our bodies become less sensitive to specific allergens than at any other time in our lives; therefore, some of us have a greater potential risk of getting these kinds of allergies than others. Therefore, although it is important to know the type of reactions your child may be experiencing to avoid exposing yourself, it is not always necessary. For example, some people may react more strongly to foods because they were born with a predisposition to intolerance to particular proteins in food. Sometimes when someone gets sick, he or she becomes hypersensitive to another substance in his or her bodyâ€”such as something in the water in which he or she was swimming. Because this can occur suddenly and without warning, someone who has been hospitalized can't tell you how much hypersensitivity might be happening to him or her. While most people with hypersensitivity to chemicals or foreign substances have no symptoms, some cases can result in a life-threatening event. In those cases, doctors must determine whether the person should receive emergency care. In order to prevent this, keep things like swimming pools clean and change out of rags or swimsuits after you go swimming. If you think your child has eczema, ask your pediatrician questions about the triggers that are causing the symptoms. Ask about your child's activities over the past few weeks, including the food he or she eats, what medications he or she",-0.8931287527084351

Complete Answer: In many people who contract strep throat, there is only mild soreness in the upper part of their throats at first, but then develops into severe pain in the chest area. This type of strep throat symptom is called ""strep throat cough"" and can last several days or even up to three months. If left untreated, a chronic infection could develop within two to four years.\nQuestion: What's the difference between herpes zoster (shingles) and chickenpox (varicella)? Complete Answer: Both forms of varicella, like shingles, are viral infections caused by the same virus, varicella. While both forms of shingles can occur on its own or during an outbreak of chickenpox, shingles is more likely to lead to serious complications such as pneumonia. When chickenpox is triggered, it produces similar symptoms including high fevers, headache, muscle aches, itching of the eyes and mouth, swollen glands, swollen lymph nodes, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.\nQuestion: What is the name of the disease that causes appendicitis? Complete Answer: A complication of appendicitis is septicemia, which means infection of the blood vessels in the abdomen (intestinal tract). The bloodstream becomes inflamed, which makes it difficult for waste products produced in the liver to exit. Sepsis can result in shock, organ failure and death. \NQuestion: Why is having a cold so annoying? Complete Answer: Cold weather is a great excuse for staying indoors until the temperature drops below freezing. But when the temperature suddenly rises, heat doesn't escape fast enough inside the house.
