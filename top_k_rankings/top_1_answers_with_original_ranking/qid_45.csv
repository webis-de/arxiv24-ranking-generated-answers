meta-llama_Llama-2-13b-chat-hf_45_multimedqa_7,"No, diabetes cannot be cured in the classical sense. However, it can be managed and controlled through lifestyle changes and medication. Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how your body regulates blood sugar levels. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin, resulting in a complete deficiency of this hormone. Type 2 diabetes develops gradually over time as the body becomes less responsive to insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels. Both types require ongoing management to prevent complications such as nerve damage, kidney damage, and vision loss. While there is no known cure for diabetes, managing the condition effectively can significantly improve quality of life and longevity. Effective management involves a combination of lifestyle modifications, such as following a healthy diet and regular exercise, taking prescribed medications, monitoring blood glucose levels regularly, and receiving routine check-ups with a healthcare provider. It's important to note that some people may experience long periods of remission from symptoms after being diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes; however, the disease itself cannot be fully eliminated.""",-0.0034996948670595

Everyone wants a cure for diabetes. Or do they? Some people think so much money is made from that nobody in power really wants to “cure” it. Is there any truth to this? Could there be a cure? I’m not sure it’s possible to find a cure for something without knowing what causes it or how it works. At least in the case of Type 1, we have a general idea. The immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells and destroys them. For this reason, Type 1 is called an “autoimmune” disease, although nobody seems to know exactly . We don’t know why beta cells come under attack, but environmental exposure to something — a food, a virus, a chemical — seems to set the process off. According to (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation), to cure Type 1, we would have to turn off the immune system attack, or somehow protect beta cells from the immune system. Then we would need to find a way to restore new, functioning beta cells. These cells could perhaps be grown from other remaining healthy cells in the pancreas, or they could be manufactured in a lab or obtained from another animal and put into the body. If this all sounds extremely difficult, it is. Until now, no autoimmune disease has been cured. But perhaps it is possible. University of Colorado researchers say they have . They created a peptide that stops the immune system’s T-cells from attacking the beta cells. One researcher, Dr. David Wagner, said the effect could be huge, if it works in humans. The drug is effective at both preventing the mice from developing diabetes as well as reversing the effects of diabetes in mice that already have the condition. These effects “last for as long as we administer the drug,” Wagner noted. JDRF is certainly looking for a Type 1 cure. They fund research on protecting the pancreas and also research on Type 1 prevention, which they call “the most cost-effective cure.” They have a sophisticated fundraising program. Unfortunately, Type 2 is more complicated and less well understood. As with Type 1, the causes are probably genetic and environmental, but we don’t know exactly what they are. The process of Type 2 is also poorly understood. There can be problems in the pancreas, the liver, or the intestines. Besides insulin defects, there may also be problems with , which tells the liver to pump glucose into the blood. Glucagon problems one of the issues the drug is supposed to control, but it doesn’t always work. Other hormones including amylin, ghrelin, leptin, and incretins and can go wrong. Glands that are supposed to tell the pancreas to produce insulin may not be working. Muscle cells may stop producing proteins needed for insulin to get glucose into cells. With",-0.005401540081948

chatgpt_45_multimedqa_5,"At present, there is no known cure for diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by high levels of blood glucose (sugar) due to the body's inability to properly regulate insulin, a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels. However, with proper management and lifestyle changes, it is possible to effectively control diabetes and lead a healthy life. Type 1 diabetes, which is an autoimmune disease, cannot be cured as it involves the destruction of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. People with type 1 diabetes require insulin therapy to survive. Type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, is primarily linked to lifestyle factors and can often be managed or even reversed through a combination of healthy eating, regular physical activity, weight management, and, in some cases, medications or insulin therapy. By adopting a balanced diet, increasing physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and closely monitoring blood sugar levels, many individuals with type 2 diabetes are able to achieve good control of their condition.

Your physician will also provide an overall evaluation and advice. Question: I'm in my 60s, but still overweight. Is there anything I should do to keep myself healthier? Complete Answer: Unfortunately, no. The most effective treatment for weight loss is losing weight. There's nothing you can do about whether you're still fat or not, only about the amount of weight you lose. For example, if you were 10 pounds heavier and eating 3 pounds less each day, you'd be looking at around a 5% reduction in your waist size - that means that you could still drop five pounds without sacrificing much of your height, because you're actually losing 1/3 of your body mass. You can also achieve a smaller waistline by having sex less often - your metabolism slows down when you're sexually active. And by cutting out all fatty foods (fish, red meat, dairy products) from your diet, you'll feel fuller longer and lose a lot more weight. This is why even people who are currently normal weight have had very positive results following lifestyle changes like quitting smoking, eating better, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and so forth. In fact, in some countries people who quit smoking and followed their recommendations for several years ended up being fatter than they started!

08c707de-23a6-4354-ad9c-a8a1f817b4a1,"Type 2 diabetes, the most common type of this disease, has no known cure. There are specific risk factors for the disease, including genetics, race, age and obesity, although the specific cause remains unknown. The disease, characterized by the body’s inability to effectively utilize insulin, is treatable and preventable by maintaining the right weight for your height, eating a heart-healthy diet and participating in a steady regimen of physical activity. Research into cures for the disease is ongoing, funded by several organizations including the American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. Massachusetts General Hospital is known for having the largest research department of any academic hospital. Led by several top researchers, the department has spent 30 years looking into programs to prevent and to cure the especially complex type 2 diabetes. Although the general concensus among its researchers is that a cure for the disease does not seem likely in the short-term, research continues. Since the insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes eventually destroys the beta cells in the pancreas responsible for insulin production, current research centers around the regeneration and new growth of beta cells. Recent discoveries include a co-activator of Bridge 1, also known as the insulin gene, and new functions of the Hedgehog protein. These discoveries are central to the design of new drug therapies intended to boost insulin production, and in restoring beta cell function in people with diabetes. Dr. Marc Hammerman is leading the research in curing type 2 diabetes at Washington University in St. Louis. Hammerman and his co-researcher, Sharon Rogers, are known experts in the field of organogenesis, a science that focuses on growing new organs from stem cells and embryonic cell clusters. Their research was successful in curing a disease that closely resembles type 2 diabetes in lab rats by transplanting primordial cells that grew into insulin-producing cells without setting off attacks by the animals’ immune systems. One of the keys to the success of their research was using pig pancreatic primordia. They found that when harvested early in the pigs’ development stages, the cells became invisible to the rats’ immune systems. This research continues to show promise, although human trials have not yet been undertaken. Focusing on the problems caused by obesity in many type 2 diabetics, UK researchers Dr. Carel la Roux and Dr. Richard Welbourn used bariatric surgery as the basis for their research into a cure for type 2 diabetes. They performed gastric bypass surgery on 34 type 2 diabetics. Within two years, most patients saw weight loss of up to one-third of their body weight, and 72 percent of the patients saw their diabetes go into full remission. Follow-up research concluded that insulin resistance in the patients had decreased and insulin production overall had increased. It is well-known that there are clear links between obesity and type 2 diabetes, but La Roux’s research showed that obesity alone is not the cause. During the study, most patients’ diabetes began to go into remission well before significant weight loss was seen.

Seriously, what are all of us with diabetes actually complaining about? Today we’re sharing our Top 10 faves: Our furry little friends seem to be getting cured every week. For instance, take this recent example from the University of Toledo where — oh boy! Those very same researchers acknowledge that “there are more than 125 different therapies that cure type 1 diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice… Clinical trials were developed because of that model, but none have worked in humans.” Right. OK, so a substance called FAHFA (fatty acid hydroxyl acid) helps cells secrete insulin. But really, ? Did you have to put the ‘C word’ in the headline? And what’s with the fat mouse photo? Yup, this is one of with CURE in ALL CAPS. This one states that “a probiotic pill… could spell the end for diabetes agony.” Thank you, British tabloid. The pill, btw, is Lactobacillus, something used to prevent and treat diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Now wouldn’t that be a novel source of the CURE? This one’s an especially big tease: All you need is to restore blood sugar levels to a healthy range for two days. How exactly is that a cure? The article says, “scientists believe this could lead to a new generation of safer, more effective diabetes drugs.” Which of course is not a cure at all, but just more drugs… We hear this all over the place – just eat a raw food diet, and lose the diabetes. But this guy Gabriel Cousins had the audacity to write a book about it, with the title “” Eyes. Rolling. Back. In. Head. The description says, “this book introduces and proposes a raw food diet to control diabetes.” And since when is “control” equivalent to “cure”? We know you want to sell books, but seriously, pull your head out, Cousins. It’s that everything nice spice that of course would have eliminated diabetes by now if it could have. But some continue to And of course, cinnamon must cure diabetes. After, all . Seriously, People.

ffa5a018-effd-4478-9320-63bbd0a43e4d,"Just a Little Weight Loss Can Put Diabetes Into Remission FRIDAY, Oct. 4, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- British researchers have good news for people with type 2 diabetes -- you don't need to lose a ton of weight to make a difference in your health. In fact, they found that losing just 10% of your body weight during the first five years you have the disease can lead to remission of type 2 diabetes. That weight loss would be 18 pounds for someone who weighs 180 pounds. It doesn't matter what diet helps you lose the weight. And it doesn't matter how slow or how quickly those pounds come off, the investigators found. ""Even small amounts of weight loss can help you achieve remission. Extreme dieting and exercising are not necessary,"" said study author Dr. Hajira Dambha-Miller, a general practice physician and clinical lecturer at the University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, in the United Kingdom. ""Type 2 diabetes should no longer be seen as a lifelong disease,"" she added. The disease can essentially be cured if you lose weight and keep it off, according to Dambha-Miller. The researchers said that type 2 diabetes affects 400 million people around the world. It's typically considered a chronic, progressive disease. But significant weight loss through extreme dieting (less than 700 calories a day) can bring about remission in almost 90% of people with type 2 diabetes, the study authors noted. Weight-loss surgery also tends to bring on remission. Intensive exercise coupled with a modest weight loss of 7% or less of body weight brought on remission in almost 12% of people in one study, according to the new report. But maybe bringing on remission didn't need to be so hard, the researchers surmised. ""The existing evidence for achieving remission suggests extreme levels of exercise and rather restrictive diets. This is simply not realistic or achievable for my patients, especially in the longer term,"" Dambha-Miller said. ""It is also demotivating for my patients when they are unable to achieve large amounts of weight loss. Accordingly, we decided to look at modest weight loss over a longer period in a real-world population without any crazy diet or exercise requirements,"" she explained. For the new study, the researchers followed the health of almost 900 people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for five years. The study participants, aged 40 to 69, provided information on weight, activity levels, diet and alcohol consumption. Thirty percent of the group had achieved type 2 diabetes remission at the five-year follow-up. Those who had achieved a 10% weight loss were 77% more likely to be in remission after five years, the findings showed. There was no specific intervention in the study. ""This means there were no mandatory exercise or dietary requirements. All our participants did different things and still managed to lose weight and beat diabetes into remission,"" Dambha-Miller said. She said that experts don't know exactly how losing weight helps, but they hypothesize that as people lose weight, the beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin start to work",-0.0127195753157138

The Intersection of Diabetes Research and Politics The Intersection of Diabetes Research and Politics I was diagnosed with diabetes when I was 15. I always figured that by now, it would have effectively been cured — not necessarily meaning science would have found a way to reverse the condition and restore the body to complete self-sufficiency, but I assumed that by now management would mean something along the lines of a once-a-month shot that would then be self-regulating. I know that might sound naive, but that assumption was based at least in part on the research I was reading then. It seems to me that in mice was basically cured in 1998! Study after study showed unbelievably promising results or flat-out cures that never seemed to actually lead to real-life results for those of us living with diabetes. And yet, here we are. The closest we have to a cure are pump/CGM combinations that are starting to run artificial pancreas algorithms. And that’s a big step, but far short of perfect. I am one of those lucky folks who seem to have a lot of trouble with a pump — when I tried one, absorption proved terribly inconsistent, infusion sites started to hurt more and more, and my skin reacted to the adhesive IV dressings I would have to put over the cannula sites since the adhesive on the actual cannula often failed to hold for a full two days. I went back onto multiple daily injections and haven’t looked back. I continue to read promising studies using nanotechnology, genetically engineered implantable insulin producing cells, and so on, but as before, it all seems to be forever trapped in that stage of “promising new research” that can’t seem to make that leap into the category that might actually be useful for US. It’s a frustrating cycle to be caught up in. And in the midst of it all, I have some real concerns for the future of diabetes research as the political winds seem to be shifting. Massive cuts are coming in whatever budget this Congress passes. They may not be as drastic as the initial offering, but there will be cuts. And diabetes funding will almost certainly be among them. Research will still be funded, and I don’t think all government funding will dry up, but it’s going to shrink. And that puts us in a tenuous situation. You see, when the funding has to shift to private companies, it can do two things, neither of which are good. First, it can very easily lead to higher prices for drugs — and insulin is ALREADY skyrocketing. With a combination of deregulation AND less public funding, those prices could become truly outrageous. Second, when the funding is private, the outcomes need to generate the revenue to make up for",-0.0148483132943511
