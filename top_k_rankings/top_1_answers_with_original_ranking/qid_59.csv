chatgpt_59_multimedqa_10,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. The long-term effects of MS can vary widely from person to person. While it is difficult to predict the specific long-term effects someone with MS may experience, there are several potential outcomes. Some individuals with MS may have a relatively mild course with few long-term effects, experiencing only occasional relapses or flare-ups. Others may experience more severe and progressive symptoms that lead to significant disability over time. The likelihood of developing long-term effects depends on various factors, including the type of MS, the severity of the disease, and the individual's response to treatment. Common long-term effects of MS can include fatigue, muscle weakness, difficulty walking, balance problems, numbness or tingling, cognitive impairment, bladder and bowel dysfunction, and changes in mood or emotional well-being. However, it is important to note that not everyone with MS will develop all of these symptoms, and the progression and severity of symptoms can vary greatly. Managing MS and minimizing the impact of long-term effects typically involves a combination of medication, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and lifestyle modifications. Regular medical follow-ups and adherence to treatment plans are crucial in managing the condition effectively. It is worth mentioning that ongoing research is being conducted to better understand MS and develop more effective treatments. It is essential for individuals with MS to work closely with their healthcare team to monitor their condition and explore all available options for managing symptoms and preventing long-term effects.",-0.0029195800889283

While there is no cure for MS, understanding its long-term effects can help individuals with the condition make informed decisions about their treatment options. Here's an overview of the potential long-term effects of MS and their likelihood:\nLikelihood: High\n1. Disability progression: MS can lead to progressive disability over time if left untreated or inadequately managed. The rate at which disability progresses varies widely between individuals, but studies suggest that up to 70% of people with MS will experience significant disability within two decades after diagnosis. The likelihood of disability progression increases with age, especially beyond age 50. If you have been recently diagnosed with MS, it is essential to work closely with your healthcare provider to manage symptoms aggressively and slow down the progression of the disease. Early detection and appropriate intervention can significantly reduce the risk of long-term disability. \n2. Cognitive impairment: MS can also cause cognitive problems such as memory loss, difficulty paying attention, decision-making challenges, and word retrieval issues. These cognitive changes may be related to damage to specific areas of the brain affected by MS. Studies estimate that around half of all patients with MS experience some form of cognitive dysfunction, with more pronounced difficulties found in those with a longer duration of illness or greater disease activity. It is crucial to address these concerns early on through rehabilitation programs tailored to individual needs or medications specifically designed to improve cognition. \n3. Emotional distress: Living with MS can take an emotional toll on individuals and their loved ones due to factors like uncertainty surrounding the course of the disease, physical limitations, social isolation, financial strain caused by managing symptoms & treatments, fear of future exacerbations/relapses plus depression resulting from feeling powerless against one's illness. Mental health professionals recommend seeking support services whenever needed - whether counselor visits become regular appointments during flare-ups or simply talking regularly via phone calls/text messages throughout treatment plans adjustments.

The long-term effects of MS can vary widely depending on several factors such as age at onset, disease course, severity, treatment options, lifestyle changes, and other comorbidities. Here are some possible long-term effects of MS: 1. Physical Disability: One of the most significant long-term effects of MS is physical disability. As the disease progresses, it can lead to weakness, spasticity, loss of balance, and difficulty with mobility. Depending on the lesion location and progression, patients may experience cognitive impairment, vision problems, or speech difficulties. 2. Fatigue: MS fatigue is characterized by persistent tiredness, weakness, and lack of energy, which can interfere with daily activities. It's estimated that up to 80% of people living with MS experience chronic fatigue, making it one of the most common long-term symptoms. 3. Cognitive Changes: Some individuals with MS may experience long-term cognitive changes, including memory loss, difficulty concentrating, and processing speed issues. These cognitive changes can impact employment, social relationships, and overall quality of life. 4. Emotional Distress: Living with MS can take a significant emotional toll, leading to anxiety, depression, and stress. Patients may experience fear of relapse, uncertainty about their future, and frustration due to limitations in everyday activities. 5. Bladder and Bowel Dysfunction: Long-term damage to the nerves controlling bladder and bowel functions is not uncommon in MS patients. This can result in urinary frequency, urgency, constipation, or fecal incontinence, significantly impacting quality of life. 6. Sexual Dysfunction: MS can cause sexual dysfunction in both men and women, including decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and vaginal dryness. These issues can be challenging to discuss but should be addressed to maintain a fulfilling personal life. 7.

The cause of this abnormal immune response remains unknown. It has been speculated that there may be some connection between various autoimmune diseases and this syndrome.\u2026 Although many patients experience improvement over time with appropriate treatment, no controlled clinical trials have shown that any specific cure exists for MS. More research on this condition will help us better understand its causes. In addition, it is estimated that up to 75% of people who start treatment with a vaccine for MS develop relapses of their original disease within two years of starting the course of therapy.\u201cMultiple Sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating, degenerative disorder. Although there are currently no known cures or treatments, there are effective interventions available for managing symptoms as well as delaying progression of the illness. Multiple sclerosis affects about 1.2 million Americans, and about 10 percent die from the disease each year. A vaccine for MS was approved in 2000 for use in children ages 6 through 15. The vaccine prevents the development of antibodies that would normally trigger a severe inflammatory response to infection. This leads to a gradual slowing down of disease activity. Current guidelines recommend the vaccination of all individuals at least four times during childhood.The CDC estimates that as many as 25,000 new cases of MS occur in the United States every year. About 2,500 of these newly diagnosed cases are women, and the vast majority of them suffer from multiple sclerosis with onset before age 30. Approximately 95 percent of all individuals with MS live with no disability beyond the limitations imposed by the disease itself, however, and are expected to live into their 60s or 70s.According to the National Institutes of Health, the average life expectancy for individuals with MS is 5.6 years less than those without MS. However, as much as half of all deaths due to MS can be prevented if early detection and treatment begins earlier. For example, MS sufferers tend to develop the disease at older ages. If they receive timely diagnosis and treatment, most of these individuals will avoid experiencing serious complications such as stroke or respiratory problems.In addition to the standard physical examination, you should also perform a thorough history and physical exam.

Methods: This is a prospective study of 517 actively managed MS patients enrolled at a single center. Results: More than 91% of patients were retained, with data ascertained up to 10 years after the baseline visit. At this last assessment, neurologic disability as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was stable or improved compared to baseline in 41% of patients. Subjects with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) by clinical and MRI criteria during the first 2 years had long-term outcomes that were no different from those of the cohort as a whole. 25-OH vitamin D serum levels were inversely associated with short-term MS disease activity; however, these levels had no association with long-term disability. At a median time of 16.8 years after disease onset, 10.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.2–14%) of patients reached an EDSS ≥ 6, and 18.1% (95% CI = 13.5–22.5%) evolved from relapsing MS to secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Interpretation: Rates of worsening and evolution to SPMS were substantially lower when compared to earlier natural history studies. Notably, the NEDA 2-year endpoint was not a predictor of long-term stability. Finally, the data call into question the utility of annual MRI assessments as a treat-to-target approach for MS care.

gpt2-large_59_multimedqa_7,"This question is not related to any other condition but it does require scientific information.\n Short-Term Effects Longer term effects of MS can be more severe, such as loss of motor skills and coordination, numbness or tingling in the arms and legs, trouble speaking, difficulty with swallowing, muscle weakness, blurred vision, cognitive impairment, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, increased risk for serious infections, and even death. These long term effects also include a greater chance that you will get cancer. For example, if you live in an area where the rate of MS is high enough to increase your risk of developing cancers, you may want to consider getting treatment early (for example, taking antibiotics after an infection). It is important to recognize what you should do when these long-term effects occur. The most appropriate course of action depends on the severity and time elapsed between the onset of symptoms and your doctor's diagnosis of MS. You need to determine whether you might benefit from some form of therapy or disease prevention. If there is no effective treatment available, or if you would like to try alternative therapies, discuss these options with your physician. Your doctor can recommend complementary or alternative treatments based on their proven effectiveness, safety, and cost. How Can I Treat Myself? To help prevent further complications from MS, many people prefer to avoid surgery altogether. But there are a few options that can make a difference. There is currently no cure for MS but there are several ways to reduce symptoms over time and slow down the progression of the disease. Treatment may consist of medications, lifestyle changes, exercise, and sometimes rehabilitation programs. However, the best way to treat yourself is by learning all the techniques and tools available so that you can use them effectively to manage your MS symptoms better.

When a patient begins a treatment regimen early in his or her disease course, disease activity is slowed. This not only reduces the number and severity of symptom flare-ups, as well as delays the progression of the disease (and possibly delays any related disability), but also reduces the number of active lesions that appear on an MRI. A 21-year prospective study of individuals (with relapsing-remitting MS) who began therapy early in the disease found that they experienced a longer lifespan than those who did not begin treatment as early. Of those who didn’t start treatment early, MS-related pulmonary infection was the most common cause of mortality over the 21-year period. Previously, all but one* of the approved treatments were only available for individuals with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) – largely for those with RRMS – and some are also approved for clinically isolated syndrome, prior to the diagnosis of MS. In 2017, Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab) was approved for two types of MS: relapsing forms of MS (RMS) and primary-progressive MS (PPMS). This is the first time that a medication for MS had been approved for these two types of the disease, and the first time that any medication had been approved to treat PPMS. Ocrevus is given via intravenous (IV) infusion every six months. Additionally, in 2019, Mayzent® (siponimod) oral tablets, Mavenclad® (cladribine) oral tablets, and Vumerity™ (diroximel fumarate) oral capsules were approved to treat RMS as well as active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), which is a more steady form of MS that follows RRMS, but still has relapses. While these are the only DMTs to be approved in recent years for active SPMS, the FDA is allowing some of the previously approved DMTs to add active SPMS to their indications. Mayzent and Vumerity are also approved for clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). *In 2000, Novantrone® (mitoxantrone), given via IV infusion, was approved for RRMS, SPMS, and worsening RRMS. However, side effects may include cardiac disease and leukemia, and for this reason, is seldom prescribed for individuals with MS. Additionally, Gilenya® (fingolimod), is the only DMT that is also approved for the treatment of children and adolescents, ages 10 through 17, with relapsing forms of MS. Young people under the age of 18 who are diagnosed with MS are referred to having “pediatric MS”; the vast majority (98 percent) of individuals with pediatric MS are diagnosed with the relapsing form of the disease. Research (including many clinical trials) is ongoing at a rigorous pace to find additional treatments for all forms of MS.

d1fce3b2-ac1f-4100-888f-a875e8f603eb,"Link Between Stress And Multiple Sclerosis Attacks A new study that combined results of previously published research findings suggests that acute attacks of multiple sclerosis may be associated with stressful life events. The study, appearing in the British Medical Journal and funded in part through National MS Society postdoctoral fellowships, is a “meta-analysis” (which statistically combines findings) of previously published studies of the topic of stress and MS. Background:Multiple sclerosis is thought to be an autoimmune disease that targets the brain and spinal cord. In its most common form (“relapsing-remitting MS”), neurological symptoms of the disease come and go in the form of acute attacks followed by periods of partial or complete recovery. It is still not known what causes MS, or what triggers relapses, although upper respiratory infections have been linked to relapses in some individuals. Although there have been many studies examining a possible link between stress and MS, conclusions have been controversial. This is because stress has many different meanings and has been defined and studied in many different ways that are hard to compare. Moreover, studies of stress and the long-term course of MS are lacking. Researchers use poop samples to establish baselines for stress, reproduction in gray whales Cannabis use dampens physiological response to stress in female rats MIPT researchers use zebrafish to study chronic stress The Study: David Mohr, PhD, and colleagues (University of California at San Francisco) searched the medical literature for studies from 1965 to February 2003 that contained the terms “stress,” “trauma,” and “multiple sclerosis.” The investigators independently reviewed the papers, analyzing methods, statistics, and outcomes. They excluded studies that focused solely on physical trauma or medical conditions, and also excluded studies that did not provide adequate details of methods and outcomes. National MS Society-funded postdoctoral fellows Laura Julian, PhD, and Darcy Cox, PsyD, contributed to the analysis. The authors included 14 studies that met their screening criteria, including studies that looked at MS relapses after diagnosis as well as initial MS attacks. In 13 out of 14 studies, the authors noted a significant increase in the likelihood of MS relapse following stressful life events, such as marital problems or financial difficulties. In one study however, stress was followed by a reduction in relapses. The authors conclude that these studies indicate a modest association between stressful events and MS relapses, but also note the limitations of their study. The quality of the studies they reviewed varied, and the authors of those studies did not always consider or report other factors (such as upper respiratory infections) that might have triggered relapses. Furthermore, the association between stress and relapse was not consistent among patients, or even in one individual over time.

d359081e-c45f-455e-ac2a-bfceab3db4b5,"Reviewed by MSAA Chief Medical Officer While we all know “MS” stands for “multiple sclerosis,” with so much exciting research reported in this edition of “What’s New in MS Research,” we can almost imagine that “MS” could also refer to the quest for “multiple solutions” in MS. Although a great deal of the research looks to further understand the biology, easing the symptoms, and slowing or stopping the physical damage of MS, the studies and other information presented here are very encouraging – and they are only a small sample of the vast array of research under way around the world. Most of the clinical trials and other studies featured in this issue of “What’s New in MS Research” are drawn from virtual presentations given at the September 2020 joint meeting of the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) and the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS). That meeting, held virtually this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was a forum for laboratory scientists and clinical investigators to share their findings from literally thousands of research efforts. As reflected in the reports that follow, those inquiries touch upon everything from enhancing the diagnosis of MS and better understanding its course, to evaluating the effectiveness and safety of approved disease-modifying therapies, investigational agents, and other types of interventions. Impact of Vumerity on brain-volume change: Encouraging interim findings People with relapsing MS who took the oral disease-modifying therapy Vumerity (diroximel fumarate) for up to two years had changes (reductions) in brain volume that approach those seen in people who do not have MS. That’s the encouraging finding from interim results of a study examining the long-term impact of the medication, which the FDA approved in October 2019. The study, EVOLVE-MS-1, is an ongoing, open-label Phase 3 investigation. Analysis of data on 365 patients who had taken Vumerity for a median of 96 weeks showed that their average percent of brain volume change (PBVC) was -0.36 from baseline to Week 48 and -0.35 from Week 48 to Week 96. Meanwhile, the estimated proportion of patients who were free of confirmed disability progression was 94.3% at Week 48 and 90.7% at Week 96. The proportions of patients with no evidence of disease activity at Week 48 and Week 96 were 44.7% and 25.2%, respectively. The study’s authors noted, “Interim findings from the ongoing EVOLVE-MS-1 study demonstrate that yearly PBVC in [Vumerity]-treated patients approached the rate observed in healthy adults.” Newly approved DMT shows efficacy in newly diagnosed, treatment-naïve patients In August, Kesimpta (ofatumumab) became the first self-administered targeted B-cell therapy approved by the FDA to treat relapsing forms of MS. A recent analysis of data from the Phase III ASCLEPIOS I/II trials that led to that approval provide insights into the efficacy and risk profile of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody in newly diagnosed patients who had not received any prior disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for their MS.

The role of PLCG2 in immune system signaling suggests it may also protect against other neurodegenerative diseases and possibly associates with longevity. We studied the effect of the rs72824905-G on seven neurodegenerative diseases and longevity, using 53,627 patients, 3,516 long-lived individuals and 149,290 study-matched controls. We replicated the association of rs72824905-G with reduced AD risk and we found an association with reduced risk of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We did not find evidence for an effect on Parkinson’s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS) risks, despite adequate sample sizes. Conversely, the rs72824905-G allele was associated with increased likelihood of longevity. By-proxy analyses in the UK Biobank supported the associations with both dementia and longevity.
