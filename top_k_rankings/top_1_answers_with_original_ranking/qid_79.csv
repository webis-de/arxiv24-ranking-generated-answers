chatgpt_79_multimedqa_6,"No, multiple sclerosis (MS) is not directly passed on from one family member to another. MS is considered to be a complex disease with a combination of genetic and environmental factors contributing to its development. While having a close family member with MS may increase your risk of developing the condition compared to the general population, it does not guarantee that you will develop it. The exact cause of MS is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic susceptibility and exposure to certain environmental triggers. If you have concerns about your risk of developing MS or if a family member has been diagnosed with the condition, it is recommended to speak with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice and guidance.",-0.0024131007958203
tiiuae_falcon-7b-instruct_79_multimedqa_6,"While there is currently no evidence suggesting that multiple sclerosis can be passed down through families, there is a higher risk of developing the condition if you have a close family member who has been diagnosed. In most cases, genetics play a small role in the development of multiple sclerosis, meaning that if you have a parent or sibling with MS, your risk of developing the condition is slightly increased. However, other factors such as age, gender, and environmental factors are also known to contribute to MS development. It's important to maintain a healthy lifestyle and consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns about your risk of developing MS.",-0.0024374795611947
gpt2-xl_79_multimedqa_1,"Yes! The risk of passing MS to the next generation is very low as long as you continue to take appropriate care of yourself. Your children are more likely than their siblings or parents to have another parent with MS. However, if your second child had MS and they were born before 1995 and there are any current relatives who also have the disease (and these relatives would not be affected by your symptoms), it's possible that those relatives will have MS. If this happens, your son may develop the disease but then he or she won't need treatment because he or she has no active disease. The best way to prevent passing the disease on to your descendants is for you to take good care of yourself and monitor your condition closely.

meta-llama_Llama-2-7b-chat-hf_79_multimedqa_10,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS), causing symptoms such as muscle weakness, vision problems, coordination issues, and cognitive impairments. While MS can be inherited in some cases, it is not contagious or transmissible between individuals through casual contact.Here's what you need to know about the risk of passing MS to other family members:\n1. Genetic factors play a role: MS has been found to have genetic components, with certain gene mutations increasing the likelihood of developing the condition. If your parents or grandparents have/had MS, your risk of inheriting the disorder may increase. However, most people with MS do not have a direct relative with the condition, suggesting that environmental triggers also contribute to its development.2. Inheritance patterns vary: The inheritance pattern of MS varies depending on the specific form of the disorder. For example, some forms of MS, like relapsing-remitting MS, tend to run in families more often than others, such as primary progressive MS.3. Risk assessment tools exist: Various online calculators and questionnaires can help determine your personalized risk for developing MS based on your family history and other factors. These tools can provide insight into whether your risk is higher compared to the general population due to familial connections alone.4. Consult a doctor for proper evaluation: Even if you have a family history of MS, only a qualified healthcare professional can diagnose you correctly after conducting a thorough examination and reviewing your medical history. Delaying consultation might result in misdiagnosis or failure to identify potential underlying causes of similar symptoms.5. Reassurance regarding transmission: Rest assured that MS cannot spread from person to person, even within close proximity. There is no evidence to suggest that touching someone with MS, sharing food utensils, or engaging in any social activity together poses a risk of transmitting the condition.In conclusion, while having a family history of MS does raise your individual risk slightly, it is essential to understand that this disabling illness is not contagious or transferable between individuals. Proper evaluations by trained professionals will assist in determining your personal risk level and appropriate management strategies for managing symptoms and improving quality of life.",-0.0043579610064625
gpt2-large_79_multimedqa_10,"Yes! One member of your extended family can be affected by MS (but is not likely). In fact, the risk of MS is much lower in second cousins than it is among first cousins. The disease occurs most commonly in people who have shared an ancestor with someone who has the disease or had close blood relatives who were affected. This means that you do not need to consider having an unaffected family member in your household if it is safe for them to become ill. It also implies that the symptoms of MS don't show up until after at least one person in your immediate family has already developed the disease.",-0.0044543333351612

Based on that analysis, researchers identified a group of 40 women at higher risk for developing MS, and 25 women at lower risk. Extensive neurological testing and MRI scanning uncovered possible neurological abnormalities in the higher risk group, and MRI abnormalities in a small proportion of both groups. “At this time, we are developing strategies to manage the risk of MS, but there is, as yet, no specific recommendation,” explains co-author Dr. Phillip De Jager. “Family members should be reassured that the vast majority of family members will not develop MS.” The team (including Zongqi Xia, MD, PhD, of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Daniel S. Reich, MD, PhD, of National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Bethesda, MD) has published results in () This study was supported by the National MS Society and the National Institutes of Health, and the Society helped to recruit participants. Two of the study authors – , and – are winners of the prestigious . An individual’s risk of developing MS increases if a close family member has MS. There is currently no way to predict which family members will develop MS. The goal of the Genes & Environment in MS (GEMS) study is to identify the genetic, environmental and immune profiles that may increase a person’s risk of developing MS. Researchers are recruiting 5,000 subjects who have at least one first-degree relative with a diagnosis of MS. The GEMS Study is gathering genetic material (DNA) and environmental exposure history from participants as well as blood samples and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an option. Investigators are classifying participants using the Genetic and Environmental Risk Score for MS Susceptibility (GERS), an experimental approach which incorporates genetic information and environmental exposures to identify people at higher or lower risk of developing MS. As part of this large-scale, ongoing study, researchers looked at 65 women who are first-degree relatives of people with MS. The GERS indicated that 40 of these women were at higher risk of developing MS, and 25 women were at lower risk of developing MS. These women underwent a comprehensive neurologic examination and MRI scans. Women in the higher risk group had less than normal vibration sensitivity in their big toes, a finding that indicates potential nerve dysfunction. A small percentage of the women in both groups had more MRI abnormalities associated with MS than one would expect to find in the general population.

Davey, Henry F. McFarland Although the human leukocyte antigen DR2/DQw1 allele has been associated with multiple sclerosis, studies of DR2/DQw1 inheritance in multiple sclerosis multiplex families have yielded conflicting results. We examined this question in 'high-incidence' families, defined as families with more than 50% of siblings affected. DR2/DQw1 allele frequencies were significantly increased, particularly in mothers and affected siblings (p <0.0001). The transmission of DR2/DQw1 from both parents was more frequent in affected offspring (p = 0.005). While evidence for segregation of disease with a particular parental allele was lacking in most families, the frequency of haplotype sharing was higher in affected sib pairs (p <0.01).
