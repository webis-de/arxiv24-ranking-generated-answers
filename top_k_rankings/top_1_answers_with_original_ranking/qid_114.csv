The symptoms experienced by patients who have borderline personality disorder vary from person to person but generally include: Anxious, nervous, anxious, depressed, irritable, suspicious, angry, hostile, withdrawn, tense, jealous, hypervigilant and preoccupied with fantasies of harm or death. Unsteady sleep patterns; difficulty falling asleep at night or staying asleep. \r Frequent nightmares that cause excessive concern, fear, anxiety or distress. A high level of anger in the face of criticism or rejection. Impulsivity, impulsive behavior such as shopping or substance use. Tendency to act impulsively, often making poor life decisions. Disorganized thoughts which frequently make predictions about the future that turn out untrue. Unpredictability about when events will occur and/or what they will involve. Extreme changes in mood, energy, appetite, sex drive, social relationships or interest. Irritability or hostility toward others or self. Poor judgment or impulse control. Lack of motivation or interest in activities that once engaged in. Depression. Sexual difficulties and dissatisfaction, including sexual problems related to infidelity. Behavioral changes that can range from minor to severe. The diagnosis of borderline personality disorder is primarily based upon four diagnostic criteria: (1) A pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating periods of intense feelings of emptiness and intense emotions of love, affection, security and worthlessness; (2) Persistent unstable interpersonal relationships that lack predictability, coherence, or change over time; (3) Excessive and unreasonably risky or irresponsible behaviors, particularly involving sex, in response to extreme negative emotional states; and (4) Significant impairment of functioning due largely to a marked deficit in empathy, guilt sensitivity and affective regulation. Although these diagnostic criteria are well established clinically, it remains unclear whether there is an appropriate scientific basis for their application in clinical practice. For example, clinicians need to evaluate whether these three factors adequately reflect the symptomatology experienced by the patient.",-0.011119894683361

Unstable self-image: Those with BPD may have an unclear sense of self and struggle with identity issues. They may experience rapid changes in self-perception, values, goals, and career choices. 3. Impulsive and risky behavior: BPD individuals may engage in impulsive activities without considering potential consequences. This can include reckless driving, substance abuse, unsafe sex, binge eating, or self-harm. 4. Emotional instability: People with BPD often experience intense and rapidly shifting emotions. They may have frequent mood swings, feelings of emptiness, anger outbursts, and difficulty regulating their emotions. 5. Fear of abandonment: Individuals with BPD may exhibit an intense fear of being abandoned or left alone. They may go to great lengths to avoid real or perceived abandonment, which can lead to unhealthy relationship patterns. 6. Self-destructive behavior: BPD individuals may engage in self-harming behaviors such as cutting or burning themselves. These actions are often done as a way to cope with emotional pain or to feel a sense of control. 7. Chronic feelings of emptiness: People with BPD often describe a persistent feeling of emptiness or a lack of purpose in life.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a condition characterized by impulsiveness, mood instability, negative self-image, and episodes of self-injury and attempted suicide. While the exact underlying causes and pathophysiological processes are yet to be identified, a combination of genetics, environmental factors, and a history of childhood trauma have all been shown to contribute to the development of the disorder. Pharmacists are an important part of the multidisciplinary healthcare team that manages patients with BPD. Psychotherapy should be utilized as the primary treatment for BPD, although pharmacotherapeutic agents are often prescribed for the management of symptoms. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a psychological condition characterized by a pattern of impulsiveness and mood instability. The word is a complex term used to describe the way someone thinks, feels, and behaves, underpinning that individual’s sense of self. BPD is associated with an increased risk of suicide together with fears of abandonment. Patients with BPD feel empty and have a negative self-image. While BPD and bipolar disorder (types I and II) display over-lapping symptoms, there are certain features that distinguish the two. In particular, the pattern of affective instability, a prominent feature in both disorders, varies. Patients with BPD demonstrate transient mood shifts that occur in response to interpersonal stressors, whereas bipolar disorder is associated with sustained mood changes. Recent studies have shown that BPD is present in about 6% of primary care patients in community-based samples and in 15% to 20% of patients in psychiatric hospitals and outpatient clinics. The majority of these patients tend to be female, with rates as high as 75% in clinical settings. Most patients with BPD are admitted into a treatment facility following a suicide attempt or an episode of deliberate self-injury. The average risk of suicide attempt is 60% to 70%, and about 10% of BPD patients die of suicide (this figure is particularly high for young women). On average, patients remain in the hospital for 6.3 days per year and make nearly one emergency room visit every 2 years. These rates are six to 12 times higher than those among patients with a major depressive disorder. These figures translate to a large economic burden, with the use of expensive healthcare resources, persistent lack of patient productivity, and emotional costs, as well as other costs related to a variety of behaviors such as domestic violence, reckless driving, imprisonment, and pathologic gambling. Patients with BPD have characteristically unstable moods and express feeling “up” and “down” without any explanation. Since the person’s thoughts and feelings can be difficult to manage, many patients resort to different ways of self-harm, such as cutting, ligaturing (strangulation), or overdosing on drugs, as a way of managing distress. Those with BPD may experience difficulty maintaining social relationships, and conflicts with other individuals often lead to social isolation and problems at work. Furthermore, they tend to have intense but short-lived relationships due to problematic attachment patterns. Psychotic symptoms may occur, but are usually brief, circumscribed, or accompanied by good reality testing. Patients with BPD may manifest over-whelming anger when in",-0.0361104421317577

Treatment can be hard, and getting better can take years. Problems with emotions and behaviors are hard to improve. But with treatment, most people with severe symptoms do get better over time. Experts don't know exactly what causes borderline personality disorder. Problems with chemicals in the brain that help control moods may play a role. It also seems to run in families. Often, people who get it faced some kind of childhood trauma such as abuse, neglect, or the death of a parent. The risk is higher when people who had childhood trauma also have problems coping with anxiety or stress. Everyone has problems with emotions or behaviors sometimes. But if you have borderline personality disorder, the problems are severe, repeat over a long time, and disrupt your life. The most common symptoms include: Harmful, impulsive behaviors.
