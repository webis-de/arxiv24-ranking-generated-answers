In a review that combined data from 35 studies, published this month in the , researchers conclude that the technologies are successful at inducing a small to moderate change in activity levels. The study’s findings suggest that offering wearables and apps on prescription could be beneficial to those at risk of the negative health implications of inactivity, such as cardiovascular disease, certain types of cancer, and more. Fitness Trackers. Image Credit: Syda Productions/Shutterstock.com Around the world, around 1.4 billion adults (over 25% of the adult population) fail to meet daily recommended physical activity levels. These figures are concerning, given that physical inactivity is considered to be a leading cause of death globally, costing health services billions each year. Various studies have linked physical inactivity with numerous serious health implications, including coronary heart disease, depression, types of cancer (such as breast and colon), high blood pressure, stroke, type two diabetes, and obesity. Physical inactivity is also associated with a greater risk of death of any cause. Strategies that aim to target and change behaviors are considered to be among the most effective techniques at increasing physical activity. Smartphone apps and wearable activity trackers incorporate self-monitoring and feedback that are designed to encourage users to be more active. Given the widespread use of smartphones, with roughly half of the word estimated to own one, and activity trackers and fitness apps used by roughly a third of adults in the US and the UK, apps, and fitness trackers offer an opportunity to target a wide segment of the population. However, until now, studies reviewing the efficacy of these apps and trackers at increasing activity levels had produced inconsistent results, nor had they investigated the impact of these strategies on healthy adults. Physical activity in the morning could have a beneficial effect against cancer Physical activity could mitigate some of the menopause symptoms Facemasks do not diminish lung function during physical activity, shows study The new study aimed to fill these gaps in knowledge. To achieve this, a team of researchers reviewed relevant studies published between January 2007 and January 2020 that involved healthy participants aged 18-65 who had no long-term health conditions. A total of 28 studies were selected and included in the meta-analysis, which pooled and analyzed the data of over 7,000 people. The results revealed that use smartphone apps or activity trackers were successful at increasing a person’s average daily step count by 1,850 steps. Further analysis reversed that smartphone apps and activity trackers significantly increased users' general physical activity levels. The results also concluded that certain features were more effective at increasing levels of physical activity, such a text-message prompts tailored features, goal setting, planning, and tasks differentiated by their level of difficulty.

Also Read - Victoria Goodyear, a pedagogical researcher from the varsity reportedly said that there are currently over 160,000 health apps available on the major app stores focussed on wellness, diet and exercise and they are of particular interest to young people, however, most of these apps are designed for adults.

In addition, schools, peers and parents were powerful influencers over the types of apps and devices young people used. Importantly, many of the participants were able to disregard content that was either irrelevant to them, potentially harmful to their bodies, or simply ‘boring’.

When you do decide to go monthly, you should always check to make sure that you don't miss any activity. Some devices charge extra for each day you didn't log or take any action for that day. 4.
