chatgpt_112_multimedqa_7,"Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. These symptoms can vary in severity and frequency among individuals. Common symptoms of asthma include: 1. Coughing: A persistent cough, especially at night or early in the morning, is a common symptom of asthma. It may be accompanied by phlegm production. 2. Wheezing: Wheezing is a high-pitched whistling sound produced during breathing due to narrowed airways. It is a classic symptom of asthma. 3. Shortness of breath: Individuals with asthma often experience difficulty breathing, feeling as if they cannot get enough air in or out of their lungs. 4. Chest tightness: Some people with asthma may feel a sensation of tightness or pressure in their chest. This symptom can be distressing and may lead to anxiety. 5. Increased respiratory rate: Asthma can cause an increased respiratory rate, where a person may breathe faster than usual in an attempt to get enough air. It is important to note that symptoms can vary from person to person and may also vary over time. Asthma symptoms are often triggered by certain factors, such as allergens (e.g., pollen, dust mites), irritants (e.g., smoke, strong odors), respiratory infections, exercise, and changes in weather. If you suspect you or someone you know has asthma, it is important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and to develop an appropriate treatment plan.",-0.0427896603941917

Here are some common symptoms of asthma:\n1. Wheezing: A high-pitched whistling sound when breathing out, which occurs due to narrowed or constricted airways. This is often the most noticeable symptom of asthma.\n2. Coughing: Persistent coughing, especially at night or in the morning, is another common symptom of asthma. The cough may be dry or produce mucus, and it can be triggered by exposure to allergens or irritants.\n3. Chest Tightness: Feeling of tightness or heaviness in the chest, which can make it difficult to breathe properly. This sensation can range from mild discomfort to severe distress.\n4. Shortness of Breath: Difficulty breathing or feeling winded even when performing normal activities. This can occur during an asthma attack or as a result of persistent inflammation in the airways.\n5. Quick Shallow Breaths: People with asthma may take quick shallow breaths in an attempt to compensate for difficulty breathing. This can lead to feelings of anxiety or panic.\n6. Blue Lips or Fingers (in severe cases): Inadequate oxygen supply to the body can cause blue discoloration of the lips or fingers, which is a sign of severe asthma attack that requires immediate medical attention.\n7.

Asthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack. Asthma can't be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. Because asthma often changes over time, it's important that you work with your doctor to track your signs and symptoms and adjust treatment as needed. Asthma symptoms vary from person to person. You may have infrequent asthma attacks, have symptoms only at certain times—such as when exercising—or have symptoms all the time.

gpt2-xl_112_multimedqa_7,"Asthma is the most common breathing disorder in America. It can cause serious shortness of breath or difficulty breathing through your nose. Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, rapid or irregular heartbeat, and shortness of breath.\n How many Americans suffer from asthma? Answer: In 2008, the CDC reported that an estimated 26 million people had asthma as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). This estimate was based on data collected between 1990 and 2000 from 4,722 adults in the United States who were interviewed for the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and asked whether they had ever had asthma. A total of 12.3% of those surveyed said yes, while 44.2% of all respondents said no. The percentage of those with asthma who have been diagnosed is even higher—approximately 50%. Asymptomatic asthmatics may not be aware that their condition exists because symptoms often go unnoticed and become increasingly worse over time. They could experience symptoms such as cough, runny nose, fever, or sore throat. As well, people with asthma may develop phlegm, which results from excessive mucus production in the lungs.\r The symptoms associated with asthma affect both children and adults. Children usually present with shortness of breath, wheezing, and wheeze that gets louder and lasts longer than usual. People who have asthma may also experience wheezing when they cough, sneeze, or breathe deeply. Adults may find it harder to breathe at rest or when walking or exercising. Some people can't wear certain types of clothing without feeling suffocatingly full. And people with asthma may avoid being around other people if they're having trouble breathing. \r What causes asthma? Asthma symptoms occur in response to inflammation. When you breathe in smoke, pollen, dust, or other irritants, your body makes chemicals called histamine. These chemicals trigger release of airways cells called bronchioles that become inflamed, leading to symptoms like hives, itching, or itchy eyes. \r When you inhale airborne particles or gases, these substances settle into the respiratory tract where they are carried away by the wind. If the irritation continues, bronchial cell membranes expand further, creating scar tissue and swelling. The result is a thickening and narrowing of the bronchial tubes, causing more obstruction of airflow in the lung. It's important to realize that although there is some",-0.0958435758948326

gpt2-large_112_multimedqa_5,"Symptoms of asthma may include wheezing or coughing followed by shortness of breath and chest pain and urgency to breathe, although they can be caused by many different things including stress or allergies, infection, or other conditions, such as high blood pressure. The cause is not known for sure but has been linked with several factors, including genetics, environmental exposures, obesity, inflammation, and chronic illnesses. There are multiple types of asthma that range in severity and the most serious types can be fatal; however, the majority of these cases do not require medical attention. The best way to diagnose your condition is through an objective test, which includes blood tests and allergy testing. If you have suspected or documented asthma, seek treatment immediately. If you are at risk for developing asthma, it's important to obtain periodic medical evaluation. Call a doctor or visit a local emergency room if you suspect that you might develop asthma. The American Lung Association recommends that people use their own judgment when deciding whether to take asthma medicines for relief, particularly if taking medication could pose risks. Most doctors recommend against using prescription medications to treat asthma because of potential side effects (see below), but some doctors also advise patients to try alternative medicine treatments. Some natural products that contain ingredients similar to those found in over-the-counter drugs may offer benefits over traditional inhalers, depending on how often you're exposed to them. For example, tea tree oil, cinnamon bark extract, vitamin E, and fenugreek leaf extract may help reduce the severity of symptoms of asthma, while coffee contains anthocyanins -- naturally occurring compounds that may slow the development of asthma. In addition, supplements may be beneficial if used regularly. These supplements should be taken only under the supervision of a healthcare provider who understands the proper dosages and dosing methods, according to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA). Your doctor will monitor your progress carefully so that you don't experience any adverse reactions after starting any type of supplement therapy. Symptoms of Asthma Common symptoms of asthma include wheezing or coughing followed by shortness of breath and chest pain and urgency to breathe, although they can be caused by many different things including stress or allergies, infection, or other conditions, such as high blood pressure.
