It seeks to understand how all these parts interact together in order to achieve optimal wellness."" --- Hi there! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about health and wellness. Today, you asked me about holistic medicine. That's a great topic! Holistic medicine is an approach that focuses on treating the entire person, not just their physical body or one specific symptom. This means considering your mental, spiritual, and emotional well-being when developing a treatment plan. The goal is to find balance and harmony within yourself so you can achieve optimal wellness. So, what does holistic medicine include? Here are some key components: 1. Mind-Body Connection: Holistic practitioners believe that our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs play a significant role in our overall health. They may use techniques like meditation, deep breathing exercises, or guided imagery to help you connect with your inner self and release stress. 2. Nutrition and Lifestyle Changes: A holistic approach often involves making changes to your diet and lifestyle habits. For example, eating more fruits and vegetables, reducing sugar intake, getting regular exercise, and finding ways to manage stress. 3. Natural Therapies: Holistic medicine may incorporate natural therapies such as acupuncture, herbal remedies, homeopathy, and massage. These treatments aim to stimulate healing processes while minimizing side effects. 4. Alternative Medicine: Some holistic practitioners may also explore alternative medical systems like traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) or Ayurveda, which emphasize balancing the flow of energy within the body. 5. Integrative Care: Many holistic practitioners work collaboratively with conventional medical professionals to provide integrative care. This ensures you receive the best possible treatment from both perspectives. 6. Personalized Treatment Plans: Holistic medicine recognizes each individual has unique needs and circumstances. Practitioners will work closely with you to develop personalized treatment plans tailored to your specific situation. 7. Focus on Prevention: Rather than",-0.004448399413377

Holistic practitioners often take a comprehensive and individualized approach to patient care, considering their lifestyle, environment, and overall health goals.

For example, ""holistic"" also includes nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress management, mental well being, and more. What is holistic medicine and what does it include? Healthcare professionals use the term ""holistic"" to refer to all aspects of health and disease management that are not primarily focused on symptoms or diseases alone. For example, ""holistic"" also includes nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress management, mental well being, and more. Question: How does holistic health work?\nAnswer: The concept of holistic health can be broadly categorized into four main areas: homeopathy, herbalism, naturopathy, and integrative medicine.\nHomeopathic remedies (drugs designed to help heal specific illnesses) may also be used by physicians for other ailments. In addition, certain natural products (e.g., vitamins, minerals, herbs), as well as dietary supplements (such as fish oil and omega-3 fatty acids) have been shown to contain significant amounts of beneficial compounds called antioxidants. \nHerbalists believe that healthy lifestyles help maintain a balance in the body's antioxidant enzymes; however, many modern-day treatments for chronic illnesses such as cancer rely heavily on these same antioxidants. Naturopathic practitioners believe that the healing properties of plants and medicines should be incorporated into the treatment process with regular administration to reduce side effects. \nIntegrative medicine combines conventional and complementary therapies based on scientific principles. Many integrators believe that this form of treatment is much more effective than traditional treatments because they combine traditional treatments with new, emerging ones that target multiple systems. Traditional health approaches tend to focus on symptom reduction through diet, exercise, sleep, stress relief, and medication. But when combined with current research findings showing how the body processes and responds to specific drugs and foods, integrators have been able to develop highly effective strategies to combat chronic conditions like cancer and heart disease. \nQuestion: What are some examples of homeopathic remedies?\nAnswers: Most homeopaths and herbalists recommend using one of two main types of remedy: homeopathic decoction or homeopathic infusion.\nDecoctions are prepared drinks made from ingredients similar to those found in nature, such as dried herbs, roots, leaves, bark, flowers, and spices. They're usually diluted 1:1 or 2:1. Decoctions are often recommended",-0.0087188752368092

Four aspects of being relate to the four elements: spirit (fire), thoughts (air), emotions (water), physical (earth). Holistic healing addresses the underlying causes of illness or disease from the perspective of the whole person as opposed to addressing the symptoms only. This type of healing incorporates the concept of —the idea that the whole is more than merely the sum of its parts. Thus, holistic medicine is a system of healing therapeutics, typically outside mainstream scientific medicine, which might involve various modalities such as naturopathy, homeopathy, psychotherapy, nutrition therapy, as well as various stress relief aids. You might be wondering what constitutes a “whole person” anyway? This term will obviously mean different things to different people, but I think most people will agree that we all experience life in at least four different aspects of being. The four key aspects of being include the spiritual (fire), mental (air), emotional (water), and physical (earth). According to quantum physics, the essence of all life is energy. This is not theory; it is fact. We also know that to a large degree, whether energy flows freely within us or not determines our health, happiness, success, and longevity. Thus, blockages in the physical body, the psyche, or even the spirit can lead to disturbances in the natural energy flow in the body. According to ancient Chinese medicine, these blockages of energy, in the most simplistic terms, are the cause of disease. The flow of energy in our physical body has a lot to do with water. Since most adult bodies are composed of at least 70% water, it is easy to understand how important it is to stay hydrated. Just think of the difference between a flowing stream of water in the mountains compared to a stagnant pool of water that is drying up. The flowing stream is clean and charged with electrical energy, whereas the stagnant water is dirty and harbors unhealthy microorganisms. When our bodies are dehydrated, the tissues become dry, the colon becomes constipated, the blood becomes sticky and thicker, and cells do not get adequate hydration, nutrients, and oxygenation. Water is a solvent and the primary means of transport in the body. Water regulates all functions of the body, including the activity of the solutes it carries throughout the body. Water delivers key nutrients, enzymes, hormones and other essential substances to tissue and cells, and adequate water is needed to safely and effectively remove toxins through the processes of detoxification. This means that we need to be on a daily basis to stay hydrated and to facilitate movement and energy flow in the physical body. Medical researchers estimate that about 80 percent of all doctor visits are stress related! The stress response in the body often arises out of habitual patterns of thinking that create undesirable emotions such as anxiety, depression, unhappiness, fear, and agitation. These emotions, in turn, produce chemical messengers in the body that wreak havoc at the cellular level and decrease",-0.0408255048096179

So what is holistic therapy? Holistic therapy refers to the treatment of a person’s health with regards to their mind, body, spirit and emotional state. Holistic therapy may include non-medicinal treatment methods. It often aims to deliver optimal health by using natural or culturally sanctioned remedies. Physical, spiritual or emotional imbalances can cause disruptions in a person’s overall health. Holistic remedies seek to achieve or restore balance. Holistic medicine is a practice centered around the belief that . Practitioners of holistic medicine believe that positive changes require high self esteem and that people have the power to heal themselves. Holistic medicine asks participants to become self-sufficient and self-reliant, but also to know when to ask for help. This help should use a team approach that involves active listening from a therapist or practitioner. Staying connected to others is important and helps create a sense of grounding. The practice also asks people to be forgiving of themselves and to not expect perfection. One of the most critical principles of holistic medicine is this: Holistic practice asks participants to live life consciously rather than on autopilot. Though they sound interchangeable, complementary and alternative therapy describe two different approaches to treatment. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, the between complementary and alternative therapies is: If a non-mainstream practice is used together with conventional medicine, it’s considered “complementary.” If a non-mainstream practice is used in place of conventional medicine, it’s considered “alternative.” Truly alternative medicine and therapy is not very common, as most who utilize holistic approaches integrate them into conventional treatment. By definition, complementary and alternative therapies are different from conventional medicine. There is not robust evidence that proves their effectiveness or safety (randomized controlled clinical trials are considered the best evidence). However, many people with holistic philosophies use complementary practices along with conventional medicine to improve well-being.

Christian Smutz brought the concept of holism to the modern era with his book Holism and Revolution. This background was highlighted in greater detail in my previous post on Wholistic vs Holistic Cancer Treatment. The general concept is that the whole transcends the individual parts. Holistic medicine is a non-compartmentalized approach to healthcare. With less information, the ancients were more holistic in their approach than the experts of today, who have significantly more information. A holistic approach to cancer is no different. A holistic approach to cancer is found in causation, testing, treatment, and in maintenance therapy. It is holistic in the whole sense of the word.

To condense the quantity of information in this post, I will break up into a series of posts. I want to highlight each point in detail individually. Conventional medicine continues to push denial on the connection between lifestyle, particularly diet and cancer. The science is precise on the matter. In contrast to the opinion often espoused by physicians, including conventional Oncologists, we are products of our collective environment, and it is our lifestyle choices that dictate much of our cellular environment. No matter the denial, the evidence points to the contrary. What we put in our mouth effects cancer risk and cancer healing. Our nutrition choices, or lack there of, can benefit the whole of the body or damage the whole of the body. Lifestyle can include diet, stress, sleep/wake cycles, relationships, exercise/activity level, weight, home, and many others. A highlighted the connection between diet and cancer . In this study model, dietary choices increase the toxicity of chemotherapy up to . The mechanism, by researchers at the University of Virginia, was found to be through the dietary alterations in the gut microbiome. I have often said that diet is love language, or not, with our DNA. This study shows that diet is the means to alter the gut microbiome to increase or possibly decrease chemotherapy toxicity. In essence, the lifestyle choice of what we put in our mouth lays the groundwork for toxicity from chemotherapy. So much for the idea that nutrition plays no role in cancer treatment. In fact, If doctors are telling patients with cancer to eat whatever they want, i.e. hamburgers, steak, sugar… they are in effect increasing the toxicity and morbidity of treatment in patients. Their is an important phrase that should be on the tongue of every physician—“first do no harm”. This study just focused on diet.
