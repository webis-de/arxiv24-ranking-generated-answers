(Definition: head forward, shoulders rounded, and back slumped.) This position, also known as “text neck,” is a real epidemic. People spend approximately five hours every day looking at their phones — and that can lead to some serious text-neck aches and pains, explains chiropractor , DC, of Cappo Chiropractic & Sports Therapy. Researchers at Harvard Medical Health predict that will experience neck aches at some point in their lives. Here’s what text neck does to your body: It compresses and tightens the muscle, tendon, and ligament structures in front of the neck while lengthening the muscles, tendon, and ligament structures behind the neck. “The human head weighs 10 pounds. For every inch your head is tilted forward, the weight your neck has to carry doubles,” explains Cappo. Overtime, that extra strain adds up. But ditching our devices isn’t really an option. Instead, what we can do is make sure we exercise right and practice good habits to prevent the aches and pains associated with text neck. Strengthening and stretching your muscles may help alleviate some of that nagging neck pain, says Aixa Goodrich DC, FMP, of . So, with the help of professional chiropractors, we rounded up the best equipment-free stretches and exercises. Incorporate these into your daily routine one to three times a day to help show text neck who’s boss.

Pause here and let your jaw relax and open your mouth. Now see if you can bring your head further back an inch or two (typically you can). Keep your head still here and bring your lower jaw to your upper jaw, closing your mouth. You should feel a stretch in the front of your neck. Downward-Facing Dog is useful for opening the anterior chest wall and shoulders — which are often rounded and tightened from excessive tech usage, Goodrich points out.
