meta-llama_Llama-2-13b-chat-hf_126_multimedqa_2,"Birth control pills (BCPs) can affect the suppression of antral follicle count (AFC), which is a measure of ovarian reserve and fertility potential. Here's what you need to know:\n1. What is AFC? Antral follicle count (AFC) refers to the number of small follicles in both ovaries that are visible on ultrasound imaging during the early stages of the menstrual cycle. These follicles range in size from 2-9 mm in diameter. Higher AFC is associated with better ovarian reserve and higher pregnancy chances,\n2. How do BCPs suppress AFC? BCPs contain hormones like estrogen and progesterone that regulate ovulation and menstruation. When taken consistently, these hormones prevent ovulation and thicken cervical mucus to prevent sperm entry into the uterus. This suppression of ovulation leads to a decrease in AFC. The exact mechanism of how BCPs reduce AFC isn't fully understood, but it may be due to the following factors:\na) Inhibition of gonadotropin secretion: BCPs suppress the production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Elevated levels of these hormones stimulate the growth of follicles and ovulation. By reducing FSH and LH, BCPs limit the development of new follicles and cause existing ones to shrink, resulting in lower AFC;\nb) Reduction of oxidative stress: Oxidative stress plays a role in follicular development and aging. BCPs have antioxidant properties that might help protect follicles against damage caused by free radicals, leading to improved AFC; however, this theory needs further research to confirm its relevance. \n3. Does every type of BCP suppress AFC equally? No. Different types of BCPs may vary in their effects on AFC due to differences in their formulations and dosages. Some studies suggest that certain progestins, such as levonorgestrel and norethindrone, tend to decrease AFC more than others, like desogestrel and gestodene.

Antral follicle count (AFC) is a blood test that measures the number of small fluid-filled sacs on the ovary, which contain eggs. A lower AFC count may indicate infertility or anovulation, which can be treated with medications or surgery. However, it is important to note that AFC testing may not be accurate in predicting ovulation, and therefore may not be as effective as other methods of birth control.

meta-llama_Llama-2-7b-chat-hf_126_multimedqa_6,"Birth control pill use can suppress the growth of antral follicles in the ovaries. Antral follicles are small, immature follicles that contain one or more egg cells. Suppressing these follicles can help reduce ovulation and prevent pregnancy. However, it's essential to understand how this works and what to expect when using birth control pills. Here's a detailed explanation of how birth control pills affect antral follicle counts:\nHow Birth Control Pills Affect Antral Follicle Counts\nBirth control pills work by preventing ovulation through several mechanisms, including:)\n1. Inhibition of gonadotropin release: Birth control pills suppress the production of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which are crucial for ovulation. When LH and FSH levels are low, ovulation does not occur.) 2. Progesterone effect on the endometrium: Birth control pills contain progesterone, which helps thicken the uterine lining. This thicker lining makes it harder for a fertilized egg to implant, reducing the chances of pregnancy.) 3. Hormonal changes: The estrogen and progestogen in birth control pills alter the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, leading to reduced antral follicle count. Estrogen promotes the growth and maturation of follicles, while progestogens may directly inhibit follicular growth.) It is important to note that the exact mechanism by which birth control pills suppress antral follicle counts is still being researched and debated. Some studies suggest that the combined effects of estrogen and progestogen might be responsible for the observed suppression, while others propose that the direct action of progestogen on the granulosa cells within the follicles could also play a role.) Regardless of the exact mechanism, it is clear that birth control pills can significantly impact antral follicle counts. Studies have shown that women who take contraceptives tend to have fewer antral follicles than those who do not use them.)

chatgpt_126_multimedqa_3,"Birth control pills work by suppressing the natural hormonal fluctuations of the menstrual cycle. This suppression prevents the release of an egg from the ovaries, thereby preventing pregnancy. Antral follicle count, on the other hand, is a measure used during fertility assessments to estimate a woman's ovarian reserve. It involves counting the number of small follicles present in the ovaries at the beginning of the menstrual cycle. Taking birth control pills does not directly affect the antral follicle count. The suppression of the menstrual cycle caused by birth control pills can temporarily decrease the number of visible follicles during an ultrasound examination, but this is a reversible effect. Once a person stops using birth control pills, the normal menstrual cycle and follicle development resumes. Therefore, birth control pills do not impact the actual number of antral follicles a person has. It is important to note that antral follicle count is mainly used as an indicator of a woman's remaining egg supply and fertility potential. If you have concerns about your antral follicle count or fertility, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or a reproductive specialist who can provide personalized guidance and advice.",-0.00588861387223

Reuter, , La Tasha B. Craig, Denny Sakkas, Eric Surrey, Kevin J. Doody, Emily S. Jungheim, Aykut B. Bayrak, Martin Hund, Wilma D.J. Verhagen-Kamerbeek, Deborah Pardue, Katharina Buck, Barbara Timm Research question: What concentration of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) corresponds to an antral follicle count (AFC) >15 for determination of ovarian reserve? Design: A prospective study conducted at 13 US fertility clinics in women aged 21–44 years who presented for AFC evaluation by transvaginal ultrasound. Serum samples were collected at the time of AFC evaluation (menstrual cycle day 2–4). AMH concentrations were measured by the Elecsys AMH immunoassay; oestradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations were also measured. The serum AMH cut-off able to detect AFC >15 with high sensitivity was determined (derivation cohort). Clinical performance of the AMH assay at the derived cut-off was evaluated (validation cohort). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were also performed. Results: In the derivation cohort (n = 306), an optimal serum AMH cut-off value of 1.77 ng/ml was determined to correspond to AFC >15 with 89.63% sensitivity and 69.01% specificity, using the Elecsys AMH assay. In the validation cohort (n = 856), this 1.77 ng/ml cut-off could identify women with an AFC >15 with a sensitivity of 88.34% and a specificity of 68.29%; corresponding positive predictive and negative predictive values were 75.19% and 84.34%, respectively. ROC analyses demonstrated that AMH performed better than oestradiol or FSH in predicting AFC, with area under the curves of 85.7%, 57.1% and 69.7%, respectively, in the validation cohort. Conclusion: The Elecsys AMH immunoassay provides a robust and fully automated method to measure serum AMH levels. Women with AMH values below the cut-off of 1.77 ng/ml are unlikely to have AFC >15.

Hannon, Katherine E. Brannick, Wei Wang, Rupesh K. Gupta, Jodi A. Flaws Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a ubiquitous environmental toxicant found in consumer products that causes ovarian toxicity. Antral follicles are the functional ovarian units and must undergo growth, survival from atresia, and proper regulation of steroidogenesis to ovulate and produce hormones. Previous studies have determined that DEHP inhibits antral follicle growth and decreases estradiol levels in vitro; however, the mechanism by which DEHP elicits these effects is unknown. The present study tested the hypothesis that DEHP directly alters regulators of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and steroidogenesis to inhibit antral follicle functionality. Antral follicles from adult CD-1 mice were cultured with vehicle control or DEHP (1-100. μg/ml) for 24-96. h to establish the temporal effects of DEHP on the follicle. Following 24-96. h of culture, antral follicles were subjected to gene expression analysis, and media were subjected to measurements of hormone levels. DEHP increased the mRNA levels of cyclin D2, cyclin dependent kinase 4, cyclin E1, cyclin A2, and cyclin B1 and decreased the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A prior to growth inhibition. Additionally, DEHP increased the mRNA levels of BCL2-associated agonist of cell death, BCL2-associated X protein, BCL2-related ovarian killer protein, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2, and Bcl2-like 10, leading to an increase in atresia. Further, DEHP decreased the levels of progesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone prior to the decrease in estradiol levels, with decreased mRNA levels of side-chain cleavage, 17α-hydroxylase-17,20-desmolase, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and aromatase.

Tannenbaum, Christina Borgeest, Jodi A. Flaws Background: Methoxychlor (MXC) is specifically known to target ovarian antral follicles, increasing atresia (death via apoptosis) in them. This is of concern because females are born with a finite pool of ovarian follicles. Only limited studies have explored the phenomenon of a reduced fertility threshold for effect based on the percentage of antral follicle atresia. Methods: In this article, we report on adult female CD-1 mice exposed intraperitoneally to various doses of MXC for 5, 10, 20, and 30 days. In the 20-day treatment, mice were dosed with either the vehicle or MXC at 64 or 96 mg/kg/day, whereas in the 30-day treatment, mice were dosed with vehicle or MXC at 48, 64, or 96 mg/kg/day. The mice that were dosed with MXC for 30 days were also mated with untreated males for a determination of overall fertility. Results: A significantly increased percentage (50%) of atretic antral follicles was observed only after 20 and 30 days of treatment. Specifically, mice treated with MXC64 for 20 and 30 days had an increased percentage of atretic antral follicles compared with vehicle-treated mice. Interestingly, mice dosed with MXC96 had an increased percentage of atretic antral follicles after 30 days, but not after 20 days of treatment compared with vehicle-treated mice. Overall fertility of the mice was not different compared with controls. Conclusions: The results indicate that as much as a 50% increase in atretic antral follicles does not affect the immediate fertility of the mice.
