Here are some common symptoms associated with hypothyroidism: \nWeight Gain: One of the most common symptoms of hypothyroidism is weight gain, particularly in the midsection of the body. As the metabolism slows down, it becomes harder to lose weight, even with a healthy diet and exercise routine. \nFatigue or Lethargy: Hypothyroidism can cause extreme fatigue, lethargy, and lack of energy, making it difficult to perform daily tasks or engage in physical activity. This can be due to the decreased production of thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolism and energy levels. \nCold Intolerance: People with hypothyroidism may feel cold more easily than usual, as their bodies have difficulty producing heat. This can lead to feelings of chilliness, numbness, and poor circulation. \nDry Skin: Dry skin is another common symptom of hypothyroidism, characterized by rough, scaly patches on the skin, especially on the arms, legs, and torso. \nHair Loss: Hair loss (alopecia) is a classic sign of hypothyroidism, caused by the slowing of hair growth and eventual thinning or falling out of hair follicles. \nBrain Fog or Memory Problems: Mental fogginess, confusion, or memory problems are also frequent symptoms of hypothyroidism, possibly related to the impact of low thyroid hormone levels on brain function. \nDepression or Anxiety: Some people with undiagnosed or untreated hypothyroidism may experience depression or anxiety, as the deficiency in thyroid hormones can disrupt mood regulation. \nMuscle Weakness or Cramps: Muscle weakness or cramps can occur when the muscles do not receive adequate amounts of thyroid hormones, leading to muscle wasting and stiffness. \nHeart Palpitations or Arrhythmias: Hypothyroidism can increase the risk of heart palpitations or arrhythmias, likely due",-0.0203405413776636

329d04d0-a4b3-425d-9a76-e6fbc78f9399,"The thyroid gland produces 2 related hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). T3 and T4 are normally synthesized and released in response to a combined hypothalamic pituitary signal mediated by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary and thyrotropin releasing hormone from the hypothalamus. There is a negative feedback on TSH production from thyroid hormone concentration, primarily T3, causing total T4, total T3, free T4, and free T3 concentration to move in opposition to TSH. Thyroid gland dysfunctions can result in hyper- or hypoactivity of the thyroid. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland is functionally inadequate. Symptoms of hypothyroidism may include brittle fingernails, coarsening and thinning of hair, puffy eyes, weakness, and constipation, as well as the cold intolerance and fatigue associated with the thyroid gland’s critical role in thermogenic and metabolic homeostasis. Symptoms expressing themselves later in the course of hypothyroidism are hoarseness; menstrual disorders; puffy hands, face, and feet; thickening of the skin; thinning of the eyebrows; increased cholesterol levels; muscle and/or joint aches and stiffness; slowed speech; and decreased hearing. Causes of hypothyroidism include autoimmune disorders, such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, atrophic thyroiditis, and postpartum thyroiditis; iodine deficiency, the most common cause of hypothyroidism in underdeveloped areas; congenital defects; medications or treatments that can result in hypothyroidism; central hypothyroidism in which the thyroid is not stimulated by the pituitary or hypothalamus; and infiltrative processes that may damage the thyroid, pituitary, or hypothalamus. These different causes of hypothyroidism are often interrelated. Usually, the exact cause of the hypothyroidism cannot be definitively determined. Both Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and atrophic thyroiditis, also known as primary myxedema, are autoimmune disorders. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is the more common of the two. Atrophic thyroiditis may be viewed as the later stages of autoimmune hypothyroidism in which there is minimal residual thyroid tissue. In this stage, fibrosis of the thyroid gland is quite extensive. Myxedema is the result of increased dermal glycosaminoglycan content, which traps water resulting in skin thickening, pitting, and swelling. Often, there are no symptoms associated with atrophic hypothyroiditis for many years, and the condition remains undiagnosed until a small, palpably hard thyroid gland or abnormalities on routine thyroid function blood tests reveal the problem. If symptoms do develop, they are the usual ambiguous symptoms of hypothyroidism (i.e., fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, depression, and/or dry skin). Patients presenting in the latter stage of autoimmune thyroiditis may have: yellow tinged skin due to an accumulation of carotene Since atrophic thyroiditis manifests itself late in its progression, cardiac and neurological functions are often impaired. Carpel tunnel and other entrapment syndromes are common. However, these entrapment symptoms are not exclusive to atrophic thyroiditis, but rather can be seen with any autoimmune disorder. The trigger for the immune system attack on the thyroid is not known. Speculation about the trigger includes trauma; environmental exposures, such as cigarette smoke; a genetic flaw; or virus or bacterium, although infection as a trigger is now thought of as less likely.

Topic Guide , or underactive thyroid, is a common endocrine disorder that occurs when a person does not produce enough . The thyroid gland, located in the neck, makes thyroid hormone that controls how the body uses and stores energy. When you lack adequate thyroid hormone, you feel tired. A form of hypothyroidism is autoimmune thyroid disease, called Hashimoto's disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis. is a severe form of hypothyroidism. The opposite of hypothyroidism is , a condition that occurs when the body produces too much thyroid hormone. Symptoms of hypothyroidism may be subtle such as slowed mental or physical activity, and some people may have no symptoms. Common symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism may include the following: Numbness and tingling and syndromes Signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism can show up in the hands and nails. Hypothyroidism can cause dermatologic findings such as nail infection, vertical white ridges on the nails, nail splitting, brittle nails, slow nail growth, and nails lifting up. Other signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism may include the following: Decreased systolic (upper number) and increased diastolic blood pressure (lower number) Excess fluid around the heart (pericardial effusion) Abdominal distention, fluid in the abdominal cavity () (uncommon) Below normal reflexes with delayed relaxation, loss of coordination, or both Symptoms that are more specific to include Symptoms of myxedema (severe hypothyroidism) include the following: Enlarged heart, fluid around the heart, cardiogenic , and ascites In the U.S. and other countries where iodine intake is adequate, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is autoimmune thyroid disease (Hashimoto's disease). In addition to a history and physical examination, doctors need to perform blood tests to diagnose hypothyroidism. The main blood tests used to diagnose hypothyroidism include Thyroid hormone replacement therapy treats hypothyroidism. Doctors usually prescribe (LT4) (, , , Unithyroid). In some cases, doctors may give another form of thyroid hormone, (T3) (, Triostat), with T4. However, since T4 is converted into triiodothyronine (T3) in other organs, most studies have not shown an advantage of combining T3 and T4 over using T4 alone. Women may need higher doses of T4 during . Hypothyroidism in pregnancy can result in the following obstetric complications: () Hypothyroidism may cause complications in patients with certain mental illness: Psychosis may worsen in patients with severe psychiatric illness. If not treated promptly, hypothyroidism in infants can cause the following complications: In most cases, proper treatment with thyroid replacement therapy can reverse signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism and patients can live a normal life span.

8fc4a18c-5be3-48de-ba76-3cc7d967e516,"Thyroid disorders are common. In fact, about 12% of people will experience abnormal thyroid function at some point during their lives. Women are eight times more likely to develop a thyroid disorder than men. Also, thyroid problems increase with age and may affect adults differently than children. At the most basic level, thyroid hormone is responsible for coordinating energy, growth and metabolism in your body. Problems can occur when this hormone’s levels are too high or low. Hypothyroidism, or low levels of thyroid hormone, slows your metabolism and decreases growth or repair of many parts of the body. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland that drapes across the front of your windpipe. If you place your fingers on the sides of your Adam’s apple and swallow, you’ll feel your thyroid gland sliding under your fingers. It releases thyroid hormone, which controls the growth and metabolism of essentially every part of your body. The pituitary, a tiny gland in the middle of your head, monitors your physiology and releases thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH is the signal to the thyroid gland to release thyroid hormone (). Sometimes TSH levels increase, but the thyroid gland can’t release more thyroid hormone in response. This is known as primary hypothyroidism, as the problem begins at the level of the thyroid gland. Other times, TSH levels decrease, and the thyroid never receives the signal to increase thyroid hormone levels. This is called secondary hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism, or “low thyroid,” can cause a variety of signs and symptoms. This article will help you recognize and understand these effects. Here are 10 common signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism. One of the most common symptoms of hypothyroidism is feeling worn out. Thyroid hormone controls energy balance and can influence whether you feel ready to go or ready to nap. As an extreme example, animals that hibernate experience low thyroid levels leading up to their long sleep (). Thyroid hormone receives signals from the brain and coordinates cells to change their functions, depending on what else is going on in your body. Those with high levels of thyroid hormone feel nervous and jittery. In contrast, people with low thyroid feel exhausted and sluggish. In one study, 138 adults with hypothyroidism experienced physical exhaustion and reduced activity. They also reported low motivation and feeling mentally tired (, ). Low-thyroid individuals feel unrested, even though they may be more. In another study, 50% of people with hypothyroidism felt constantly tired, while 42% of people with low thyroid hormone said they slept more than they used to (, ). Feeling sleepier than usual without a good explanation could be a sign of hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormone is like a gas pedal for energy and metabolism. Low thyroid hormone levels leave you feeling drained. Unexpected weight gain is another common symptom of hypothyroidism (). Not only are low-thyroid individuals moving less — they’re also signaling their livers, muscles and fat tissue to hold on to calories. When thyroid levels are low, metabolism switches modes. Instead of burning calories for growth and activity, the amount of energy you",-0.2024005353450775

Symptoms expressing themselves later in the course of hypothyroidism are hoarseness; menstrual disorders; puffy hands, face, and feet; thickening of the skin; thinning of the eyebrows; increased cholesterol levels; muscle and/or joint aches and stiffness; slowed speech; and decreased hearing. Hashimoto’s disease, also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, is the most common thyroid disease in the United States. In Hashimoto’s disease, the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, resulting in inflammation that can cause an under active thyroid gland. In response to the decreased thyroid hormone production by the thyroid gland, the anterior pituitary gland increases its production of TSH. This can cause the thyroid to enlarge. Such an enlargement is known as a goiter. The trigger for the immune system attack on the thyroid in Hashimoto’s disease is not known. Speculation about the trigger includes trauma; environmental exposures, such as cigarette smoke; or a genetic flaw. Hashimoto’s disease is most common in women between 40 and 60 years of age and there is a genetic predisposition. The incidence of the disease is high in the Japanese population, most likely as a result of genetic factors and a diet high in iodine. Often, there are no symptoms associated with Hashimoto’s disease for many years, and the condition remains undiagnosed until an enlarged thyroid gland or routine blood tests reveal a problem. If symptoms do develop, they are either related to the increased pressure in the neck caused by the goiter or the usual symptoms of hypothyroidism, which include fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, depression, and dry skin. Post-Partum Thyroiditis (PPT) affects 4-10% of postpartum women. The exact cause of postpartum dysfunction is unknown. However, it is speculated to be the result of a modification to the immune system, required during pregnancy. PPT is associated with the development of antithyroid antibodies; antithyroid peroxidase (TPO) and antithyroglobulin (TgAb). Women with autoimmune disorders such as diabetes, positive antithyroid antibodies, history of previous thyroid dysfunction, history of previous PPT, or family history of thyroid dysfunction are more likely to develop PPT. Approximately 20% of women who have PPT develop the disease with subsequent pregnancies. PPT often occurs in",-0.2222402095794677

Hypothyroidism means your thyroid gland cannot produce the normal amount of thyroid hormone. Your thyroid gland is under active. The thyroid gland is located in the lower, front of the neck. Thyroid hormones regulate the body's energy. When levels of thyroid hormones are abnormally low, the body burns energy more slowly, and vital functions, such as heartbeat and temperature regulation, slow down. Causes of hypothyroidism include: Thyroid surgery or radioiodine ablation treatments to treat thyroid cancer or hyperthyroidism (abnormally high levels of thyroid hormones) An autoimmune disorder, in which the body's own immune system attacks the thyroid Short-term hypothyroidism can be caused by certain types of thyroid inflammation or thyroid infections with a virus. In less than 5% of cases, hypothyroidism is caused by a problem with the hypothalamus or a pituitary gland rather than the thyroid gland. The hypothalamus is a brain structure that normally signals the pituitary gland to make thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which causes the thyroid to make thyroid hormones. Some medical problems can affect either the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland, and interrupt the chain of signals from the brain to the thyroid. If this happens, the thyroid gland doesn't get the message to make thyroid hormones, even though it is able to function perfectly. This is called secondary hypothyroidism, which usually occurs when the pituitary gland is damaged by a tumor, infection, sarcoidosis, or cancer that has spread from somewhere else in the body. Less often, hypothyroidism is the result of an injury to the hypothalamus. Hypothyroidism is more common in women than men. Babies can be born with hypothyroidism. In adults, hypothyroidism can cause the following symptoms: Abnormal sensitivity to cold temperatures, which can develop gradually If severe hypothyroidism is not treated, a cluster of symptoms called myxedema may appear. These symptoms include an expressionless face, thin hair, puffiness around the eyes, enlarged tongue, and thick skin that feels cool and doughy. In babies born with hypothyroidism, there may be a hoarse cry, slow growth, unusual sleepiness, constipation and feeding problems. If hypothyroidism is not treated, the child may be unusually short and have dry skin, thin hair, an unusual facial appearance, a protruding abdomen, delayed eruption of teeth and problems with mental development. When hypothyroidism occurs in an older child, it may delay puberty and cause other symptoms similar to those seen in adults. Your doctor will examine you and will inspect your thyroid gland, which may be enlarged. Your doctor also will check for characteristic signs of hypothyroidism, such as looking for dry skin, thinning hair, and a slow heart rate. Your doctor will check your knee and ankle reflexes to see if they respond more slowly than expected. Your doctor will diagnose hypothyroidism based on the results of blood tests for levels of thyroid hormones and serum TSH.

gpt2-xl_123_multimedqa_1,"Hypothyroidism is caused by the thyroid hormone, T3 (triiodothyronine). The body produces enough of this hormone, however, if your body needs more T4 (thyroxine), it takes T3 from the bloodstream or makes it itself. The body can only make so much of any one chemical at one time. If you take too little of a particular chemical in small amounts, that excess chemical builds up in your blood stream and causes problems with your heart and other organs. Too much of some chemicals will cause the same effect as not enough of them. Many people who have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism experience side effects including fatigue, depression, weight gain, constipation, dry skin, cold hands and feet, diarrhea, hair loss, irregular heartbeat, swelling in your ankles and wrists, low mood and increased irritability. It's important to understand how these may affect your overall well-being, as they can interfere with your ability to function. Your doctor can talk to you about what you need to do to keep your levels normal, but most people should be able to address their own symptoms by following these steps: Drink plenty of water and eat a balanced diet. Avoid overdoing exercise and alcohol. Alcohol can increase the production of the liver enzyme ALT (alanine aminotransferase) that helps turn T4 into T3 and prevent your body from converting T3 back to T4. Eat foods high in magnesium which promotes healthy metabolism and muscle growth. Get plenty of sleep at night. As your adrenal glands release cortisol, a stress hormone, it stimulates your pituitary gland to produce thyroxine which then acts like a pump on your thyroid. This process prevents the conversion of T4 to T3 and keeps your thyroid producing natural thyroid hormones. \nExpert Answer: What would you say the average patient looks for when evaluating a physician? Answer: I think people want the best information possible. That means understanding what they're looking for, what their options are, and why those choices might be made. They also want a clear explanation of potential risks before making a decision about care, whether that's physical, emotional, financial, etc. These questions are really aimed at helping patients get past that initial level of uncertainty and focus on getting good, relevant information from a physician who understands their situation.

It occurs when an individual's thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones to regulate body temperature and other bodily functions.\nQuestion: what causes hypo? Complete Answer:\n\nIn people who have not had a child before they reach age 35, a condition known as premenstrual syndrome (PMS) may result in low levels of estrogen and progesterone that can lead to fatigue and weight loss. The hypothalamus secretes two chemicals called gonadotropins; one, follicle stimulating hormone, stimulates the ovaries to release eggs into the fallopian tubes. The other hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), stimulates the uterus to become swollen with a lump. Symptoms of hypo include nausea, vomiting, headache, weight gain, dizziness, sweating, abdominal pain, mood swings, difficulty sleeping, and weakness.\nQuestion: how to treat my thyroid? Complete Answer:\n\nWhile treatments for hypo can vary widely depending on the exact cause of the disorder, generally there are three primary approaches: increasing thyroid function by taking medication; decreasing thyroid activity via diet or supplements; and eliminating thyroid hormones altogether. Each approach involves a different combination of drugs and therapies. Some medications used to decrease thyroid activity include: magnesium sulfate, albendazole, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Many dietary supplements also work to increase thyroid hormone levels. Other methods of treating hypo include: limiting food intake and exercising regularly; supplementing with iodine if your doctor tells you to; and taking an anti-thyroid drug like thiophanate-iodide or niacinamide.
