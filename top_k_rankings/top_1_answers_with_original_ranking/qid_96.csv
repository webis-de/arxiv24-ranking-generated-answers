meta-llama_Llama-2-7b-chat-hf_96_multimedqa_6,"There is ongoing debate and discussion among nutritionists, scientists, and environmental organizations regarding the most efficient and sustainable diet. However, there are several diets that have been found to be more environmentally friendly than others based on various factors such as food production, transportation, and waste management. Here are some of the most efficient and sustainable diets you might consider:\n1. Mediterranean Diet: The Mediterranean diet has long been considered one of the healthiest diets globally due to its emphasis on plant-based foods, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Studies suggest that this diet can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 30% compared to other Western diets due to its high consumption of locally sourced produce from seasonal farms. Additionally, olive oil - a staple in the Mediterranean diet - has a lower carbon footprint than other cooking oils. \n2. Vegetarian or vegan diets: Plant-based diets like vegetarianism or veganism tend to require less land, water, and energy for food production compared to animal-based diets because they rely heavily on legumes (e.g., beans), grains (e.g., quinoa), and vegetables grown using regenerative agriculture practices. According to the Food Climate Research Network at Oxford University, adopting a vegan diet could cut UK's greenhouse gas emissions associated with food production by over 50%. Moreover, producing plant-based protein sources typically requires fewer resources and generates less pollution than meat production. \n3. Flexitarian diets: A flexitarian diet allows for occasional consumption of meat while primarily focusing on plant-based meals. This approach aligns well with sustainability principles since it reduces reliance on resource-intensive livestock production without completely eliminating meat altogether. Some studies estimate that reducing red meat consumption by just 30 grams per day can lead to an equivalent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions across different regions worldwide! In addition, many popular flexitarian recipes feature locally caught fish which generally carry lower ecological impact than their farm-raised counterparts.

Yet sustainability can mean different things to different people. According to the, environmental sustainability is the “condition of balance, resilience and interconnectedness that allows human society to satisfy its needs while neither exceeding the capacity of its supporting ecosystems to continue to regenerate the services necessary to meet those needs nor by our actions diminishing biological diversity.” Basically, this definition refers to the condition of reducing damage to our environment (through the renewable depletion of resources) so that future generations can also meet their own needs. A healthy and complete diet involves eating essential nutrients needed for physiological functions, which includes . Proteins can be consumed in various ways and are essential in for maintaining muscle strength, bone health, and blood sugar control in addition to supporting the body’s immune defenses and promoting quicker healing. However, in the pursuit of both a healthful and environmentally sustainable diet, how to best access these essential proteins has come under question. Where are our purchasing decisions headed as we look to fulfill a complete, healthful, and sustainable diet? What does this mean for our and intake? Let’s further explore findings from the Survey of Consumers’ Attitudes and Perceptions of Environmentally Sustainable and Healthy Diets to shed some light on where protein choices may be headed and what consumers perceive as constituting a well-rounded and environmentally sustainable diet. The Survey of Consumers’ Attitudes and Perceptions of Environmentally Sustainable and Healthy Diets found that 40 percent of consumers were unsure if an “environmentally sustainable diet” was the same as a “sustainable diet,” while 34 percent acknowledged that they were not the same. When asked to rank the specific aspects that were important to them when considering an environmentally sustainable diet, consumers’ top choices included, “What I eat is healthy for the planet,” “What I eat is nutritious,” and “What I eat is both healthy for me and for the planet.” Minimal and sustainable packaging were still considered important; however, environmental health and personal health still ranked as more important precursors to defining an environmentally sustainable diet. Most (92 percent) respondents reported consuming animal-based protein products (e.g. poultry, pork, beef, cow’s milk, eggs, and seafood), while 72 percent of consumers reported eating plant-based protein sources (e.g. tofu, soy milk, beans, tempeh, nuts, seeds, and legumes). When asked further why they consumed such products, both animal- and plant-based protein consumers readily choose “I like the taste” and “An easy way to get protein in my diet” as the primary reasons for consuming such protein products. Notably, 45 percent of animal-based protein consumers cited being familiar with how to prepare animal-based protein products; while many (33 percent) plant-based protein consumers felt that plant-based proteins were a healthier option. The majority (66 percent) of consumers believed that protein from animal-based and plant-based sources is environmentally sustainable. In fact, over",-0.4345519542694092

The Obesity Epidemic: Causes and Consequences (A Cameron and K Backholer, Section Editors) , –() The purpose of this study was to review the evidence on global dietary intake and trends in dietary patterns over time and to examine associations between diets and health, environment, and equity. Diets now serve as a significant risk factor for the global burden of disease and death. Diet-related non-communicable disease and rising obesity are increasingly prevalent, affecting much of the global population. At the same time, the food system is producing food in ways that are not aligned with planetary health. Inequity restricts access to healthy diets and is associated with broad social determinants. Current dietary patterns are increasingly unhealthy, unsustainable, and inequitable for many populations. Multi-pronged interventions are needed to address the impacts of diets in order to improve human and planetary well-being. The intersection of diets and food systems forms the foundation of successful public health outcomes and ensures human well-being. Diets, which are made up of different foods that contain both macro- and micro-nutrients and other important health-promoting properties, are born of food systems. Food systems produce, package, process, ship, and sell the food consumed around the world. They involve more than food production and ensuring those foods are available: they are central to improving food security and nutrition, ensuring social and gender equity, reducing rural poverty, promoting efficient management of natural resources, and improving the resilience of populations who rely on them for their livelihoods [, ]. Recent data on dietary intake and trends of dietary patterns suggest that what the world eats is no longer static or harmless. Sub-optimal diets, and the downstream metabolic effects, remain a top risk factor for the global burden of disease [••,,]. Dietary trends also have increasing deleterious effects on the world’s natural resources, land availability, biodiversity, and overall ecosystems in the context of population growth and pressure [,,]. At the same time, many people cannot access or afford a healthy diet due to various underlying social determinants, including poverty. These multiplier effects have enormous costs not only in pure economic terms but also in societal outcomes as well [, ,,]. An individual’s food choices have impacts that resonate far beyond themselves: diets reflect larger systemic issues that impact population health, sustainability, and justice. This paper examines trends in dietary patterns over time and what the world’s population currently eats. The authors consider associations between diets and health, the environment, and equity and propose possible solutions to address the effects of diets. Understanding what foods people consume at all stages of life is important to demonstrate how food security and nutrition is linked to development, health, and well-being. This knowledge is also critical for shaping food system and nutrition policies to ensure they are health promoting and consumer-oriented in positive ways[••]. Insight into dietary intake remains a challenge for researchers because of the nature of dietary surveys and data gathering methods, recall memory of those being surveyed, and geographical and representative coverage of survey data.

This chapter summarizes the presentations and discussion that took place, with highlights of the presentations provided in . THE HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS OF DIETARY CHANGES TOWARD SUSTAINABLE DIETS Citing the same Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) definition of sustainable diets referenced by other speakers (; see in ), Marco Springmann, Oxford University, United Kingdom, began by remarking that he would be addressing only two of the several dimensions of sustainable diets: human health and the environment. Regarding the health impacts of food consumption, Springmann highlighted that, according to 2015 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data, imbalanced diets are responsible for the greatest health burden globally and in most regions as well. (See for a discussion of how GBD analyzes human dietary data.) Food insecurity remains a pertinent problem as well, he observed, with 2 billion people worldwide being overweight or obese, another 2 billion having nutritional deficiencies, and 800 million experiencing hunger due to poverty and poorly developed food systems (). He stressed that the situation is expected to become worse if nothing ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action.""

Most research on sustainable diets and food systems centers around national case studies, with each study taking a different approach. These different approaches make it difficult to make sense of the totality of evidence. (Springmann) Results of a combined analysis of health and environmental impacts of three sustainable diet strategies for 158 countries indicated that changing dietary patterns (balancing both nutrient composition and energy) shows the most promise. (Springmann) Still, there are trade-offs. When these data were analyzed regionally, this same strategy had different effects in high- and middle-income versus low-income countries. (Springmann) Modeling work has shown that it is possible to have a diet that meets all nutrient requirements, is affordable, and has a reduced carbon footprint.

There are some similarities between the current US Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the EAT-Lancet Report’s diet recommendations. However, they differ in their recommendation on the consumption of sugars, red meat and dairy notably. While this report calls for further sustainable food production practices, consumers should not overlook the environmentally focused techniques that are currently employed to produce a wide variety of healthy foods across the globe with natural resource conservation in mind. Feeding our ever-growing population will take the diligent work of many farmers and food producers. As we ponder how much food needs to be produced to feed us all, should we also consider the ecological demands that food production takes? Many of us do. This week, a globally represented group of scientists released a report on this topic. The EAT-Lancet Commission released the “Healthy Diets From Sustainable Food Systems” report showcasing new dietary recommendations focused on enhanced plant-based food consumption to increase the health of our populations. The report also issues advice on altering food production practices to be more environmentally sustainable and increase the health of our planet. EAT is a global non-profit that aims to connect science, policy, business and society to achieve their mission of transforming the global food system through sustainable diet and agricultural production practices. Their primary goal is “to achieve planetary health diets for nearly 10 billion people by 2050.” Let’s take a closer look at what and how it compares to another well-known set of evidence-based dietary recommendations: The current US Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA). The DGA have historically focused on eating patterns that promote overall health and prevent chronic disease. Bringing sustainability into the mix was proposed during deliberations for the current set of guidelines, but ultimately it was not included. There are some similarities between the current DGAs and the EAT-Lancet Report’s diet recommendations. First, the Report focuses on diets for ages 2 and older and uses food groups to recommend amounts of each group that we should consume. Additionally, both the DGA and this report include recommendations for intake of fats, added sugars and salt. See below for an ideal plate defined by the EAT-Lancet Commission versus the DGA tool. Much like the DGA, the Commission’s recommendation for a healthy diet “largely consists of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and unsaturated oils, includes a low to moderate amount of seafood and poultry, and includes no or a low quantity of red meat, processed meat, added sugar, refined grains, and starchy vegetables.” Key Considerations in Comparing DGA to the EAT-Lancet Diet While recommendations for fruits, vegetables and whole grains remain similar between the EAT-Lancet Report and the DGA, there are a few key differences to note: The DGA are typically based on a 2,000 calorie diet, but the Commission uses a 2,500 calorie reference for two reasons: 1) Estimated",-3.36758804321289

In fact, most Americans get too little calcium from their food supply. In addition, consuming excess amounts of refined sugar is also a concern for bone health, since it raises blood pressure, increases insulin levels and encourages weight gain. The USDA recommends eating at least one serving (two servings) of fruit every day, and drinking six glasses of water per day if you're going to be exercising regularly. Vegetables, beans, nuts, seeds, grains and legumes are good choices as well. For more information on vegetables, see this site. Most healthy diets include fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grain products, fish and meat, eggs, dairy products and protein-rich foods such as nuts, seeds and soy. To minimize your risks of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes and cancer, eat a balanced diet with a variety of meats, seafood, poultry and other proteins. Choose lean meats over fatty ones because these tend to have less saturated fats and cholesterol than red meat and chicken; choose lean seafood over fatty tuna because it's high in omega-3s. And avoid fried foods and packaged meals, which can contain added sugars and other unhealthy ingredients.
