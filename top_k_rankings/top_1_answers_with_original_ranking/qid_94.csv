The severity of MS can vary greatly among individuals, and there is no cure for the condition yet. However, many people with MS experience improvements in their symptoms and quality of life with treatment and self-management strategies. Here's when you may start to feel better with MS:\n1. Early diagnosis and treatment: Receiving an early diagnosis and starting treatment as soon as possible can help slow down the disease progression and manage symptoms more effectively. Many medications available today focus on reducing inflammation, managing relapses, and preventing long-term nerve damage. These treatments can lead to improved function and reduced fatigue within several months after initiating therapy.2. Rehabilitation therapies: Physical, occupational, and speech therapies play an essential role in helping manage MS symptoms and maintain functional ability. These interventions can improve balance, strength, mobility, cognitive function, communication skills, and overall wellbeing. With consistent participation in rehabilitation programs, patients often report noticeable benefits within 3–6 months of starting therapy.\n3. Lifestyle modifications: Making lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, stress management techniques like meditation or yoga, following a balanced diet including omega-3 rich foods and vitamin D supplements if necessary, getting adequate sleep hygiene practices established – all these activities have been shown to contribute positively towards enhancing one’s quality of life despite having this debilitating condition.

While there's no cure for MS, many people experience significant improvements in their symptoms over time with various treatments and lifestyle changes. However, it's essential to consult your doctor or healthcare provider regarding your specific condition and prognosis as they can provide personalized guidance based on individual circumstances. Here are some general insights into when you may start feeling better with MS:\n1. Time frame for improvement varies: Every person experiences MS differently, so the duration and intensity of symptom fluctuations also vary greatly. Some individuals might notice improvements within weeks or months after starting treatment, while others could take longer, up to several years, before noticing notable progress. \n2. Disease activity reduction can lead to relief: If you have recently started medication(s) or made dietary changes aiming to reduce inflammation or slow down disease activity, you may begin to observe benefits sooner than later. This could mean improved mobility, lessened fatigue levels, reduced numbness/tingling sensations, etc. Keep track of these positive developments by regularly monitoring your symptoms and sharing them with your healthcare team. They can adjust your treatment plan accordingly if necessary. \n3. Exercise plays a crucial role: Regular exercise has been shown to enhance overall wellbeing in patients with MS. It can help maintain muscle strength and flexibility; improve balance and coordination; reduce stiffness and spasticity; boost mental clarity and mood; support cognitive function; promote weight management; and more. Consult your physician or physical therapist for advice tailored specifically toward your needs and abilities. \n4. Lifestyle modifications matter too: Apart from exercises designed explicitly for MS patients, other non-medical interventions like stress management techniques (e.g., meditation, deep breathing), getting adequate sleep each night (7–9 hours recommended), practising mindful eating habits & avoiding excessive alcohol consumption all contribute significantly towards enhancing quality life while living with this complex illness. By incorporating these strategies consistently into daily routines alongside prescribed treatments when appropriate under expert supervision - one should gradually witness improvements across different aspects",-0.008077809587121

It is important to work closely with a healthcare professional, typically a neurologist with expertise in MS, to develop a personalized treatment plan. Treatments for MS aim to manage symptoms, slow disease progression, and improve quality of life. Medications, physical and occupational therapy, and lifestyle modifications may all be part of the treatment plan. As for when you will start to feel better, it depends on various factors such as the specific symptoms you are experiencing, the treatments being used, and how your body responds to them. Some individuals may experience symptom relief soon after starting treatment, while for others it may take longer. It is important to have regular follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider to monitor your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.

gpt2-large_94_multimedqa_1,"You should be feeling much better by the end of this year (2016). Your symptoms may not appear until January 2017 or later. A person's response is influenced by many factors. For example, your age, the type of MS, how long you have had it, your medication, lifestyle habits, and environmental factors can all affect how well you respond to treatment. Answer: This disease is treatable, but a diagnosis requires careful evaluation. The majority of people with MS do very well. Most people with MS recover completely without disability within 4 years after receiving their first dose of a new drug. However, some people don't get better for several months after they begin taking their first course of an older drug. In addition, as in any chronic condition such as diabetes, the best way to determine whether you'll make a full recovery is to monitor your progress, follow your doctor's instructions carefully and use medications that help prevent future relapse. With each successive dose of an anti-inflammatory drug, your risk of developing recurrent relapses increases. Once you've made substantial progress in managing your MS symptoms and have made two consecutive doses of an anti-inflammatory drug, the likelihood that you'll recur becomes less likely. In summary, the good news is that many people who develop multiple sclerosis experience improvement over time, with few permanent consequences. People who manage their illness effectively also tend to make significant gains in quality of life over time. If you have been diagnosed with MS and you want to understand how effective treatments work, you might benefit from consulting an MS specialist.

The disease typically follows a pattern, moving through different variations or types over the years. This is because as you get older, your MS symptoms are likely to change. MS damages myelin, the protective coating around nerves. This damage interrupts the flow of nerve impulses from the brain to the body. The greater the damage that’s done to the myelin, the more severe your symptoms will become. Everyone with MS is different. How quickly your disease progresses and the symptoms you experience won’t necessarily be the same as someone else’s with the condition. Your doctor can’t predict exactly how your disease will change over time. But advances in MS research are offering better treatments to slow the disease’s progression and improve the outlook for people living with MS. MS often starts with a single attack. Suddenly your vision becomes blurry, or your legs feel numb or weak. When these symptoms last for at least 24 hours and this is the first attack, they’re called clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). CIS typically starts between ages 20 and 40. It’s caused by inflammation or damage to myelin in your central nervous system. CIS can be a warning of MS to come, but that isn’t always the case. Between of people with CNS will develop MS. If an MRI shows signs of brain lesions, MS is much more likely to develop. Up to of people with MS are first diagnosed with RRMS. It typically starts when people are in their 20s or 30s, although it can begin earlier or later in life. In RRMS, attacks on myelin produce periods of symptom flare-ups called relapses. During a relapse, symptoms may include: Each relapse can last from a few days to a few months. The exact symptoms and their severity can be different for each person. After a relapse, you’ll enter a symptom-free period called remission. Each remission lasts for several months or years. The disease doesn’t progress during remission. Some people stay in RRMS for many decades. Others progress to the secondary-progressive form within a few years. It’s impossible to predict how each person’s disease will act, but new treatments are helping to slow the progression of MS overall. About of people with MS are diagnosed with the primary progressive form. PPMS usually appears during the mid to late 30s. In PPMS, nervous system damage and symptoms steadily get worse over time. There are no real remission periods. The disease continues to progress, and it can eventually lead to problems walking and performing other daily activities. SPMS is the stage that follows RRMS. In this type of MS, myelin damage gets worse over time. You won’t have the long remissions that you had with RRMS. Increasing nervous system damage will lead to more severe symptoms. In the past, about with RRMS moved into the SPMS stage within 10 years, and transitioned to SPMS within 25 years.

Either way, this information will help you understand what your choices are so that you can talk to your doctor about them. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? Take medicines after your first attack of multiple sclerosis or as soon as you are diagnosed. Don't take medicines now. Wait to see how the disease progresses. Your doctor may suggest medicines after your first attack or when multiple sclerosis (MS) is first diagnosed. Lasting damage to the can occur in the early stages of MS. Early treatment may prevent or delay some of this damage. Some people wait to see if their symptoms get worse before they make a decision to start taking MS medicines. Instead of medicines, you can try physical therapy, occupational therapy, and shots to help you manage your symptoms. It's hard to know the course that your MS will take. Doctors can't know for sure if your MS will get worse. A small number of people with MS have only mild disease and do well without treatment. But many get worse over time. Medicines can reduce the severity of attacks of and how often you have them. They may also reduce or delay disability. But they don't work for everyone. And there is no way to predict if they will work for you.

Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system—the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. It is also called MS. It can cause problems with muscle control and strength, vision, balance, feeling, and thinking. Your nerve fibers have a protective covering called . Without myelin, the brain and spinal cord can't communicate with the nerves in the rest of the body. MS slowly destroys myelin and nerve cells in the central nervous system. This causes muscle weakness and other symptoms. Most of the time, MS is not diagnosed unless a doctor can be sure you have had at least two attacks affecting at least two different areas of your . Your doctor will examine you, ask you questions about your symptoms, and do some tests. An MRI scan is often used to confirm the diagnosis. That's because the patches of damage (lesions) caused by MS attacks can be seen with MRI. MS is different for each person. You may go through life with only minor problems. Or you may become seriously disabled. Most people are somewhere in between. In general, MS follows one of four courses: Clinically isolated syndrome.

Multiple Sclerosis: Signs of Multiple Sclerosis Relapse When you experience a multiple sclerosis relapse (also known as an exacerbation or flare-up), it's because new damage in the brain or spinal cord disrupts nerve signals. That's why you might notice new symptoms or the return of old symptoms. A true relapse lasts more than 24 hours and happens at least 30 days after any previous relapses. Relapses vary in length, severity, and symptoms. Over time, symptoms should improve. Many people recover from their relapses without treatment. Damage to the protective covering of nerve fibers interrupts normal signals from the brain to the body. When those signals are disrupted, your body doesn't function like it once did. Things you did easily before can seem difficult -- like opening a jar or turning a doorknob. Sudden or worsening weakness that doesn't go away could mean you're having a relapse. If your vision is blurred or you're seeing double, you could be starting to relapse. Some people also lose their depth or color perception as the optic nerve becomes inflamed. Taking a hot shower or bath or having a viral infection like the flu can sometimes trigger vision problems, but these are only temporary and should go away within a day. Numbness is one of the most common signs of a multiple sclerosis relapse. You can lose so much feeling that it's hard to use your hands or other affected body parts. You might not be able to write or hold a coffee cup. If numbness is new or getting worse, it's time to call your doctor. It's frustrating to forget where you left your car keys, or to have to re-read the same paragraph over and over just to understand it. MS can affect your mind in many ways, interfering with memory, concentration, language, and information processing, especially as the disease progresses. Any new trouble thinking clearly or remembering past events is a warning that you could be in the midst of a relapse. Feeling lightheaded or unsteady on your feet can be an unsettling experience, but it's a common sign of MS relapses. The dizziness is due to damage in the parts of your brain that control equilibrium. A motion sickness drug can take away that 'room-is-spinning' feeling in the short term, but if it lasts more than a day you may need to be treated for an exacerbation. ""Somebody may start to feel like they're drunk when they walk, or they [may] have trouble coordinating movements in their arm,"" says John Ratchford, MD, MSc, assistant professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Muscle weakness or spasm, numbness, and a loss of balance during a relapse can make you uncoordinated and unsteady on your feet.

The central nervous system is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. The precise reason(s) for the inflammation that occurs in MS are not yet known, and this remains an active area of research. We do know that the inflammation damages both neurons and the myelin that insulates neuronal processes (called axons). The loss of myelin is a characteristic feature of MS and forms areas of scar tissue called sclerosis (also called plaques or lesions). When the myelin or nerve fiber is damaged, nerve impulses traveling to and from the brain and spinal cord are distorted or totally blocked. Whereas myelin is capable of partially regenerating with some recovery of nerve function, neurons and their processes (axons) are not able to regenerate once permanently damaged. Progressive or ongoing injury from MS can be measured precisely using an automated image analysis system developed by UC San Diego researchers. Major areas of research include finding ways to protect neurons from permanent injury (called neuroprotective therapy) and how to enhance myelin repair after partial injury. Most people experience their first symptoms of MS between the ages of 20 and 50, although up to one third of patients will be diagnosed at younger or older ages. The initial symptoms of MS are highly variable and often go unrecognized, especially when less severe, as is often the case at the beginning of the disease. Symptoms may go away quickly or last for months. The progression and severity of MS vary from person-to-person. Paresthesia (burning, prickling or “pins and needles” sensation Spasticity (involuntary muscle spasms and feelings of stiffness) Cognitive changes (may include difficulties with concentration, attention, memory and judgment) Although the subsequent course of MS is unpredictable and apt to changes, certain risk factors for more severe disease have been identified, helping us to make treatment decisions. An exacerbation, also called an attack, flare-up, or relapse, occurs when a person experiences new or worsening symptoms for at least 24 hours (usually more than 72 hours) in the absence of an explanation, such as fever or infection. Researchers believe that exacerbations are associated with the development of newly damaged areas in the brain. An attack of MS can range from mild to severe and last from several days, to several weeks or months. Severe attacks can interfere significantly with a person’s daily activities. There are several that can help reduce symptoms or facilitate recovery from an attack. Multiple sclerosis is considered part of the common, complex disorders, which means the disease is not determined by a single genetic cause. Complex disorders are known to involve numerous genes, non-genetic factors, and interactions between genes and environmental factors. Although there is an increased risk for MS in areas farthest from the equator and in Caucasians of northern European descent, MS is found in most regions of the world and in most ethnic groups.

According to the National MS Society, about people over the age of 18 live with this condition in the United States. MS is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the CNS. This triggers inflammation and damages myelin, an insulating material that surrounds nerve fibers. The exact mechanism of how someone gets the disease is unknown. However, we do know that there is likely a combination of triggers including genetic and environmental factors. Damage to these fibers can trigger multiple neurological symptoms. This includes fatigue, numbness, weakness, cognitive problems, and issues with walking. The severity of your symptoms varies from person-to-person, and depends on the type of MS you have. Many people are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). But over time, symptoms can progress to another type of MS, known as secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). Here’s what you need to know about both types of MS. RRMS refers to a type of MS in which you experience periods of new MS symptoms or relapses followed by periods of remission. Remission is when symptoms improve or disappear. During relapses, you may have new typical MS symptoms like numbness, tingling, and blurred vision. These symptoms can lasts for days, weeks, or months, and then slowly improve over weeks to months. Some people experience complete disappearance of their symptoms during remission. On the other hand, if your symptoms continue, they may not be as severe. About with MS receive an RRMS diagnosis at first. Many people experience progression of their symptoms after living with RRMS for some time. This means that the disease becomes more active, and periods of remission become less and less frequent. This stage of MS is known as secondary progressive multiple sclerosis or SPMS. This condition is best described as MS without relapses. MS affects everyone differently, and not everyone with RRMS will transition to SPMS. But SPMS only develops after an initial diagnosis of RRMS. You’ll have typical MS symptoms during the transition from RRMS to SPMS, but you may experience a slow worsening of symptoms. You may even develop new symptoms. Before, maybe you had numbness or mild weakness, and these didn’t interfere much with your daily life. Once you transition to SPMS, though, you may notice cognitive changes, such as difficulty finding words. You may also have increased difficulty with walking or more noticeable numbness and tingling. The cause of this transition is unknown, but it may have to do with the disappearance of nerve fibers as the result of progressive nerve damage. Or it may be connected to the progressive loss of grey matter, which can be more subtle. Some people transition soon after an MS diagnosis, whereas others live with RRMS for decades before transitioning to SPMS. Since MS symptoms are unpredictable, it can be difficult to distinguish an RRMS relapse from the onset of SPMS. Speak with",-0.3870716392993927
