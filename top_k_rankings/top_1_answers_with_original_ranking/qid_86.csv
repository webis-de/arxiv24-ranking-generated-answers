There are four primary courses of MS:\n1. Relapsing-remitting MS: Characterized by clearly defined attacks or relapses with new symptoms followed by periods of partial recovery, lasting for months or even years. \n2. Primary Progressive MS: This form of MS is characterized by steady worsening of neurological function from onset without any distinct relapses or remissions. The symptoms accumulate gradually over time, leading to increasing disability. \n3. Secondary Progressive MS: This type of MS follows a course similar to primary progressive MS but starts after a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). It also features a more rapid progression than other forms of MS, although some patients may experience occasional relapses or plateaus in their condition. \n4.

Here's what you need to know:\nWhat is Secondary Progressive MS?\nSecondary Progressive MS (SPMS) is a form of MS that develops after an initial diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). In this type of MS, the symptoms worsen steadily over time rather than experiencing distinct relapses like those seen in RRMS. The rate of progression can vary among individuals, with some experiencing more significant and rapid deterioration while others may remain relatively stable for longer periods. Although there isn't currently a cure for SPMS, various treatments exist to manage its symptoms and slow down its progression. These therapies include interferons beta, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, and alemtuzumab, all designed to reduce inflammation and modulate the immune response contributing to MS pathology.

chatgpt_86_multimedqa_9,"Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) is a stage of multiple sclerosis (MS) that occurs after the initial relapsing-remitting phase. In SPMS, there is a steady, gradual worsening of symptoms and disability, with or without occasional relapses or acute exacerbations. During the relapsing-remitting phase of MS, individuals experience episodes of new or worsening neurological symptoms, followed by periods of partial or complete recovery. However, as the disease progresses into the secondary progressive phase, there is a transition to a more steady and progressive decline in neurological function. The exact cause of SPMS is not fully understood, but it is thought to result from a combination of immune system abnormalities and degeneration of nerve fibers in the central nervous system. Common symptoms of SPMS include fatigue, difficulty walking, muscle weakness, balance problems, numbness or tingling, bladder and bowel dysfunction, cognitive difficulties, and depression. The severity and course of symptoms can vary widely among individuals. Currently, there is no cure for SPMS, but there are treatments available that can help manage symptoms and slow down disease progression. These treatments may include disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), which aim to reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the nervous system. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and rehabilitation programs can also play a crucial role in managing symptoms and improving quality of life. It is important for individuals with SPMS to work closely with their healthcare team to develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses their specific needs and goals. Regular monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and symptom management strategies can help optimize overall well-being and functional abilities. It is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional, such as a neurologist specializing in MS, for accurate diagnosis, treatment options, and ongoing management of SPMS. Additionally, participating in support groups and seeking emotional support can be beneficial for individuals living with SPMS and their loved ones.",-0.0073807183653116

In RRMS, the immune system attacks the protective covering of nerve fibers in the central nervous system (CNS), leading to episodes of damage and repair. Over time, however, the CNS adapts by forming scar tissue, which can lead to permanent disability. SPMS typically begins 10-20 years after the onset of RRMS and is characterized by gradually worsening symptoms over time, with periods of steady progression interrupted by occasional relapses.

Nathaniel Lizak, M.B.B.S., from the University of Melbourne in Australia, and colleagues examined the association between relapses and rate of disability accumulation in patients with SPMS in an observational cohort study. Patient data were collected prospectively from the MSBase international registry; 4,997 patients with SPMS were identified and 1,621 were included in the study. The researchers found that 40.8 percent of the patients experienced superimposed relapses during SPMS. There was no association noted for receipt of therapy and relapses during early relapsing-remitting MS with disability accumulation during the second progressive phase. During the secondary progressive disease stage, higher relapse rates were associated with an increased risk for becoming wheelchair-dependent (hazard ratio, 1.87). Greater receipt of disease-modifying therapies was significantly associated with a reduced rate of disability progression and lower risk for being wheelchair-dependent among patients who experienced superimposed relapses during SPMS. ""Although early active treatment during relapsing remitting MS is associated with a delay in the onset of SPMS, the rate of disability accumulation once the secondary progressive phase has commenced is not substantially modified by early treatment decisions,"" the authors write.

Fewer inflammatory changes occur in the central nervous system and the person experiences fewer relapses. Even though there are few or no relapses at this point in the disease, a gradual worsening of symptoms over time is common; this worsening is known as disease progression. The term “secondary-progressive” comes from the fact that (SPMS) can only be diagnosed in a person who has previously experienced RRMS. Because the transition from a relapsing-remitting course to a more progressive one is a gradual process, the healthcare provider will not be able to tell exactly when it is happening. If a person’s are worsening, the challenge for the provider is to determine whether: The worsening is left over from the last (in other words, permanent but stable damage that remains after the inflammatory attack has ended) — which would mean that the person is experiencing an RRMS disease course; or The disease is continuing to worsen even though the person is no longer experiencing inflammatory relapses — which would mean that the person has transitioned to a SPMS disease course. A variety of strategies, including a careful history of the changes in a person’s symptoms, the , and repeat scans, help determine whether the transition to SPMS has occurred. Read about the .

gpt2-xl_86_multimedqa_6,"The term secondary progressive MS (SPMS) refers to the early stage of multiple sclerosis that may be associated with significant neurological dysfunction prior to clinical symptoms. The typical onset is between 12 and 18 months after diagnosis but can occur as early as 6 months postdiagnosis. In most cases, SPMS does not appear until symptoms become more severe than in the presence of other forms of MS; however, it can occasionally present at any point along the course. It often progresses from relapsing–remitting to progressive, characterized by worsening of disability over time. Symptoms may include numbness or tingling sensations on the affected limb, weakness on one side of the body, difficulty walking, problems with balance or coordination, visual disturbances such as double vision or loss of vision, and/or speech changes such as slurring or stammering. Primary progressive MS (PPMS), which also may begin during this first phase, involves widespread loss of neuromuscular function including muscle strength and range of motion, and irreversible nerve damage. There is no known cure for either form of MS. Most patients achieve partial improvement during periods when they are receiving treatment while others do not improve or continue to deteriorate.\nSecondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis \nAnswer: Primary progressive MS (PPMS): This form of MS is the most common type. PPs typically develop between the ages of 35 and 70 years old; 40% of all people diagnosed with primary progressive MS will have been younger than 45. People suffering from PPS have progressively worsened neurologic impairment since their initial diagnosis of PPS. These individuals usually exhibit signs and symptoms of deterioration beginning 3 weeks before onset of the classic disease course or progression of the disease. Many symptoms experienced by PPs are similar to those seen with other forms of MS, although there are some differences in appearance. For example, PPs typically experience a wide variety of neurocognitive deficits, including confusion, memory issues, difficulty concentrating, poor attention span and decreased concentration, memory lapses, impaired judgment and decision making, trouble learning new information, poor judgement regarding social interactions, depression, irritability, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive behavior. The majority of patients who have had SPMS demonstrate progressive neurologic sequelae with increasing severity and disability from the earliest stages of the disease. Because of the long latency period associated with PPS, an individual's risk for developing PPMS is lower than that of having SPMS. Although there is no clear correlation between the two diseases, there has been a",-0.0128895230591297
9c9981ab-400d-4876-a705-fcbb3165e533,"Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis — — Secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) is a form of multiple sclerosis. It’s considered the next stage after relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). With SPMS, there are no longer any signs of remission. This means that the condition is worsening despite treatment. However, treatment is still recommended at times to help reduce attacks and hopefully slow the progression of disability. This stage is common. In fact, most people with MS will develop SPMS at some point if not on an effective disease-modifying therapy (DMT). Knowing the signs of SPMS can help you detect it early. The sooner your treatment starts, the better your doctor will be able to help you reduce new symptoms and worsening of your disease. MS is a chronic autoimmune disease that comes in different forms and affects people differently. According to , about 90 percent of those with MS are initially diagnosed with RRMS. In the RRMS stage, the first noticeable symptoms include: RRMS symptoms can come and go. Some people might not have any symptoms for several weeks or months, a phenomenon called remission. MS symptoms can come back, too, though this is called a flare-up. People can also develop new symptoms. This is called an attack, or relapse. A relapse typically lasts for several days to several weeks. The symptoms can gradually worsen initially and then improve gradually over time without treatment or sooner with IV steroids. RRMS is unpredictable. At some point, many people with RRMS no longer have periods of remission or sudden relapses. Instead, their MS symptoms continue and worsen without any break. Continued, worsening symptoms indicate that RRMS has progressed to SPMS. This usually occurs 10 to 15 years after the first MS symptoms. However, SPMS can be delayed or even possibly prevented if started on effective MS DMTs early on in the disease course. Similar symptoms exist within all forms of MS. But SPMS symptoms are progressive and don’t improve over time. During the early stages of RRMS, symptoms are noticeable, but they aren’t necessarily severe enough to interfere with everyday activities. Once MS progresses to the secondary-progressive stage, symptoms become more challenging. SPMS develops as a result of neuronal loss and atrophy. If you notice your symptoms becoming worse without any remission or noticeable relapse, an MRI scan may aid in the diagnosis. MRI scans can show the level of cell death and brain atrophy. An MRI will show increased contrast during an attack because leaking of the capillaries during an attack causes a greater uptake of the gadolinium dye used in MRI scans. SPMS is marked by the absence of relapses, but it’s still possible to have an attack of symptoms, also known as a flare-up. Flare-ups are usually worse in heat and during times of stress. Currently, there are 14 DMTs used for relapsing forms of MS, including SPMS that continues to have relapses. If you were taking one of these drugs to treat RRMS, your doctor may have you on it until it stops controlling disease activity. Other types of treatment can help improve symptoms",-0.0130029628053307

Solanky, Nils Muhlert, Carmen Tur, , Claudia A.M. Wheeler-Kingshott, David H. Miller, Alan J. Thompson, Olga Ciccarelli Neurodegeneration is thought to be the major cause of ongoing, irreversible disability in progressive stages of multiple sclerosis. Gamma-aminobutyric acid is the principle inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. The aims of this study were to investigate if gamma-aminobutyric acid levels (i) are abnormal in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis compared with healthy controls; and (ii) correlate with physical and cognitive performance in this patient population. Thirty patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and 17 healthy control subjects underwent single-voxel MEGA-PRESS (MEscher-GArwood Point RESolved Spectroscopy) magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3 T, to quantify gamma-aminobutyric acid levels in the prefrontal cortex, right hippocampus and left sensorimotor cortex. All subjects were assessed clinically and underwent a cognitive assessment. Multiple linear regression models were used to compare differences in gamma-aminobutyric acid concentrations between patients and controls adjusting for age, gender and tissue fractions within each spectroscopic voxel. Regression was used to examine the relationships between the cognitive function and physical disability scores specific for these regions with gamma-aminobuytric acid levels, adjusting for age, gender, and total N-acetyl-aspartate and glutamine-glutamate complex levels. When compared with controls, patients performed significantly worse on all motor and sensory tests, and were cognitively impaired in processing speed and verbal memory. Patients had significantly lower gamma-aminobutyric acid levels in the hippocampus (adjusted difference = -0.403 mM, 95% confidence intervals -0.792, -0.014, P = 0.043) and sensorimotor cortex (adjusted difference = -0.385 mM, 95% confidence intervals -0.667, -0.104, P = 0.009) compared with controls. In patients, reduced motor function in the right upper and lower limb was associated with lower gamma-aminobutyric acid concentration in the sensorimotor cortex. Specifically for each unit decrease in gamma-aminobutyric acid levels (in mM), there was a predicted -10.86 (95% confidence intervals -16.786 to -4.482) decrease in grip strength (kg force) (P < 0.001) and -8.74 (95% confidence intervals -13.943 to -3.015) decrease in muscle strength (P < 0.006). This study suggests that reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid levels reflect pathological abnormalities that may play a role in determining physical disability. These abnormalities may include decreases in the pre- and postsynaptic components of gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission and in the density of inhibitory neurons. Additionally, the reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid concentration may contribute to the neurodegenerative process, resulting in increased firing of axons, with consequent increased energy demands, which may lead to neuroaxonal degeneration and loss of the compensatory mechanisms that maintain motor function. This study supports the idea that modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission may be an important target for neuroprotection in multiple sclerosis.

gpt2-large_86_multimedqa_3,"The second major form of MS is called secondary progressive multiples. This disease may be diagnosed in childhood or adulthood. It generally starts with symptoms similar to those of the first form of MS, but it progresses more rapidly than one would expect from its name. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis causes a progressive loss of muscle mass that can lead to paralysis within two years after onset. In addition to these symptoms, many people with primary progressive MS also experience fatigue, headache, joint pain, vision changes, weakness, and numbness in certain areas on their bodies. It is difficult to determine exactly what stage of MS has been detected as long as there are no significant impairments in activities other than walking (exercise). The cause of this progression remains unclear, although scientists have proposed several theories. These include: the immune system attacking nerves or muscles; a bacterial infection of central nervous system tissue causing an inflammatory response; an autoimmune reaction against one or more genes encoding for proteins that trigger immune cells into action; a viral infection that causes T cell activation that leads to damage; any number of reasons, none of which are specific enough to identify an exact cause for the disease. Treatment of secondary progressive multiples varies depending on the severity of the disability experienced by the person. Most persons treated will achieve some level of mobility. Some require assistance to walk, others need help climbing stairs, and still others use wheelchairs or other forms of assistive devices to facilitate movement. For most individuals who progress to the point where they experience functional limitations, treatment options vary greatly depending on the type of disability and whether the individual has an underlying condition such as diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Depending on the degree of impairment, some patients may not require any special care at all and may even recover completely without any intervention. Other patients may be able to walk only very slowly, requiring a variety of physical treatments.
