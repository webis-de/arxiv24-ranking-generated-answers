Here are a few exercises that can help improve your posture: 1. Planks: Start by lying on your stomach, then lift your body up onto your forearms and toes, keeping your body straight. Hold this position for 20-30 seconds while engaging your core muscles. Repeat 3-5 times. 2. Bridge exercise: Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Slowly lift your hips off the ground, forming a straight line from your knees to your shoulders. Hold for 10-15 seconds, then lower down. Repeat 10-12 times. 3. Wall angels: Stand with your back against a wall and your feet about 6 inches away. Keep your head, upper back, and buttocks touching the wall. Raise your arms to shoulder height, bending your elbows to 90 degrees. Slowly slide your arms up the wall as far as you comfortably can, then bring them back down. Repeat 10-12 times. 4. Shoulder blade squeeze: Sit or stand with your back straight. Squeeze your shoulder blades together as if you were trying to hold a pencil between them. Hold for 5-10 seconds, then release. Repeat 10-12 times. 5. Cat-camel stretch: Get down on your hands and knees, with your hands aligned under your shoulders and knees under your hips. Slowly arch your back upward, pushing your spine towards the ceiling (like a cat stretching), then lower your belly and lift your chest, allowing your back to sag (like a cow stretching). Repeat 10-12 times. Remember, consistency is key when it comes to improving posture.

Putting in the effort to improve your posture has huge payoffs. “Good posture is also known as neutral spine. When we have good posture, the muscles surrounding the spine are balanced and supporting the body equally,” explains , physical therapist and certified strengthening and conditioning specialist at the University of Michigan. When sitting, your feet should rest flat on the floor, with even weight on both hips. Your back should be mostly straight (you’ll have natural curves in your lumbar, thoracic, and cervical areas). Your shoulders should be back but relaxed and your ears should line up over your collarbones. When standing, your legs should have a slight knee bend so you’re not hyperextending or locking your knee joints, says , exercise physiologist at Colorado Canyons Hospital & Medical Center. Now that we know what good posture is, here are 12 key benefits along with tips to achieve them. Sitting or standing in a slouched position for prolonged periods of time stresses your lower back. More specifically, it puts pressure on the posterior structures of the spine, including the intervertebral discs, facet points, ligaments, and muscles, explains Strang. Bridges strengthen and engage your gluteal and abdominal muscles, so your body relies on them instead of stressing your lower back. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, instructs Strang. Tighten your core without changing your back position. “Lift your hips and lower torso off of the ground by contracting your gluteus maximus muscles.” Slowly lower your hips back down. Move around frequently—. “No one is able to sit with perfect posture all of the time; it takes a lot of strength to do so. When you feel your muscles tiring, or yourself slowly slouching, get up and move around,” encourages Strang. Don’t anticipate a decrease in lower back pain on your first day. “Posture is something that you should expect to work at your whole life,” says Strang. By stretching your chest, and strengthening your core and upper back muscles, you’ll see gradual but noticeable pain reduction. “Poor posture can contribute to , due to increased muscle tension in the back of the neck. Often if we correct our posture, we can reduce muscle tension and improve our headaches,” says Strang. Stretch your neck muscles with a head retraction exercise This exercise strengthens the neck muscles that are often weak and stretched out. Lie on the floor on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Pull your chin back toward the floor like you’re trying to make a double chin. Hold for 10 to 15 seconds and repeat 10 times. Check in with your body often. “Awareness is essential to good posture. We get busy working at our computers or eating a good meal, and we compress into poor posture,” says Griffith. Post a note on your computer screen",-0.0106715727597475

Used to drive me nuts. She did have a point, though. Beside looking terrible, poor posture can cause neck, back, and leg pain. Slouching is an easy habit to get into, especially if you spend a lot of time sitting--your rear end almost always ends up sliding forward in the chair, putting undue pressure on your lower back. When you slouch while standing, your head moves forward, in front of your body. You can’t see your profile, but next time you’re in front of a mirror, take a peek. For every inch the head is forward of your body, its weight falls on your neck and upper back muscles. Your head weighs roughly 10-11 pounds--that’s a lot of pressure. If your head is three inches in front of your shoulders, there are 30 pounds of pressure on your neck and upper back. No wonder your back hurts. Posture affects how you walk, sleep, sit, and stand. Improper alignment creates continuous tension and can lead to muscle and head aches. Proper posture prevents fatigue and wear-and-tear on ligaments and joints. It is important for good blood circulation and full breathing. You should know what good posture looks like so you have something with which to compare what you see in the mirror: If you’re a sloucher, here are some exercises that will transform your bad posture habit into a better-looking, more healthful one--and keep your mother off your back. If you normally hold your head forward from your shoulders, this exercise will strengthen your neck muscles so you’ll find it easier to hold that 10-pound rock on the top of your body in its proper position. It can be done sitting or standing--a good little exercise break from pounding away at the computer. Looking straight ahead, place two fingers on your chin, slightly tuck it and push your head back; tucking your chin as far under as is comfortable to get a stretch. Neck Pain - Chin Tuck Exercises and Improve Posture for Relief This is good exercise to do in your car, using the headrest as opposing stationary force (only while car is stopped, of course). Press the back of your head into the headrest for 3-5 seconds. This one feels sooo good. It will open and loosen tight chest muscles. Stand in a doorway and place your leg closer to the doorjamb slightly bent and in front of you, the opposite leg behind with the ball of the foot on the floor.

Straighten up with this perfect posture workout routine Good posture, like TiVo instructions, usually gets banished to your brain's bottom drawer. But it's something worth thinking about: Not only does it make you look taller and slimmer, but it also aids digestion and helps you . ""When you slouch you get less oxygen to your muscles and impair blood flow to your gut, causing indigestion. You also get headaches from cramped neck muscles and look lousy,"" says Drew DeMann, Ph.D., of Manhattan Spine and Sports Therapy. Incorporate these posture-enhancing exercises into your fitness routine — and straighten yourself out. It strengthens your upper back and shoulders to keep them from rounding forward. ""This can improve your breathing and increase energy,"" Dr. DeMann says. Sit on a stability ball with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor, and your neck in line with your back. Grip a 5-pound dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing each other and your elbows bent at 90-degree angles. Row the weights to your sides, squeezing your shoulder blades together. It will help elongate your spine. ""Your head weighs the same as a small TV set,"" says Richard Brennan, author of five books on the Alexander Technique, which is a gentle, dance-inspired method known for enhancing posture. By relieving your spine of that compression, he says, you can stand half of an inch taller. Lie on a mat with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Support your head with a small pillow and, with your eyes open, let your body sink into the mat as you focus on lengthening your spine. Think of your pelvis releasing away from your head. Allow yourself to breathe deeply and continue for 20 minutes. ""You won't notice much at first, but after a few weeks, you'll have better posture,"" Brennan says. But don't confuse this exercise with sleep. ""It's different because you're lying still, consciously releasing your spine. And bending your knees especially relieves spinal pressure,"" says Mischul Brownstone, a bodywork specialist in Charlotte, Vermont. This move stretches your back, strengthens your abs and legs, and aids circulation and digestion. ""Good posture comes from a strong core, and Pilates strengthens the powerhouse,"" says Brooke Siler, author of .

gpt2-xl_131_multimedqa_3,"Good posture is not only good for you as an individual, it also means that your body will be able to support you through life more effectively. Properly trained bodies have strong bones, which provide stability in a healthy way. However, if your bones are weak or overworked, then the result may be injury. Therefore, make sure you get enough sleep, eat well, and avoid injuries by taking regular physical activity into consideration when developing good posture. You can do so with some simple steps. For example: \u201cGet plenty of rest. Sleep 6 hours a day. Make time to go outside for exercise. Do cardio or weight training. Get at least 30 minutes of moderate activity 5 days per week.\u201dIf this doesn't seem like much, think of the benefits on your mood, energy levels, and general health! The best thing about getting enough sleep is that, because your body is no longer working to produce extra energy from food, you won't be feeling hungry during the day, and you'll feel more satisfied with what you're eating. In addition to improving energy levels, exercise helps prevent many diseases by promoting healthier metabolism. It also reduces inflammation, improves immune function, and boosts overall strength and stamina. A variety of different types of exercise including resistance training, martial arts, swimming, cycling, and dancing can help to keep you active. One of the easiest ways to improve your health while you're sitting down is to start walking or riding a bike. Studies show that just 15 minutes a day of brisk walking is as effective at reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors as 10 years of smoking. Some people find that they benefit from even less vigorous exercise such as using the stairs instead of the elevator.

gpt2-large_131_multimedqa_8,"\qquad[What is the name of a well known exercise that works so well for people with neck pain?]\n\n1) The ""Wall"" Lie (Lie on your back with one knee bent at 90 degrees). It's best if you hold it in place while lying flat or on a pillow. This will help prevent the muscles from being strained by the stress of sitting down. You can bend your knees higher than they should be but this doesn't work as well because the extra pressure on the lower spine causes strain in your cervical vertebrae. 2) The Wall Rope Lie is an advanced variation on the Wall Lie. If you have trouble keeping your legs straight during the Wall Lie, try using a rope instead. Hold onto the end of the rope and lean forward. Keep a neutral spine position throughout while holding the weight of your body against the ceiling above your head. To increase flexibility, use a barbell or dumbbell between your thighs and push against the wall with both arms to activate your core. To keep things light, avoid using any heavy weights. A couple of additional benefits of the Wall Lie include: Increased mobility due to the vertical nature of the lie; Decreased risk of overuse injuries as you become more proficient in the Wall Lie. 3) Wall Sits, also called Wall Hugs, is an alternative movement to Wall Lying that can improve your range of motion and decrease muscle tension. Use one leg to sit up and bring the other into a squatting position. Your bodyweight can be supported by supporting yourself with a support hand or a sturdy object such as a chair or stool. Once seated, slowly raise and lower your torso until your butt touches the floor. Slowly return to standing position and repeat for the recommended number of repetitions. 4) Wall Spinning is similar to Wall Sitting, but instead of resting your head off the floor, spin around, rotating your entire body around the ground. When performing Wall Spinning, focus on keeping your head above the surface of the earth rather than using gravity to keep you upright. Continue spinning for 20 seconds before stopping. Repeat again for desired amount of time. 5) One-Arm Dumbbell Curls works very similarly to Wall Curling, except that instead of supporting your whole body with a pair of hands, you use just one arm to support your weight. Perform 30 repetitions for each arm and then switch arms for the next set. Try this move for 4 sets of 6 reps.",-6.491872310638428
