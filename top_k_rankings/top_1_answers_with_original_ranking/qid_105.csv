chatgpt_105_multimedqa_10,"Wisdom tooth cuts gum pain can occur due to several reasons. When a wisdom tooth starts to erupt through the gum tissue, it can cause discomfort and pain. This pain is commonly referred to as ""teething pain"" because it resembles the discomfort experienced during teething in infants. The cutting of the gum tissue by the wisdom tooth can cause inflammation, swelling, and tenderness. This can further lead to pain while eating, speaking, or even when the jaw is moved. In some cases, the gum tissue may also become infected, causing additional pain and discomfort. To alleviate wisdom tooth cuts gum pain, there are a few strategies you can try: 1. Maintain good oral hygiene: Properly brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss regularly. This helps keep the area clean and reduces the risk of infection. 2. Use warm saltwater rinses: Rinse your mouth with a warm saltwater solution (1/2 teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of warm water) multiple times a day. This can help reduce inflammation and promote healing. 3. Over-the-counter pain relievers: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help reduce pain and inflammation. Follow the recommended dosage instructions and consult a healthcare professional if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking other medications. 4. Topical numbing gels: Over-the-counter oral gels containing benzocaine or lidocaine can temporarily numb the area and provide relief from pain. Follow the product instructions carefully. 5. Soft diet: Stick to soft foods and avoid chewing on the side where the wisdom tooth is cutting the gum. This can help reduce irritation and discomfort. It is important to note that these measures provide temporary relief, and it is advisable to consult a dentist or oral surgeon for a proper evaluation and treatment plan. In some cases, the wisdom tooth may need to be removed if it is causing persistent pain, infection, or other complications.",-0.0089361742138862
meta-llama_Llama-2-7b-chat-hf_105_multimedqa_8,"Wisdom teeth, also known as third molars, can cause significant discomfort and pain when they come in or erupt through the gums. The most common complications associated with wisdom teeth include overcrowding, impacted teeth, and gum irritation. Here are some possible reasons why your wisdom tooth might be causing gum pain:\n1. Impaction: When there isn't enough room in the jaw for the wisdom tooth to come in properly, it can become implicated, which means that it doesn't have enough space to grow normally. This can lead to swelling, inflammation, and pain in the affected area. \n2. Infection: If food particles get stuck between the wisdom tooth and the gum line, bacteria can multiply, leading to an infection. Signs of an infection may include redness, swelling, heat, and pus around the affected area. These symptoms can cause severe pain and discomfort. \n3. Gingivitis: Gingivitis is a mild form of gum disease caused by plaque buildup on the teeth and along the gum line. It can result in red, swollen, and tender gums, and sometimes bleeding during brushing or flossing. If left untreated, gingivitis can progress into periodontitis, which can further increase the risk of developing more serious problems like bone loss or tooth loss. \n4. Tooth sensitivity: Some people experience tooth sensitivity due to receding gum lines resulting from gum recession triggered by the pressure exerted by wisdom teeth coming in. As the gum tissue wears away, the exposed dentin becomes sensitive to temperature changes, sweet flavors, or even biting pressures. \n5. Sinus issues: Depending on the positioning of the wisdom teeth relative to the sinuses (air-filled cavities within the skull), it can lead to sinus infections, nasal congestion, headaches, facial pain, and other related symptoms. Although rare, this connection does exist, especially if you already suffer from sinus issues. \nTo alleviate the discomfort brought on by your wisdom tooth cutting your gum, try these remedies until you see a dentist for proper evaluation and treatment: \n1.

Discomfort following wisdom teeth extraction commonly includes: swelling of the jaw, which can make it uncomfortable to open the mouth wide Although far less common, discomfort following wisdom teeth extraction may also include: damage to the jawbone, sinuses, nerves, or nearby teeth , which is caused by losing the postsurgical blood clot that forms in the socket to help the area heal socket infection from trapped food particles or bacteria Following surgery, your dentist will give instructions on managing pain and swelling. They’ll also tell you how to care for your wound, which will most likely include stitches and gauze packing. Talk to your dentist if your pain persists, gets worse, or you have any other concerns. If your wisdom teeth are healthy and positioned correctly, they typically don’t cause any pain. Pain is usually a result of the way the wisdom teeth erupt, such as: If lack of space doesn’t allow your wisdom teeth to break all the way through your gums, it can cause a flap of tissue to remain over the tooth. This flap can lead to pain and swelling in the gum tissue. It can also trap food and bacteria, which can result in a gum infection and pain. If your jaw isn’t large enough to host your wisdom teeth, they may become in your jaw and unable to fully erupt through your bone and gums. Symptoms of partial eruption can include pain and in the area of the impacted wisdom tooth. Your wisdom teeth may come in crooked or facing the wrong direction. Symptoms of misalignment can include discomfort from the crowding of other teeth and pressure and pain in the mouth. If you’re experiencing discomfort in the area of your wisdom teeth, visit your dentist. They can make sure another condition isn’t causing your jaw pain and get you the right treatment. In the meantime, you might be able to find relief at home. Try using the following: Hold an ice pack on your cheek in the painful area. Do this for 15 to 20 minutes at a time a few times per day. An over-the-counter (OTC) pain reliever, such as (Tylenol), (Motrin), or (Aleve), can reduce pain and swelling.

This is the time of life called the Age of Wisdom, hence the name wisdom teeth. When there's not enough room in the mouth for a wisdom tooth to break through, it will push or get stuck against another tooth and grow at an angle under the gum. This is called an impacted wisdom tooth, and will cause pain and irritation. If part of an impacted wisdom tooth pushes through the gum, the gum may become sore and swollen. Food particles and bacteria can collect around the impacted wisdom tooth and cause decay. It's very difficult to remove that decay and it will most likely cause an infection. In most cases, an impacted wisdom tooth has to be extracted [source: ]. There are some simple things that can temporarily relieve the pain of an impacted wisdom tooth [source: ]. Rinsing your mouth with a warm saltwater solution by swishing it around for 30 seconds and then spitting it out will help ease the pain around the infected tooth. Rinse this way several times a day, and be sure not to swallow the salt water. Oral numbing medications can be applied to the affected area. Over-the-counter pain relievers may help ease the pain. Chewing gum will gently massage the irritated area. These measures may temporarily relieve the pain. However, your dentist should examine the tooth and decide whether further treatment is necessary.

gpt2-large_105_multimedqa_5,"This is the first question that comes up in searches for this condition. There is an article on your site entitled ""Wisdom Teeth Removal"" (http://www.whomishelp.com/wisdom_teeth/) which provides more information than I can explain here. The answer below provides some background information that will help you make informed decisions when choosing between two similar dental procedures. A recent study was done by Dr. Martin Berkowitz, MD, and his colleagues, who found that one of the most common causes of severe gum disease is the removal of hard enamel with the use of a wisdom tooth extractor. This procedure removes the entire tooth and results in a permanent dentin layer. The root canal is then done to remove any remaining bone marrow or other debris from the affected area. It should be noted that there is no evidence of tooth loss after the procedure. The research was done on over 1,000 patients who had undergone at least one wisdom tooth extraction. Although the researchers were unable to conclude anything definitive about its efficacy, they did find that the wisdom teeth extracted reduced symptoms such as pain, swelling, gingivitis and periodontal infections. They also found that the wisdom teeth removed showed improved general oral health, but these improvements did not last long enough to eliminate the need for a second wisdom tooth extraction. In summary, the results suggested that the wisdom tooth extractor was effective in reducing gum disease; however, if you choose to go ahead with the surgery, it is important to note that the technique does have drawbacks; however, they do seem minor in comparison to those of the conventional wisdom tooth extraction. \end quote} So how many times have you seen someone say something like ""I've never heard of a prescription for a wisdom tooth extractor""? Well, let's take a look at the facts to see what we're talking about... What is a Wisdom Tooth Extractor? A wisdom tooth extractor is simply another way of removing a hard enamel layer with a combination of techniques. When all else fails, a traditional wisdom tooth extraction may result in decay. However, the effectiveness of a wisdom tooth extractor depends upon several factors. First of all, there must be some type of base material underneath the hardened enamel layer -- otherwise, there would be no point in extracting it. Secondly, the extraction method must provide sufficient pressure to maintain the integrity of the hardened enamel layer. And finally, if the extraction is performed correctly, there is usually a significant amount of",-1.6349672079086304
