It is characterized by excessive difficulty and/or impairment in two or more areas of functioning that interfere with normal development. The most common medications used to treat ADHD are stimulants, such as methylphenidate and amphetamine. These medications work by increasing the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, which helps to improve attention span, reduce impulsivity, and increase overall cognitive function. However, it is important to note that medication ADHD anxiety should only be taken under the guidance of a licensed healthcare professional, as these medications can have potential side effects and interactions with other medications.",-0.0024644737131893
chatgpt_107_multimedqa_2,"Medications for ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) and anxiety are different. ADHD medications primarily target the symptoms associated with ADHD, such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. They work by increasing certain chemicals in the brain that help with focus and concentration. Common medications prescribed for ADHD include stimulants like methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta) and amphetamines (Adderall, Vyvanse). These medications can improve attention, reduce hyperactivity, and enhance impulse control in individuals with ADHD. However, they are not typically used to directly treat anxiety. On the other hand, medications for anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder or social anxiety disorder, work by targeting the symptoms of anxiety specifically. These medications may belong to different classes, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like sertraline (Zoloft), benzodiazepines like alprazolam (Xanax), or buspirone (Buspar). These medications help to reduce excessive worrying, nervousness, and other anxiety-related symptoms. It is important to note that while some individuals with ADHD may also experience anxiety, treating both conditions may require a combination of medications or other therapeutic approaches. It is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional, such as a psychiatrist or primary care physician, who can assess your specific symptoms and provide appropriate treatment recommendations. They will consider various factors, including your medical history, severity of symptoms, and potential risks and benefits of different medications, to develop a personalized treatment plan.",-0.0040089488029479
meta-llama_Llama-2-13b-chat-hf_107_multimedqa_4,"Medications for ADHD and Anxiety While there is no single ""best"" treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or anxiety, certain medications have been shown to be effective in managing symptoms of these conditions. It's important to work with a qualified mental health professional who can help determine the most appropriate treatment plan based on your specific needs and circumstances. Stimulant medications, such as Ritalin (methylphenidate), Adderall (amphetamine/dextroamphetamine), and Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate), are commonly used to treat ADHD. These medications work by increasing levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, which helps regulate attention and impulse control. Nonstimulant medications like Strattera (atomoxetine) can also be effective in treating ADHD, although it may take longer to see results compared to stimulants. For anxiety, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like Prozac (fluoxetine), Zoloft (sertraline), and Lexapro (escitalopram) are often prescribed first line due to their effectiveness and relatively mild side effects profile. SSRIs work by increasing levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain, which can help reduce feelings of worry and fear. Other classes of medications that may be considered for anxiety include benzodiazepines like Xanax (alprazolam) and Klonopin (clonazepam), tricyclic antidepressants like Effexor (venlafaxine), and beta blockers like Tenormin (atenolol). It's worth noting that medications can have different effects on different people, so it may require some trial and error to find the right medication and dosage that works best for you. Additionally, medications should always be taken exactly as directed by your healthcare provider and any changes made to your medication regimen should only be done under their close supervision. Finally, while medication can be an important tool in managing ADHD and anxiety, it's also crucial to address lifestyle factors such as sleep habits, exercise routine, stress management techniques",-0.0047190720215439
meta-llama_Llama-2-7b-chat-hf_107_multimedqa_8,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. While ADHD can be challenging to manage on its own, there are several medications that may help alleviate symptoms of anxiety associated with the condition. Here are some commonly prescribed medications for ADHD/anxiety: 1. Stimulants: Stimulant medications like Ritalin (methylphenidate), Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine), and Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) are often used to treat both ADHD and anxiety. These drugs work by increasing the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, which helps regulate attention and impulse control. However, they may also have anxiogenic effects, meaning they could exacerbate feelings of anxiety in some individuals. 2. Non-stimulants: For those who don't respond well to stimulants or experience side effects from them, non-stimulant medications such as Strattera (atomoxetine) may provide relief. This medicine works differently than stimulants, targeting the brain's nicotine receptors instead of dopamine and norepinephrine systems. Some people find it easier to tolerate atomoxetine compared to stimulants due to fewer reported side effects. 3. Antipsychotics: In more severe cases where other approaches haven't worked, antipsychotic medications like risperidone (Risperdal) might be considered. Although these drugs were initially designed to treat psychosis, they also have been shown effective in reducing agitation and irritability linked with autism spectrum disorders – including those experienced by adults living with ADHD plus comorbid anxiety conditions. Careful monitoring by your doctor should always precede any new additions or adjustments made regarding these powerful meds! 4. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs): TCAs, developed decades ago before newer classes of antidepressants emerged, remain viable options when addressing coexisting issues alongside ADHD.

It results when children or adolescents have too much energy and not enough sleep, leading them to be hyperactive in school and on the playgrounds. \nQuestion: What should I do if my child has ADHD? Complete Answer: Your daughter or son may need some help with their ADHD symptoms. She/he needs to learn how to manage her energy level by staying in control at home, avoiding risky behavior, and learning skills such as time management. Your son may also need advice on how best to keep his emotions under control by making sure he stays calm and focused. They need to also make sure they don't let other people get into their head while they're stressed out. Finally, your son or daughter will want to take a good look around themselves before taking any action they think will cause trouble. Many times we see kids who have ADD/ADHD go through life without noticing how many things could be causing problems for them. This is especially true when it comes to relationships. If you feel the situation is not getting better within your family, seek professional help. You may be able to help your child to become more self-aware, but even then you may not be able to fix this problem until after puberty. At that point, there are some changes in brain chemistry that come with the change in hormones (e.g., testosterone). Some parents worry that a kid's mood might have changed as well because they think that just being around another person makes a difference. That isn't always the case either. There is no way to know for certain what a teen feels or thinks because of their interactions with others. When looking at the big picture, many teens don't act like they were raised differently than everyone else - they simply didn't notice the changes over time. In addition, because of these hormonal changes, teens are going through a period of transition between childhood and adulthood. Because teenagers are still growing, it's often hard to tell if they are dealing with their own issues or they are having issues related to their peers. Sometimes, they find ways to deal with these issues on their own. Other times, they are able to work through it together. To prevent other kids from hurting your child, try to teach him/her healthy coping strategies. For example, talking with your kid about things they can do to stop acting out will usually solve the issue. Another",-0.0171046089380979

Here are some interventions, ideas and tips for dealing with anxiety in children with ADHD. You can use most of them at home or in the classroom. Social skills training are usually weekly groups conducted by a therapist. However, these skills can be taught and reinforced even at home, or in the classroom. Help the child gain confidence in social situations that they face every day. Provide opportunities for the child to develop conversation skills and other social behaviors. Give feedback and appreciate the child when he or she gets it right. Help the child practice skills that they are not confident about in front of a mirror. This type of therapy can help older children or adolescents with ADHD to identify negative thoughts and dispute them. You too, can use this concept at home or school, by teaching the child to be positive and see the good in every situation. Support the child through anxious times by saying positive, encouraging statements and building their confidence. Some children can learn to keep their anxiety under control with relaxation techniques. These include deep breathing, and lying still and closing their eyes for a few minutes. The child needs to be taught to practice these techniques whenever he or she gets anxious. Parents or teachers may need to remind the child to stop and use relaxation techniques when they find that the child is very anxious. Children who do not get enough sleep at night are prone to anxiety. Make sure the child’s bedroom is noise free, and eliminate any disturbances. Set up a routine for sleeping every night that requires the child to get into bed at a specific time even if they are not feeling sleepy. Exercise lowers stress levels in children with ADHD. Encourage exercise by introducing the child to sports, dance, self defense and other enjoyable physical activities. Allot physical chores in the house or classroom, to channel the . Children who aim for perfection often get very anxious when things don’t go right. Teach the child that some things in life don’t always happen smoothly, and thus they should just accept it if they make a mistake. Schedules and routines help a person with anxiety feel safer. The regularity of daily tasks helps the child to feel safe and secure. It provides them with order and stability. However, whenever there is going to be a change in the routine or schedule, ensure that you prepare the child for it and let him or her know what is going to happen. Learning about their emotions and learning to accept them is a big step towards overcoming anxiety. However, the child needs to be a little older to understand their condition.

Methods: From December 2018 to January 2019, a graphic depiction of medications and weekly ratings of symptoms of mania, depression, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and oppositional behavior that parents had rated on their 9-year-old child over a period of several years was sent to experts in child and adult bipolar disorder. These responding medical doctors (MDs, 8 child and 18 adult psychiatrists) rated a comprehensive list of medications that they would choose (and with what priority) to treat the child's now improved mood (mania and depression) but continued mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety, ADHD, and oppositional behavior. Results: In the whole group, the drugs most highly endorsed were lamotrigine: 69%, lithium: 62%, lurasidone: 62%, quetiapine: 54%, aripiprazole: 46%, and valproate: 42%. Among the antidepressants, 38% endorsed a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, 12% a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and 27% bupropion. Of the child MDs, 75% suggested increasing the 1-mg dose of risperidone, while few adult MDs suggested this. Conversely, 56% of the adult MDs suggested using valproate, while only 1 child MD did so. There was little consensus on how to manage ADHD symptoms unresponsive to methylphenidate 36 mg/d. How these treatment options were sequenced also varied widely. Conclusions: There was wide variation in suggestions on to how to treat persistent symptoms of anxiety, ADHD, and oppositional behavior in a child whose mania and depression had been brought under good control. We surmise that this great diversity in recommendations among experts in child and adult bipolar disorder stems at least partially from inadequate literature on treatment and that a new emphasis on funding and conducting studies on efficacy and effectiveness is needed.

Image Credit: Eviart / Shutterstock Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. The condition is characterized by inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, which can cause significant behavioral, academic, social and cognitive impairments. It is thought that more than 60% of those diagnosed with ADHD will also have at least one other comorbid psychological disorder. Anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are among the most common psychiatric disorders thought to affect approximately 19% of adults each year in the US. The disorder is characterized by persistent feelings of worry, fear, and a sense of being overwhelmed on a daily basis. What separates an anxiety disorder to general anxiety or worry that people might experience is the fact that those with anxiety disorders worry excessively and unrealistically about everyday occurrences such as health, family, and the future. The excessiveness is typically difficult to control, which can significantly impact the individual’s ability to manage their daily life, and alongside this, many may experience additional physical and psychological symptoms. Anxiety disorders are thought to affect approximately 32% of adolescents at some point between ages 13 and 18-years. Like many disorders, anxiety may be experienced alongside comorbid disorders such as ADHD. It is argued that those with ADHD may experience anxiety disorders as a result of their ADHD and the impairments and dysfunctions it can cause. Furthermore, research has found that this anxiety can often be experienced in cases of undiagnosed and therefore untreated ADHD. Individuals with comorbid anxiety and ADHD typically develop anxiety at an earlier age, experience more extreme symptoms of anxiety, and substance abuse issues compared to those with just ADHD. Furthermore, ADHD is often diagnosed significantly later in those with comorbid anxiety compared to those with ADHD alone. This is thought to occur as the anxiety might inhibit impulsivity. Research has suggested that the comorbidity seen between ADHD and anxiety may be due to similarities in neurological deficits. For example, in both disorders, deficits often experienced are associated with executive control and poor prefrontal activity. It is suggested that treatment should focus on addressing the ADHD symptoms as this may ultimately reduce anxiety, which is often experienced as a by-product. ADHD, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Asperger’s ASD is comprised of a set of neurodevelopment disorders which are characterized by deficits in nonverbal interactions, such as facial expressions, body gestures, reduced eye contact, and social behaviors which typically present within the first three years of infancy. The disorder affects males 2-3 times more than females; however, like in ADHD, this may be due to under-recognition of ASD symptoms in females. Autism, specifically, is a developmental disability which causes differences in how a person interacts with others and perceives their environment. As a spectrum disorder, individuals will experience specific difficulties to varying degrees, which may affect them in different ways. Asperger syndrome is categorized as a type of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Those with the disorder often experience issues with nonverbal communication, social interaction coupled with",-1.002102613449097

Abstract Abstract Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common behavioral disorder in children, and the prevalence is increasing. Physicians should evaluate for ADHD in children with behavioral concerns (e.g., inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, oppositionality) or poor academic progress using validated assessment tools with observers from several settings (home, school, community) and self-observation, if possible. Physicians who inherit a patient with a previous ADHD diagnosis should review the diagnostic process, and current symptoms and treatment needs. Coexisting conditions (e.g., anxiety, learning, mood, or sleep disorders) should be identified and treated. Behavioral treatments are recommended for preschool-aged children and may be helpful at older ages. Effective behavioral therapies include parent training, classroom management, and peer interventions. Medications are recommended as first-line therapy for older children. Psychostimulants, such as methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine, are most effective for the treatment of core ADHD symptoms and have generally acceptable adverse effect profiles. There are fewer supporting studies for atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine, and they are less effective than the psychostimulants. Height, weight, heart rate, blood pressure, symptoms, mood, and treatment adherence should be recorded at follow-up visits. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common behavioral disorder in childhood. The prevalence increased by an estimated 3% annually between 1997 and 2006. Recent national data show that up to 11% of four- to 17-year-olds have had an ADHD diagnosis, 8.8% currently have the diagnosis, and 6.1% are receiving a medication for ADHD. Enlarge Print Children four years and older and adolescents with poor attention, distractibility, hyperactivity, impulsiveness, poor academic performance, or behavioral problems at home or at school should be evaluated for ADHD. Behavioral therapy should be the primary treatment for ADHD in children younger than six years, and it may be helpful at older ages.

If you are a healthcare professional and you find any issue, please reach out to When prescribed correctly, Xanax and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common combination. Xanax, or alprazolam, is a benzodiazepine medication Benzodiazepines make gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter, stick around longer in brain cells. In patients with anxiety, this effect has a near-immediate calming effect. Someone with ADHD has a low attention span, and they are overly impulsive and overly active. ADHD affects mostly children. Two out of three children with ADHD go onto have it as an adult. People with ADHD have difficulty managing racing or anxious thoughts. However, Xanax is not used to control symptoms of anxiety. Xanax is approved to treat people with panic and anxiety disorder. Both panic and anxiety disorders are debilitating conditions that make it hard for a person to function in usual situations. Xanax may be useful for people with both an anxiety condition and ADHD. Like other benzodiazepines, Xanax is habit-forming and should only be used short-term. Over time, Xanax loses the ability to manage anxiety symptoms but continues to be addictive even when it no longer works well for anxiety. Therefore, Xanax may be helpful for certain people with anxiety and ADHD at first, but should not be used for a long period. Xanax acts as a depressant but most medications that treat ADHD are stimulants. You should not combine these medications unless they are prescribed by a physician. ADHD medications and Xanax have the potential for abuse. Some commonly prescribed medications for ADHD are: Xanax does not have any drug interactions with those ADHD medications. However, having no known drug interactions does not mean that the combination is safe.
