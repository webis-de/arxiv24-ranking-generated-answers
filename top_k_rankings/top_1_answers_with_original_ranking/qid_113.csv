d50164b0-f9af-4cfa-b831-b2867b10fe78,"Children with asthma having fewer attacks amid the coronavirus pandemic, study says Bronchial asthma is a common medical problem among children. Typically, asthma bouts occur during the middle of winter, while some smaller peaks happen in spring. During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, an international team of researchers has found that children with asthma experienced fewer upper respiratory tract infections, emergency visits, fever episodes, asthma attacks, and hospital admissions compared with the previous year. The team also revealed that 66 percent of children with asthma showed improved asthma control, while in 33 percent, the improvement exceeded the minimally clinically important difference. Study: Childhood asthma outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from the PeARL multi-national cohort. Image Credit: Ann / Shutterstock In the study, published as preprint on the serverthe researchers aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), on childhood asthma outcomes. To arrive at the study's findings, the team used the PeARL multi-national cohort, which included children with asthma and non-asthmatic controls recruited during the pandemic. The results were compared with available data from the previous year. The study participants ranged between 4 and 18 years old and who were diagnosed with asthma. The participants were also being monitored in one of the participating asthma clinics. Meanwhile, the non-asthmatic controls were children of the same age, who were being monitored for a non-respiratory condition. The researchers collected data that include the frequency of acute events, like asthma attacks, fever, emergency visits, upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), and hospital admissions, during and before the pandemic. The study included more than 1,054 children with asthma and 505 control participants across 25 pediatric departments from 15 countries. In terms of outcomes of acute events, children with asthma were not at increased risk of LRTS, fever episodes, hospitalizations, and emergency room visits during the pandemic. However, these children were found to be at risk of URTI compared to the control group during the pandemic. Could Vitamin D be an effective adjuvant to help mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic?

They found that asthmatic children had fewer URTIs, fever episodes, emergency visits, asthma attacks, hospitalization due to asthma, and hospital admissions during the pandemic, compared with the preceding year. Further, the team said no differences were observed in the frequency or LRTIs before and during the pandemic. However, the coronavirus pandemic seems not to affect the frequency of emergency visits to hospital admissions in the control group. Also, there was a decrease in URTIs and fever episodes frequency, and an increased risk of LRTIs during the pandemic. In terms of asthma control during the pandemic, the team revealed that 90.2 participants reported improved or unchanged asthma control during the pandemic, while 65.9 percent experienced an improvement.

chatgpt_113_multimedqa_1,"Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. COVID-19, on the other hand, is a viral illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There is currently ongoing research regarding the relationship between asthma and COVID-19. While having asthma does not increase the chances of contracting COVID-19, individuals with asthma may be at a higher risk of experiencing more severe symptoms if they do become infected. It is important for individuals with asthma to continue managing their condition effectively, as poorly controlled asthma can increase the risk of complications from any respiratory infection, including COVID-19. This includes taking prescribed medications as directed, avoiding triggers that worsen asthma symptoms, and having an updated asthma action plan. If you have asthma and suspect you may have been exposed to COVID-19 or are experiencing symptoms related to the virus, it is crucial to contact your healthcare provider for guidance. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific condition and circumstances. Additionally, following general preventive measures recommended by health authorities is essential for everyone, including individuals with asthma. These measures include practicing good hand hygiene, wearing masks in public settings, maintaining physical distance from others, and getting vaccinated when eligible.

meta-llama_Llama-2-7b-chat-hf_113_multimedqa_8,"Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by inflammation of the airways, which can lead to recurring episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. COVID-19, on the other hand, is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus that primarily affects the respiratory system, including the lungs and airways. Given the close relationship between asthma and lung function, people with asthma may be particularly vulnerable to complications from COVID-19. Here are some key points to consider regarding the intersection of asthma and COVID-19:\n1. Increased risk for severe illness: People with uncontrolled asthma may be at higher risk for developing severe symptoms or hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection compared to those without asthma. This is because the underlying inflammation in the airways can make it more difficult for the body to fight off the viral infection. \n2. Exacerbations of asthma: COVID-19 infection can trigger exacerbations of asthma in some individuals, especially if their asthma is not well-controlled. This can occur due to several factors, such as changes in lung function, inflammation, and immune response to the virus. \n3. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness: Some people with asthma may experience increased bronchial hypersensitivity during COVID-19 infection, leading to worsening of asthma symptoms and potential need for higher doses of medication. \n4. Difficulty recognizing COVID-19 symptoms: Due to shared symptoms with asthma (such as cough), patients with asthma may find it challenging to recognize when they have COVID-19. It's essential to stay vigilant and monitor one's health closely, especially during times when COVID-19 transmission rates are high. \n5.

gpt2-xl_113_multimedqa_3,"\nThere is no link between asthma and COV. However, asthma is an environmental disease which may be caused by the inhalation of smoke particles from combustible sources such as wood or paper, while COV occurs when air flows over surfaces that have been coated with chemicals for protection against fire damage. The two conditions do not usually occur in isolation because the presence of one causes other effects, such as dryness of the nose, coughing or wheezing in some cases, cough attacks, shortness of breath and fatigue, all symptoms which can lead to hospitalization. In addition, there may be other respiratory diseases linked to inhaling chemicals, such as tuberculosis, bronchitis, emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is no scientific evidence linking smoking to these problems.\rQuestion: Why does my child get colds?\rAnswer: Your child has something called the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which makes him susceptible to infection with viruses and bacteria. If your child's body produces more than enough antibodies to fight off infections, he will probably never become infected.\rQuestion: What is the difference between allergies and asthma?\rAnswer: Allergies are general reactions to allergens found on certain foods and objects. These reactions include sneezing, itchy eyes, runny noses, watery eyes, hives and throat swelling. Most allergic conditions resolve without treatment. Asthma, however, results when your immune system reacts to a substance released into your lungs by a chemical reaction inside your lung tissue cells. If this happens frequently, you may develop a severe form of asthma called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or chronic lung disease (CLD). This condition often leads to permanent breathing difficulties, particularly if you live long enough. It is important to understand how asthma develops so that you know what tests to order.\rQuestion: Can I use medication to treat myself?\r\tAnswer: Yes, but only if you follow the instructions carefully. You should take medication as prescribed by your physician and consult with them before you start taking it. The dose depends upon many factors including age, gender, weight, previous use, history of illness or injury, whether you have any known allergies, and family history.

Under normal circumstances, viral infections are a big driver of flares in asthma patients. But research indicates asthma patients with COVID-19 do not appear to have a higher rate of hospitalization or mortality compared with other COVID-19 patients, Linda Rogers, MD, of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, told . ""As we look at data coming out of areas strongly affected by the pandemic, one very striking thing is the lack of high rates of patients with asthma having severe effects"" of COVID-19, Rogers said. For example, she pointed to data from Wuhan, China, indicating that 5% of people in China have asthma yet it was seen in fewer than 1% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Rogers also cited mortality statistics from the , in which ""asthma is not even in the top 10"" comorbidities, even though 8%-10% of New York's population has asthma. Rogers noted chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) comes in after hypertension, diabetes, as well as other types of cardiovascular disease, dementia, and renal disease. This does not necessarily mean asthma is protective, as other factors could explain these lower rates, she added. Patients with asthma may behave differently than patients with other chronic diseases, though Rogers said that seems unlikely, or it could be an artifact of how the data were collected. But if these can be ruled out, it does at least raise the question of whether asthma or its treatment is ""protective,"" she said. One reason that may be the case: The presence of type 2 inflammation in asthma or allergies, which is associated with lower expression of ACE2, thought to be the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in host cells. ""That would be a plausible mechanism by which asthma would not be a high-risk condition, and could be a potential link to what we're observing in the epidemiological data,"" Rogers said. Indeed, she cited evidence pointing to this hypothesis. A study in the showed ""respiratory allergy and controlled allergen exposures are each associated with ,"" and that ACE2 expression was ""lowest in individuals with both high levels of allergic sensitization and asthma."" She also pointed to a commentary in the suggesting , such as corticosteroids, may play a role. Up to 75% of asthma patients in China use inhaled steroids, which ""suppress coronavirus replication and cytokine production"" in cultured cells. ""The possibility that inhaled corticosteroids might prevent (at least partly) the development of symptomatic infection or severe presentations of COVID-19 cannot be ignored,"" the authors wrote. Rogers said steroids may also be associated with lower ACE2 levels, but ""many patients are concerned about the effect of inhaled steroids. There are still a lot of unknowns.""

The researchers believe that this could be useful for patients with the novel coronavirus infection. Asthma inhaler. Image Credit: New Africa / Shutterstock The novel coronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 11.79 million people around the world and killed over 543,000 individuals to date. The virus has led to severe respiratory complications and hospitalization in some individuals. These individuals have needed intensive care and ventilation, and the outcome of these patients is usually poor. As of now, there are no definitive medications to treat and cure the infection, and there are no effective vaccines to prevent viral infection. Researchers around the world are in search of drugs that could help reduce the severity of complications of COVID-19. There are currently 21 candidate vaccines in clinical evaluation and 139 candidate vaccines at the preclinical evaluation stage. COVID-19 is known to cause severe respiratory illness in some individuals. Studies have shown that some corticosteroids, , could reduce the inflammation of the respiratory tract in these patients and benefit them by alleviating the symptoms of severe disease. Researchers in this new trial are studying if the steroid inhalers used for reducing the exacerbations of asthma could be useful for patients with early COVID-19 and reduce their risk of severe disease. Lead researcher on this team Dan Nicolau, an associate professor at QUT, explained that the asthmatics and those with chronic lung disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were on regular inhaler therapy with corticosteroids, were found to have a lesser risk of severe illness in the early phase of the pandemic. He said that this was paradoxical because those with long term lung disease were initially considered to be at a higher risk of a respiratory viral infection such as SARS-CoV-2. He said in his statement, “This seemed paradoxical because COVID-19 affects the lungs – and these patients have lung problems – so they should be more at risk of severe disease from the virus.” Nicolau said, “One explanation for the low numbers was that something these people were doing regularly was protecting them and that, logically, was that they routinely used inhalers for their chronic lung problems.” “Ideally, it may be that the corticosteroid therapy would be given to anyone with a new, dry cough, and while they are awaiting their COVID test results,” he added.

ab3f64cb-6300-4de8-9c3a-86ececcae0cf,"Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are both health conditions involving the respiratory system and can lead to difficulty breathing. There is some overlap between the two conditions and it is estimated that approximately 40% of patients with COPD also suffer from asthma. However, there are some distinct differences between the two conditions, in their pathophysiology, presentation of symptoms and the optimal management plans. The key differences to aid in diagnosis and treatment decisions are outlined below. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways that leads recurrent episodes of symptoms such as wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing, which commonly occur at night or in the early morning. These flare up periods are associated with triggers that cause obstruction of the airways, which is usually reversible. most commonly occurs during childhood, in individuals that have a history of dry cough in the night, although it can present at any age. COPD is a disease characterized by the progressive obstruction of the airways that leads to a reduction in airflow and respiratory function. These changes are not completely reversible and inhaled noxious particle or gases, such as cigarette smoke, are associated as risk factors for the condition. Diagnosis of COPD usually occurs in older adults with a history of smoking or chronic exposure to other inhaled irritants. Both asthma and COPD are chronic inflammatory diseases of the small airways involving mucus and bronchoconstriction that limit the airflow. However, the differences between the two conditions are important and affect the way we manage them. Researchers use urine test to identify and verify a patient's type of asthma Study discusses steep drop off from asthma-related ED visits during spring 2020 COVID-19 Prescribing treatments according to genetic differences could benefit children with asthma The reversibility of the damage to the airways is a major difference between asthma and COPD. The airways obstruction in asthma is largely reversible in patients with asthma, whereas the obstruction in COPD is considered to be irreversible or less reversible. The difference in reversibility is highlighted in the results from lung function tests, such as spirometry. Both show a reduction in airflow, but assessing the effect of bronchodilator administration can help to differentiate between the conditions. Asthma exhibits greater reversibility and results tend to improve with administration of bronchodilators, whereas COPD shows less improvement with bronchodilator medication. The classification of severity of asthma and COPD also differs. The severity of asthma is based on the lung function and frequency and severity of symptoms; the severity of COPD is based primarily on the function of the lungs. As the pathology and cause of inflammation are distinct in asthma and COPD, the treatment plan will differ accordingly. While the aim of treatment in asthma is to suppress the chronic inflammation, the main aim in COPD is to reduce symptoms. There is significant evidence to support the use on anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with asthma to improve symptoms. This is thought to have an effect on the airways by slowing the remodeling that may occur in some patients. The management of COPD",-0.012244414538145

Experts recommend people with asthma consult with their doctor about their medications. People with asthma are also advised to reduce stress and take extra precautions around their home. All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our and follow our for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. But people with preexisting respiratory illnesses such as asthma are at particularly high risk of having serious consequences that could arise from a coronavirus infection. Observing pandemic prevention advice such as social distancing and frequent handwashing can help people with asthma avoid contracting COVID-19, just like everyone else. And there are additional steps you can take to protect your health if you have asthma. There’s no clear evidence that people with asthma are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI). The , however, says, “People with moderate to severe asthma may be at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19.” “We know that the number one cause of asthma attacks are viral illnesses, so it makes sense that COVID-19, which is a viral illness that causes respiratory disease, could be worse for people who have asthma,” , a pediatric emergency medicine and emergency medical physician at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, told Healthline. “Patients with underlying conditions that specifically involve their lungs, like asthma, COPD, and chronic bronchitis, seem to be more at risk to develop pneumonias and the dreaded acute respiratory syndrome associated with COVID-19,” said , a trauma surgeon and vice chief of staff at St. Mary’s Medical Center in Long Beach, California. “Logic would dictate that anyone with lung disease at baseline potentially has much less reserve to deal with a process that limits the ability to get oxygen from air into the bloodstream, which is exactly what our lungs do,” said , a Baltimore-based internal medicine physician with national primary care network MDVIP. “For instance, a person with 100 percent lung function may drop to 70 percent with COVID-19, which is still enough lung function to not threaten that person,” Malinow said. “An asthmatic under poor control, who starts with 70 percent lung function for instance, and is then impacted and trying to function with 40 percent lung function, is going to be struggling a lot more.” The ACAAI emphasizes that there is no evidence that asthma medications used to prevent symptoms, such as inhaled steroids, oral steroids, montelukast, and biologics, increase your risk of contracting COVID-19.

There are three main types of asthma: \Nd\bV\cI\l I2A1 or type 1 or Type A: The most commonly observed form of asthmatic attack: The person experiences severe coughing attacks with wheezing, cough and shortness of breath, often for no obvious reason. This type of asthma can last from one day to several weeks. Symptoms may include difficulty breathing, chest tightness, gasping for breath, and shortness of breath. Type 2 or type II: Severe or prolonged attacks that do not usually cause any symptoms such as wheeze, chest tightness, coughing or shortness of breath. These attacks occur less frequently but still sometimes lead to shortness of breath and/or chest discomfort. Type III (abnormal) asthma, which has been called ""abnormal"" because it does not always result in acute illness. It also occurs more rarely than type I. During these events, sufferers may experience problems breathing, chest pain, or a feeling of fullness in their chests, throat, tongue or lungs. They may have difficulty swallowing or swallowing well, or they may feel lightheaded or dizzy. In some cases, the condition continues throughout life. Symptoms of type 3 (abnormal) asthma include: The inability to breathe when you breathe normally. Chest pain. Fever. Shortness of breath. Weakness in the arms and legs. Swelling in the face and hands. When to see a doctor If you have symptoms that bother you or make you uncomfortable, talk to your doctor right away.
