The progression of MS can be divided into several stages or phases, which help clinicians monitor the severity of the disease and adjust treatment plans accordingly. Here are the main stages of MS: 1. Relapsing-remitting stage: This is the initial phase of MS, characterized by episodes of acute relapses followed by periods of remission. During these relapses, new symptoms may appear, and existing ones may worsen. The relapsing-remitting stage accounts for 85% of all MS cases. 2. Secondary progressive stage: As the name suggests, this stage follows the relapsing-remitting stage, typically after several years. In this stage, patients experience steady worsening of neurological symptoms without any clear relapses. The secondary progressive stage comprises approximately 60% of all MS cases. 3. Primary progressive stage: This rare form of MS (about 10% of cases) is characterized by gradual worsening of symptoms from the onset, with no distinct relapses. Patients with primary progressive MS tend to have more severe disability earlier in the course of the disease. 4. Progressive-relapsing stage: This stage combines elements of both the secondary progressive and relapsing-remitting stages. It features a steadily worsening condition punctuated by occasional relapses. Only around 5% of MS cases fit into this category. 5. Spinal cord disease: Some individuals with MS experience involvement of the spinal cord, leading to symptoms such as weakness, numbness, or paralysis below the level of the lesion. Spinal cord disease can occur at any stage of MS but is more common in the later stages. 6. Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS): CIS refers to a single episode of demyelinating symptoms that lasts at least 24 hours and is not accompanied by MRI evidence of MS. Although CIS does not necessarily develop into MS, it carries a high risk (around 70%) of converting to either relapsing-remitting or primary progressive MS within five years.

Relapsing Remitting MS - This stage accounts for approximately 85% of all cases and involves periods of acute relapses followed by partial remission. During relapses, new symptoms emerge or existing ones worsen before improving over time. Symptoms may include fatigue, vision problems, coordination issues, and cognitive difficulties. 2. Secondary Progressive MS - As the name suggests, this phase follows the initial Relapsing Remitting stage and is characterized by steady worsening of symptoms without any noticeable periods of remission. Over time, mobility and balance become increasingly impaired due to muscle weakness and spasticity, leading to difficulty walking independently or performing daily tasks without assistance from others. Balance problems also increase significantly during secondary progressive MS making it essential for patients to take extra precautions while moving around their surroundings; especially when alone at home or outside.

It is characterized by inflammation and damage to the protective covering of nerve fibers, known as myelin, which disrupts the normal flow of electrical impulses. The progression of MS can vary greatly from person to person, and it is divided into different stages or phases based on the pattern and severity of symptoms. There are four commonly recognized stages of multiple sclerosis: 1. Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS): This is the most common form of MS, affecting approximately 85% of people diagnosed. In this phase, individuals experience unpredictable relapses or attacks, during which new symptoms appear or existing ones worsen. These relapses are followed by periods of partial or complete recovery, known as remissions, where symptoms may improve or disappear. The disease does not progress during remission. 2. Secondary-Progressive MS (SPMS): After a variable period of time (often years) with relapsing-remitting MS, some individuals transition to secondary-progressive MS. In this stage, there is a gradual worsening of symptoms and disability, with or without occasional relapses and remissions. The disease may continue to progress steadily, leading to increased disability over time. 3. Primary-Progressive MS (PPMS): Approximately 10-15% of people with MS are initially diagnosed with primary-progressive MS. In this form, there is a steady worsening of symptoms and disability without distinct relapses or remissions. The progression may vary, with some periods of stability or temporary improvement. 4. Progressive-Relapsing MS (PRMS): This is the least common form of MS, affecting about 5% of people diagnosed. It is characterized by a steady worsening of symptoms from the beginning, along with occasional relapses and remissions. Disability accumulates over time, with or without recovery between relapses. It is important to note that the progression of MS is highly individualized, and not all individuals will experience the same stages or follow a linear pattern. Some people may remain in the relapsing-remitting stage throughout their lives, while others may progress to a more advanced stage. Treatment options for MS aim to slow disease progression, manage symptoms, and improve quality of life. These may include disease-modifying therapies, medications for symptom management, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications. Consulting with a healthcare professional specializing in MS is crucial for accurate diagnosis, monitoring, and personalized treatment recommendations.",-0.0110331233590841
gpt2-xl_57_multimedqa_5,"\nThe first stage is when the body is unable to produce enough of an enzyme called IL1 beta by itself. During this phase, there are symptoms such as weakness, numbness and tingling in arms and legs. This occurs because your immune system is not able to recognize the signal from your own body's cells that tell it to make antibodies against foreign proteins in your tissues. When you come down with multiple sclerosis, the disease becomes chronic. The second stage is inflammation, which means the immune system has begun to attack its own tissue. Symptoms include fatigue, loss of muscle strength, difficulty walking or sitting up. You may also experience vision problems as well as other types of brain damage including memory loss, confusion, difficulty concentrating, dizziness and fainting, depression, anxiety and sleeplessness. In the third stage, inflammation has spread to your bones. Your joints become inflamed so badly that they break easily. Your feet may swell and become painful and painful urination can be difficult. Eventually, your muscles will start to weaken. In the final stage, the body's ability to respond to a normal infection causes permanent damage to the lining of the bowel.

Around 80% of all individuals with multiple sclerosis have the relapsing remitting form of the disease. These individuals have periods where their symptoms are mild or absent (remission), followed by periods of symptom relapse. Symptoms may occur suddenly and in acute bouts or exacerbations. During these periods of relapse, symptoms may become worse each time and the relapsing remitting form of this condition may eventually progress to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, where there are few or no periods of remission. Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis may be diagnosed when two episodes of relapse are separated by more than 30 days or there has only been one relapse but there is MRI evidence of newly scarred or damaged myelin three months later. Patients with this form of multiple sclerosis often experience phases of relapse followed by remission at first, but this later gives way to progressive disease, characterized by worsening symptoms and few or no periods of remission. The least common form of multiple sclerosis is the primary progressive form which occurs in about 10% to 15% of all cases and usually in people aged over 40 years. In this form of the condition, symptoms get worse over time rather than occurring in bouts or as sudden attacks. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis may be diagnosed if there have been no previous symptoms of relapse but the patient has become increasingly disabled over a period of at least one year. http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Multiple-sclerosis/Pages/Causes.aspx www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/tutorials/multiplesclerosis/nr229105.pdf http://www.who.int/mental_health/neurology/Atlas_MS_WEB.pdf http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/10930/29202/29202.pdf Last Updated: Aug 23, 2018 Dr. Ananya Mandal is a doctor by profession, lecturer by vocation and a medical writer by passion.

MS occurs when the body’s immune system abnormally targets the central nervous system (CNS), though it’s not considered to be an autoimmune disorder. The attack on the CNS damages the myelin and the nerve fibers that the myelin protects. The damage disrupts or distorts the nerve impulses being sent down the spinal cord. People with MS generally follow one of four disease courses that vary in severity. The first stage to consider occurs before your doctor has made a diagnosis of MS. In this initial stage, you may have symptoms that you’re concerned about. Genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role in who gets MS. Perhaps MS runs in your family, and you’re worried about your likelihood of developing the disease. Maybe you’ve previously experienced symptoms that your doctor has told you might be indicative of MS. At this stage, your doctor can determine whether you’re at high risk for developing the condition based on your medical history and a physical exam. However, there is no definitive test to confirm the presence of MS and many of the symptoms also occur with other conditions, so the disease can be tough to diagnose. The next step on the continuum is receiving a diagnosis of MS. Your doctor will diagnose you with MS if there is clear evidence that, at two different points in time, you have had separate episodes of disease activity in your CNS. Often it can take time to make this diagnosis because other conditions must first be ruled out. These include CNS infections, CNS inflammatory disorders, and genetic disorders. In the new diagnosis stage, you will likely discuss treatment options with your doctor and learn new ways to manage everyday activities with your condition. There are different types and stages of MS. Learn more below about the different types. This is the first episode of symptoms caused by inflammation and damage to the myelin covering on nerves in the brain or spinal cord. Technically, CIS doesn’t meet the criteria for a diagnosis of MS as it’s an isolated incident with only one area of demyelination responsible for symptoms. If an MRI shows another episode in the past, a diagnosis of MS can be made. The type of MS generally follows a predictable pattern with periods in which symptoms worsen and then improve. Eventually it may progress to . According to the , around 85 percent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS. People with RRMS have flare-ups (relapses) of MS. Between the relapses, they have periods of remission. Over a few decades, the course of the disease is likely to change and become more complex. Relapsing-remitting MS can progress into a more aggressive form of the disease.

Our website also contains information on treating MS. Do I need an MRI? You may be asked to have a CT scan (computed tomography) performed at some time during your treatment program. These scans can reveal signs and symptoms of MS as well as help determine if there are any underlying disorders causing the condition. It's generally recommended that if your doctor does order a scan that it will take place within two weeks after beginning treatment (after six months you should expect to see improvement). However, many people have good results with regular checkups for several years without needing an MRI. When would I start treatment with Cymbalta? If your primary care physician prescribes Cymbalta, he or she will prescribe starting you off slowly with low doses each week until you notice significant benefit. Your doctor could also suggest switching to higher dose Cymbalta when you begin experiencing serious side effects such as joint pain. After you reach 20 mg, most patients experience a gradual increase in dosage over several months. For example, once your baseline dose of 40 mg has been reached, 50 mg will gradually become a daily dose. At 10 mg, 150 mg becomes 200 mg. If you are taking Cymbalta in combination with other medications, ask your doctor about dosing adjustments. As mentioned above, there is no specific minimum dose of Cymbalta you must follow. If you feel discomfort using Cymbalta, don't use it. The amount you should consume depends on how much you're already taking and how far along you've progressed. Don't miss doses!

Pathology is the medical discipline that describes conditions typically observed during a disease state; whereas physiology is the biological discipline that describes processes or mechanisms operating within an organism. Referring to MS, the physiology refers to the different processes that lead to the development of the lesions and the pathology refers to the condition associated with the lesions. Multiple sclerosis can be pathologically defined as the presence of distributed (or ) in the disseminated in time (DIT) and space (DIS). The gold standard for MS diagnosis is pathological correlation, though given its limited availability, other diagnosis methods are normally used. The scleroses that define the disease are the remainders of previous demyelinating lesions in the CNS white matter of a patient () showing special characteristics, such as confluent instead of perivenous demyelination.

It’s considered the next stage after relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). With SPMS, there are no longer any signs of remission. This means that the condition is worsening despite treatment. However, treatment is still recommended at times to help reduce attacks and hopefully slow the progression of disability. This stage is common. In fact, most people with MS will develop SPMS at some point if not on an effective disease-modifying therapy (DMT). Knowing the signs of SPMS can help you detect it early. The sooner your treatment starts, the better your doctor will be able to help you reduce new symptoms and worsening of your disease. MS is a chronic autoimmune disease that comes in different forms and affects people differently. According to , about 90 percent of those with MS are initially diagnosed with RRMS. In the RRMS stage, the first noticeable symptoms include: RRMS symptoms can come and go. Some people might not have any symptoms for several weeks or months, a phenomenon called remission. MS symptoms can come back, too, though this is called a flare-up. People can also develop new symptoms. This is called an attack, or relapse. A relapse typically lasts for several days to several weeks. The symptoms can gradually worsen initially and then improve gradually over time without treatment or sooner with IV steroids. RRMS is unpredictable. At some point, many people with RRMS no longer have periods of remission or sudden relapses. Instead, their MS symptoms continue and worsen without any break. Continued, worsening symptoms indicate that RRMS has progressed to SPMS. This usually occurs 10 to 15 years after the first MS symptoms. However, SPMS can be delayed or even possibly prevented if started on effective MS DMTs early on in the disease course. Similar symptoms exist within all forms of MS. But SPMS symptoms are progressive and don’t improve over time. During the early stages of RRMS, symptoms are noticeable, but they aren’t necessarily severe enough to interfere with everyday activities. Once MS progresses to the secondary-progressive stage, symptoms become more challenging. SPMS develops as a result of neuronal loss and atrophy. If you notice your symptoms becoming worse without any remission or noticeable relapse, an MRI scan may aid in the diagnosis. MRI scans can show the level of cell death and brain atrophy. An MRI will show increased contrast during an attack because leaking of the capillaries during an attack causes a greater uptake of the gadolinium dye used in MRI scans. SPMS is marked by the absence of relapses, but it’s still possible to have an attack of symptoms, also known as a flare-up. Flare-ups are usually worse in heat and during times of stress. Currently, there are 14 DMTs used for relapsing forms of MS, including SPMS that continues to have relapses. If you were taking one of these drugs to treat RRMS, your doctor may have you on it until it stops controlling disease activity. Other types of treatment can help improve symptoms",-3.385452508926392

According to the National MS Society, about people over the age of 18 live with this condition in the United States. MS is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the CNS. This triggers inflammation and damages myelin, an insulating material that surrounds nerve fibers. The exact mechanism of how someone gets the disease is unknown. However, we do know that there is likely a combination of triggers including genetic and environmental factors. Damage to these fibers can trigger multiple neurological symptoms. This includes fatigue, numbness, weakness, cognitive problems, and issues with walking. The severity of your symptoms varies from person-to-person, and depends on the type of MS you have. Many people are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). But over time, symptoms can progress to another type of MS, known as secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). Here’s what you need to know about both types of MS. RRMS refers to a type of MS in which you experience periods of new MS symptoms or relapses followed by periods of remission. Remission is when symptoms improve or disappear. During relapses, you may have new typical MS symptoms like numbness, tingling, and blurred vision. These symptoms can lasts for days, weeks, or months, and then slowly improve over weeks to months. Some people experience complete disappearance of their symptoms during remission. On the other hand, if your symptoms continue, they may not be as severe. About with MS receive an RRMS diagnosis at first. Many people experience progression of their symptoms after living with RRMS for some time. This means that the disease becomes more active, and periods of remission become less and less frequent. This stage of MS is known as secondary progressive multiple sclerosis or SPMS. This condition is best described as MS without relapses. MS affects everyone differently, and not everyone with RRMS will transition to SPMS. But SPMS only develops after an initial diagnosis of RRMS. You’ll have typical MS symptoms during the transition from RRMS to SPMS, but you may experience a slow worsening of symptoms. You may even develop new symptoms. Before, maybe you had numbness or mild weakness, and these didn’t interfere much with your daily life. Once you transition to SPMS, though, you may notice cognitive changes, such as difficulty finding words. You may also have increased difficulty with walking or more noticeable numbness and tingling. The cause of this transition is unknown, but it may have to do with the disappearance of nerve fibers as the result of progressive nerve damage. Or it may be connected to the progressive loss of grey matter, which can be more subtle. Some people transition soon after an MS diagnosis, whereas others live with RRMS for decades before transitioning to SPMS. Since MS symptoms are unpredictable, it can be difficult to distinguish an RRMS relapse from the onset of SPMS. Speak with",-3.484889030456543
