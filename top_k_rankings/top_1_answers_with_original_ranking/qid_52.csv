Some of the most likely causes of mental health disorders are the following: Genetic traits. Mental health conditions can be handed down through families. This means that a person has a higher statistical chance to inherit a specific mental health issue if that condition is present in other family members. However, it does not mean that just because someone in your family has the trait that you will definitely get it. A mental health specialist can assess and diagnose these types of issues. If you suspect that you may have inherited a mental health disorder, let your doctor know. Exposure in utero. Being exposed to negative influences before birth, such as drugs, alcohol or other toxic substances, can affect an infantâ€™s future mental health. Some infants are born with health problems due to these toxins while others may seem fine at birth and develop problems later in life. Brain chemistry. Many mental illnesses can be traced to a patientâ€™s individual brain chemistry. Illnesses such as depression and anxiety can be triggered by biochemical changes in the brain or hormonal imbalances throughout a personâ€™s lifetime. Negative stress from life events. Events that occur during a personâ€™s lifetime, such as the death of a close relative or friend, financial problems or emotional or physical abuse, can trigger mental health problems. Many times a life event may exacerbate other factors that are already present to cause mental illness.
