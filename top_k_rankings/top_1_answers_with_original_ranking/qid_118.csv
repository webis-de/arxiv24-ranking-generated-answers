However, there are still various treatment options available for stage 4 TNBC, which can help manage symptoms, improve quality of life, and increase survival rates. Here are some of the most common treatment options for stage 4 TNBC:\n1. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy remains one of the primary treatments for stage 4 TNBC. It uses drugs to kill cancer cells throughout the body. These medications can be given intravenously or orally, depending on the patient's condition. The goal of chemotherapy is to shrink tumors, slow disease growth, and reduce symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and weight loss. Common chemotherapy regimens used in treating stage 4 TNBC include carboplatin + paclitaxel, gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel, and vinorelbine + cisplatin. In addition, targeted therapies like PARP inhibitors may also be considered if patients have BRCA1/2 mutations or other biomarkers associated with TNBC.\n2. Targeted Therapy: Targeted therapy is another effective option for managing stage 4 TNBC. Unlike traditional chemotherapy, these drugs specifically target cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues. Examples of targeted therapies commonly used in treating stage 4 TNBC include Atezolizumab (an immune checkpoint inhibitor), Trastuzumab emtansine (a antibody-drug conjugate), and Neratinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor). Additionally, research into novel targeted therapies continues to advance our understanding of this disease and offer new hope for those living with TNBC. For instance, recent clinical trials involving anti-PD-L1 agents show promising response rates among participants suffering from metastatic forms of TNBC.3.

chatgpt_118_multimedqa_9,"Stage 4 triple negative breast cancer is an advanced form of breast cancer that has spread beyond the breast and nearby lymph nodes to other parts of the body. Triple negative breast cancer refers to the lack of expression of three hormone receptors - estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). When it comes to the treatment of stage 4 triple negative breast cancer, it typically involves a combination of therapies aimed at controlling the cancer's growth, relieving symptoms, and improving quality of life. The specific treatment plan may vary depending on various factors, including the individual's overall health, the extent of spread, and previous treatment history. Common treatment approaches for stage 4 triple negative breast cancer may include: 1. Chemotherapy: This is the primary treatment option for triple negative breast cancer. It involves the use of drugs to kill cancer cells or prevent their growth. Chemotherapy may be administered in different regimens, and your doctor will determine the most suitable one for your specific case. 2. Targeted therapy: Although triple negative breast cancer lacks the expression of certain receptors that drugs can target, there are ongoing studies evaluating the effectiveness of targeted therapies for specific subsets of this cancer type. Clinical trials may offer options for targeted therapies tailored to certain genetic or molecular characteristics of the tumor. 3. Immunotherapy: Some patients with triple negative breast cancer may benefit from immunotherapy, which works by stimulating the body's immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. Not all patients will respond to immunotherapy, so its use is currently limited to specific cases. 4. Surgery: In some situations, surgery may still play a role in managing stage 4 triple negative breast cancer. It may be performed to remove a primary tumor, to address a local recurrence, or to alleviate symptoms caused by the cancer's spread. 5. Radiation therapy: This treatment uses high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells or shrink tumors. It may be employed to relieve pain or symptoms associated with metastatic disease, particularly if the cancer has spread to the bones or brain. It is important to note that each individual's treatment plan should be tailored to their specific needs and may involve a combination of these approaches. The treatment decision should involve a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including medical oncologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, and other specialists, who will consider the unique characteristics of the tumor and the patient's overall health. It is recommended to consult with an oncologist who specializes in breast cancer to discuss your specific situation, treatment",-0.0021733252797275

meta-llama_Llama-2-7b-chat-hf_118_multimedqa_8,"Stage 4 triple negative breast cancer is a severe disease with limited treatment options. However, there are several therapies that can help manage the symptoms and slow down the progression of the cancer. Here are some possible treatment options for stage 4 triple negative breast cancer:\n1. Chemotherapy: This is the primary treatment option for stage 4 triple negative breast cancer. Chemotherapy drugs can be given orally or intravenously, and they work by killing cancer cells throughout the body. Common chemotherapy regimens used in treating triple negative breast cancer include doxorubicin (Adriamycin), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), epirubicin (Ellence), and paclitaxel (Taxol).\n2. Targeted Therapy: Targeted therapy involves using drugs specifically designed to target cancer cells without harming normal cells. The most commonly used targeted therapy drug for triple negative breast cancer is pertuzumab (Perjeta). Pertuzumab works by blocking the HER2 protein on cancer cells, which helps prevent cell growth and division. Other targeted therapy drugs may also be used depending on the specific characteristics of the cancer, such as trastuzumab (Herceptin) for HER2-positive breast cancer and afatinib (Gilotrif) for EGFR mutation-positive breast cancer. \n3. Immunotherapy: Immunotherapy harnesses the power of the immune system to fight cancer. In triple negative breast cancer, immunotherapy may involve using monoclonal antibodies like pembrolizumab (Keytruda) or nivolumab (Opdivo) to enhance the immune response against cancer cells. These drugs work by blocking proteins called checkpoint receptors on T-cells, which are crucial for preventing the immune system from attacking cancer cells. Another approach is using cancer vaccines, which stimulate an immune response against cancer cells expressing certain antigens. Examples of cancer vaccines used in triple negative breast cancer include sipuleucel-T (Provenge) and talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic).\n4.

gpt2-xl_118_multimedqa_5,"\nThe stage 4 triple positive (TPN) breast cancer treatment is the most invasive form of breast cancer. It generally takes longer than other types to spread throughout your body but can be cured with surgery after you have exhausted all treatments.\r To find out more about this type of breast cancer, refer to: \r What are the characteristics of triple negative breast cancer?\r \r Q. What are the characteristics of triple negative breast cancer?\r\nA. The characteristic that distinguishes triple negative from other kinds of breast cancers is its ability to hide tumors through the use of an abnormal protein called PD-1. This protein protects cells during normal cell growth processes. However, when PD-1 is inhibited by certain drugs or radiation, the tumors grow unchecked, which leads to them becoming resistant to chemotherapy.\r The main purpose of PD-1 inhibitors is to stop tumor growth while allowing normal cells to continue dividing freely. However, as PD-1 inhibitors become less effective over time, some patients develop resistance. In such cases, other strategies must be used to suppress the tumors and prevent metastasis. Accordingly, doctors often administer a drug called docetaxel (Vayarin®) before radiotherapy in order to block PD-1 activity on the surface of malignant cells so they cannot evade destruction. If docetaxel becomes ineffective or there are no suitable PD-1 inhibitors available, then chemotherapy may be administered instead. For these reasons, triple negative breast cancer is one of the most difficult kinds of breast cancer for physicians to diagnose accurately.\r Other characteristics include a slow rate of tumor progression and poor prognosis. Therefore, triple negative breast cancer is not usually treated aggressively; it is typically treated with hormone therapy until the disease has progressed into stages 2 or 3. When stage 1 disease progresses, radiation treatment is given. Once stage 2 or 3 disease develops, surgery may be considered if certain criteria are met. Because triple negative breast cancer tends to be particularly aggressive, it is best to receive regular follow up examinations by a specialist at least every 5 years.",-0.0083087254315614
b5a9168c-d7dc-40a5-ad4d-284487d8b8cd,"New drug combo promises help for triple negative breast cancer patients A new preclinical study on triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) reports that an experimental polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) inhibitor shrank tumor four times more powerfully when used along with standard drugs than alone. The study, reported in the journal , opens up a new door of opportunity for patients with this disease. TNBC is a form of breast cancer that is most common in African American and Hispanic women aged below 50 years. It is so called because tests show it to be negative for any of three hormone receptors – for estrogen, progesterone and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (also called HER2/neu). These are important because they are targeted by many drugs used for the treatment of breast cancer. In their absence, these patients show a poor response and generally have a worse outcome. While it generally shows a faster response to chemotherapy, it also behaves more aggressively than other . It often relapses within 3-5 years of stopping a full course of adjuvant chemotherapy. Treatment for these patients is generally limited to surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, alone or in various combinations. However, of late immunotherapy has been used to achieve better outcomes in a few of them, about 40% in stage 4 TNBC. No treatment is available for the remaining 60%. The current study was motivated by the need to find a more effective mode of therapy for this subset of TNBC patients. The researchers wanted to know if using a PLK1 inhibitor along with a taxane drug that is part of the standard protocol for this disease would help improve the outcome compared to the first drug alone. The rationale was that the use of the PLK1 inhibitor would restrict the ability of the cancer cell to proliferate without limit, and this would give space for the cytotoxic action of the chemotherapy drug. They view the PLK1 inhibitor as something like a traffic signal that hinders the barrelling pace of the multiplying cancer cells, thus preventing the tumor volume from growing at a pace that precludes any use for the chemotherapy drug. Researcher Antonio Giordano explains that it’s like “allowing the taxanes to actually catch up with the cancer cells and kill them. That's why we thought that combining a drug that blocks PLK1 with a standard chemotherapy drug like a taxane would work well together to kill the cancer cells that have lost total control of division.” Taxanes are derivatives of the plant chemicals obtained from certain plants of genus Taxus, commonly called yews. The most commonly used include Paclitaxel (from the Pacific yew) and Docetaxel (from the European yew). They are the mainstay of treating breast cancer in both the early and late stages. They inhibit microtubular function; since this is crucial to cell division, the cell cycle is arrested, and the cell dies.

In 2019 and 2020, fresh perspectives to approaching cancer therapy led to exciting breakthroughs for treatments in research. Today’s treatments are more targeted and capable of altering the course of breast cancer while also maintaining quality of life. In recent years, many therapeutic options have emerged for treating stage 4, or metastatic, breast cancer, greatly improving survival rates. Here’s a list of the newest breast cancer therapies and what’s on the horizon. Trodelvy (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in . It can be used to treat metastatic triple-negative breast cancer that hasn’t responded to at least two other treatments. Triple-negative means the cancer cells test negative on three factors: They don’t have estrogen or progesterone receptors, and they don’t overexpress a protein called HER2 This type of breast cancer is difficult to treat. It spreads faster than other types. Trodelvy is an antibody drug conjugate. That means it targets the chemotherapy drug into the cancer cell and helps spare healthy tissue more than traditional chemotherapy. Approved by the FDA in , Enhertu (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) has been very effective in treating HER2-positive breast cancer that’s metastasized (spread) or can’t be removed with surgery. DXd, a topoisomerase I inhibitor that disrupts the ability of cancer cells to replicate a compound that links the molecules of the other components This antibody drug conjugate is for use by adults who have had at least two other treatments for HER2-positive breast cancer that’s metastasized or can’t be removed with surgery. Nerlynx (neratinib), originally approved by the FDA in for early stage breast cancer, was approved in for metastatic cancer in combination with the chemotherapy drug capecitabine. It’s for use in adults who have had at least two other treatments for HER2-positive cancer. Nerlynx is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This is a class of drugs that works by stopping the abnormal cell proliferation in HER2-positive breast cancer cells. Tukysa (tucatinib) was approved by the FDA in to be used in combination with the chemotherapy drugs trastuzumab and capecitabine. It’s intended for adults with advanced metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, including cancer that’s spread to the brain and is difficult to treat. This drug is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It blocks an area of the HER2 gene in cancer cells, stopping the cells from growing and spreading. This combination injection of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase-zzxf was approved by the FDA in . It works by binding to HER2 sites and stopping cancer cell growth. A health professional can administer a Phesgo injection in your home. It’s for use in combination with chemotherapy by adults with early or metastasized HER2-positive breast cancer. Already approved by the FDA to treat many types of cancers that have a large number of gene mutations in the cancer cells, pembrolizumab (Keytruda) has been studied for the treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Pembrolizumab is a checkpoint inhibitor. It works by helping your immune system attack cancer cells. Alpelisib (Piqray) was approved",-0.0150240063667297

The multispecialty team in the Don & Erika Wallace Comprehensive Breast Program at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, FL, offers the latest advances in breast cancer treatment. We determine the best approach for each patient through a highly collaborative process. For these reasons and more, Moffitt is a source of hope to many people who are diagnosed with breast cancer, including those who have triple negative breast cancer. When diagnosing breast cancer, the experts at Moffitt in Tampa, Florida, look for three specific proteins: estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). These proteins can cause breast cancer to grow, and therefore are often targeted with hormonal therapies. Because triple negative breast cancer lacks these receptors, hormonal treatment options are somewhat limited, but the receptors (or absence thereof) generally have no impact on the effectiveness of radiation therapy, chemotherapy or surgery. After a lumpectomy or other surgical procedure is performed to treat triple negative breast cancer, radiation therapy may be recommended to destroy any remaining cancer cells and help prevent a recurrence. Some of the radiation delivery methods available at Moffitt include: Standard radiation treatment – Three-dimensional computerized radiation therapy (3D CRT) or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) may be delivered once a day, five days a week over the course of approximately five to seven weeks. Accelerated radiation treatment – Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using high doses of external beam or internal radiation therapy can sometimes be completed within a single week.

The findings are published in the journal Triple-negative breast cancers lack three receptors that can be targeted by drugs, meaning treatment options are currently limited to radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The lack of a personalized strategy to apply medicine based on specific features of a patient's tumor remains one of the seminal therapeutic challenges in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer, therefore, exploiting the loss of RB could represent a significant conceptual change in the way we consider treatment.""

Wondering whether the loss of RB could serve as a drug target, the researchers performed a search for agents that could target RB-deficient triple-negative breast cancers. They found that the tumors were susceptible to drugs that target two proteins called and AURK, which are key drivers of cell divisions, as well as a protein called CHK1, which is needed for DNA replication. These proteins can serve as tumor biomarkers, properties of the cancer that clinicians can measure in the blood to find out more about how best to treat it. The researchers found that RB-deficient triple-negative breast tumors expressed higher levels of these biomarkers. Developing drugs that could target these biomarkers may represent a new strategy for treating this 20 to 30% of triple-negative breast cancer patients. ""These studies underscore the importance of understanding fundamental features of tumor cell division and delineating how to target tumor-specific vulnerabilities with new drugs to exploit those events therapeutically,"" says Erik Knudsen, professor of medicine at the University of Arizona College of Medicine.

Breast cancers are often described according to the presence or absence of these proteins and while women with cancer cells displaying the estrogen receptor are said to have an ER- positive cancer, those with none of these receptors are classed as having a triple negative cancer. Targeted strategy has potential to reduce disparities in breast cancer screening rates New mammogram-based measures could substantially improve screening UTSW study uncovers a gene linked to growth of breast cancer These proteins present on the surface of cancer cells pick up messages which promote the cells' growth. The main importance of knowing if a cancer of the breast is triple negative is to determine the possible outcome of the cancer and its treatment options. If a woman has an ER-positive cancer, for example, the cancer cells may receive signals from estrogen that promote their growth. This is also referred to as an estrogen dependent cancer. A hormonal therapy that can decrease the amount of estrogen present in the body can therefore limit the growth of an ER-positive cancer. Women who have a triple negative cancer do not respond to hormonal therapy and are instead advised to undergo chemotherapy. Surgery is performed to remove the cancer after chemotherapy. Radiation therapy may also be beneficial in some cases. In the United States, around 15 to 20 percent of all breast cancers are triple negative. Triple negative cancer is more common in women with certain characteristics. Some factors associated with this type of cancer include: Young age - Triple negative cancers are more common among younger women aged under 40 years. African American women and women of Hispanic/Latina ethnicity are more likely to suffer from this cancer. Women with BRCA1 mutations are more likely to get triple negative cancer. Triple negative breast cancers are often very aggressive and tend to grow and spread quickly. They are also less likely to be detected on an annual mammogram and to spread to other parts of the body such as the brain, liver and bones. These cancers also tend to recur after treatment and remission meaning that overall, the prognosis for triple negative breast cancer is often poorer than with hormone positive cancers. www.nhs.uk/.../TriplenegativebreastcancerMCS6pages.pdf http://ww5.komen.org/uploadedFiles/Content_Binaries/KOMEED079100.pdf http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/suppl_6/vi7.abstract http://www.tnbcfoundation.org/LBBCtriplenegative08.pdf Last Updated: Feb 26, 2019 Dr. Ananya Mandal is a doctor by profession, lecturer by vocation and a medical writer by passion.
