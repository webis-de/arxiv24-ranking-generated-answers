chatgpt_127_multimedqa_7,"Glasses for computer use, also known as computer glasses or blue light glasses, are specially designed eyewear that can help reduce eye strain and discomfort associated with prolonged screen time. These glasses typically have lenses with a yellow tint or a special coating that filters out blue light emitted from digital devices. Blue light is a high-energy, short-wavelength light that is emitted by electronic screens such as computers, smartphones, and tablets. Prolonged exposure to blue light can cause eye strain, dryness, blurred vision, and headaches in some individuals. Computer glasses are designed to block or filter a portion of the blue light, reducing its impact on your eyes. The yellow tint helps to enhance contrast and reduce glare, resulting in more comfortable viewing. While computer glasses can be beneficial for individuals who spend a significant amount of time in front of screens, it is important to note that they are not a cure-all solution for all eye-related issues. If you are experiencing persistent eye discomfort or vision problems, it is best to consult with an eye care professional for a comprehensive eye examination. Additionally, it is important to practice good eye hygiene habits regardless of whether you use computer glasses or not. This includes taking regular breaks from screen time, adjusting the screen brightness and contrast settings, maintaining proper posture, and ensuring proper lighting in your workspace. Before purchasing computer glasses, it is recommended to consult with an optometrist or optician who can assess your specific visual needs and prescribe glasses that are tailored to your individual requirements.",-0.0031557304318994

Prescription glasses with blue light protection lenses can help reduce this risk by blocking 100% of UV and blue light up to 420nm. These lenses also provide excellent optical clarity and color accuracy, making them ideal for reading documents, browsing the web, and working on creative projects.\nNon-Prescription Computer Glasses with Anti-Blue Light Coatings:\nIf you don't need prescription glasses, you can still protect your eyes from blue light emitted by computers using non-prescription computer glasses with anti-blue light coatings. These lenses filter out blue light without affecting color vision, providing relief from eye strain caused by prolonged screen time. Some models may offer additional features like polarized lenses for reduced glare or tinted lenses for improved contrast sensitivity.\nBifocal or Progressive Lens Options:\nFor those who already wear glasses, there are bifocal or progressive lens options available specifically designed for computer work. Bifocal lenses feature two different lens segments, one for distance vision and another for near vision, while progressive lenses provide smooth transitions between different focal points. With these lenses, you can easily switch between looking at a computer screen and performing other tasks without having to adjust your glasses.\nIn addition to these specialized lenses, some general tips to consider when choosing glasses for computer use include: \n* Adjustable nose pads for a comfortable fit \n* Wraparound designs for increased peripheral coverage \n* Durable frames made from materials like stainless steel or Titanium \nRemember, it's essential to consult an optometrist before buying any new glasses to ensure they meet your specific needs and provide adequate correction for any visual impairments you may have.",-0.0043332730419933

It is intended to help people get on with their lives, without focusing on the technology. , in general, play supporting roles in what the user is doing—as opposed to the computer use being the primary focus itself. Vannevar Bush, one of the earliest computing pioneers, understood this idea and described wearable computers and cameras in the 1945 magazine version of his famous essay “As We May Think.” Unfortunately, only early mainframes existed then, and mainframes require that we bring to the computer. Slowly, though, the technology came : from computers on our desktops to laptops to mobile phones. Bringing technology and computing closer to the body can actually allow technology to get further out of the way. While these technologies lowered the barrier to communicating and accessing information, they created other barriers. We are now often greeted in meetings with a of screens that get in the way of face-to-face communication. Can we instead make devices that encourage in-person, face-to-face communication—while still delivering the data people need, only when they need it? I’ve been making and using wearable computers in my daily life since 1993 and have been a technical lead and manager on Google Glass since its first year in 2010.

All wearable computing designs make trade-offs between battery life and weight, size and fashion, simplicity of use and type of task supported. Glass is different both in its significantly different engineering choices and its interactions that exploit wearable computing's main advantages (as opposed to replicating the interfaces of the PC or smartphone). Wearable computers reduce the time between a user's intentions to do a task and her first action to perform it; this reduction in time between intention and action is one of the main advantages. Wearable computers can also be very social devices in the interactions they enable and the contexts in which they are used.

Many have blue light–blocking properties, which is great for anyone who uses computers for more than a few hours before bed. Some people need computer reading glasses because they're farsighted — they have trouble reading things close up. While many glasses can be bought with no magnification, there are also plenty of magnified options as well, up to around 2x magnification.
