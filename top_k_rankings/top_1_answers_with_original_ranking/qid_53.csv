Self-help therapy is an approach to help individuals develop meaningful and lasting change in ways that address underlying problems rather than relying solely on external treatments and interventions. Self-help therapists seek to identify the root causes of symptoms that have been causing them distress, then work with clients to resolve those issues through practical strategies they choose themselves. By identifying and resolving personal conflicts, self-help practitioners create new opportunities for positive growth, resulting in happier lives. Learn more at http://www.selfhelptherapy.com/. Why does someone need to be in treatment? Treatment for mental illness is not only important for the person receiving treatment but also for society at large. Research shows that treating people who experience mental illnesses can improve the quality of life of others as well as promote social support and reduce stigma associated with mental illnesses. In addition, there is evidence showing that mental illnesses can affect people's relationships and work performance. These effects may last long after the patient leaves treatment. For example, while treatment may relieve some symptoms of anxiety, many of these symptoms return when patients return home or if they become involved in other activities. Furthermore, because most cases of mental illness do not require hospitalization, many people will go untreated until they're ready to seek treatment.

However, recent studies suggest that psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are related to genetic factors.
