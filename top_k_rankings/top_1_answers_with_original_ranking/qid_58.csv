Here's an overview of the potential risks and contributing factors associated with MS:\n1. Genetic predisposition: Having a family history of MS increases your risk of developing the disease. Researchers have identified several genes that may contribute to the risk of MS, but more research is needed to fully understand their role in the development of the condition. \n2. Age and gender: MS is most commonly diagnosed in people between the ages of 20 and 50, and women are more than twice as likely as men to develop the disease. \n3. Ethnicity: People of European descent are at higher risk of developing MS than those from other ethnic backgrounds. \n4. Vitamin D levels: Low vitamin D levels have been linked to an increased risk of developing MS. This may be due to the fact that vitamin D plays a role in regulating the immune system and preventing inflammation in the central nervous system. \n5. Smoking: Smoking has been linked to an increased risk of developing MS, although the exact mechanism is not clear. Quitting smoking can help reduce this risk. \n6. Obesity: Being obese or having a high body mass index (BMI) may increase the risk of developing MS, possibly because excess weight can lead to chronic low-grade inflammation. \n7. Infections: Some viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus, have been linked to the development of MS. However, it's important to note that not everyone who experiences these infections will go on to develop MS. \n8. Lack of physical activity: A sedentary lifestyle may increase the risk of developing MS, possibly because regular exercise helps maintain a healthy weight and reduces stress. \nWhile some of these factors cannot be changed, others can be modified to potentially lower your risk of developing MS. For example, quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy diet and exercise routine, and managing stress can all help reduce your risk of developing this condition.""",-0.0198040101677179

While there are certain risk factors associated with developing MS, it's essential to understand that not everyone who experiences these risks will necessarily develop the condition. Here are some of the potential risk factors for developing MS:\n1. Genetics: MS is more prevalent in people with a family history of the condition, particularly those with close relatives diagnosed with MS. Research has identified several genetic variations linked to increased risk, such as the HLA genes DRB1*1501 and DQA1*0602.\nRisk factor: 8-10 times higher than average\n2. Age: Although MS can occur at any age, the majority of cases are diagnosed between ages 20 and 50. Women are more likely to be affected before menopause, while men tend to develop symptoms later in life.\nRisk factor: 3-4 times higher than average\n3. Gender: Females have a higher incidence rate of MS compared to males, accounting for approximately 75% of all diagnoses. This gender discrepancy may be attributed to hormonal influences, immune differences, or other unknown factors.\nRisk factor: Approximately twice as high as in males\n4. Ethnicity: Caucasians have a slightly higher risk of developing MS compared to individuals from other ethnicities. However, this difference may be due to environmental factors, such as exposure to vitamin D deficiency or infectious diseases during childhood or early adulthood.\nRisk factor: Slightly higher than average\n5. Environmental factors: Exposure to viruses like Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is highly prevalent worldwide, seems to increase the risk of developing MS. Other environmental triggers could involve stress, smoking, lack of physical activity, or poor dietary habits, but their impact on MS development remains inconclusive or controversial.\nOther potential risk factors include obesity, hypertension, thyroid problems, and low levels of education.

chatgpt_58_multimedqa_8,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disorder that affects the central nervous system. While the exact cause of MS is unknown, researchers believe that a combination of genetic, environmental, and autoimmune factors may play a role in its development. Several risk factors have been identified that may increase the likelihood of developing MS. These include: 1. Genetics: Having a family history of MS can increase your risk. Studies have shown that individuals with a first-degree relative (such as a parent or sibling) with MS have a higher chance of developing the condition compared to the general population. 2. Geographic location: MS is more common in certain regions, particularly those farther away from the equator. This suggests that environmental factors, such as vitamin D levels due to sunlight exposure or certain infections, may contribute to the risk. 3. Gender: MS is more prevalent in women than men, with a ratio of approximately 3:1. The reason for this gender difference is not fully understood, but hormonal and immunological factors may play a role. 4. Age: Most people are diagnosed with MS between the ages of 20 and 50, although it can occur at any age. The risk tends to increase with age, peaking in the late 30s and early 40s. 5. Smoking: Smoking tobacco has been associated with an increased risk of developing MS and worsening disease progression in individuals already diagnosed with the condition. It is important to note that having one or more of these risk factors does not necessarily mean that you will develop MS. Conversely, individuals without any known risk factors can still develop the condition. If you are concerned about your risk of developing MS, it is recommended to speak with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.",-0.0272535290569067
gpt2-large_58_multimedqa_5,"\nThe risk of developing MS is increased with increasing age. In general, people between ages 50 to 70 who have had MS for at least 10 years show the greatest increases in risk. However, this risk increase varies greatly by individual. The most important factor that influences the risk of developing MS is whether or not you've had MS before. There is no specific ""best time"" when you should start therapy with an MS drug; however, as your condition improves, more severe symptoms will become less frequent. At some point during treatment with an MS drug, you may experience a relapse of MS symptoms. Even if this does occur, however, it's unlikely to be lasting enough to warrant further treatment. Your likelihood of having long-term (at least 3 months) or persistent (in at least 6 weeks) MS symptoms depends on many factors, including your current age, how much disease you already have, the severity of your illness, your family history of MS and other factors. A person's chance of going through a full course of MS medications increases with his/her age. For example, someone 65 years old has a 1 in 2 chance of getting an MS drug after taking one of these drugs within the past year, while a 20-year-old has only a 1 in 5 chance. The longer the disease goes untreated, the greater the chances are that patients will eventually go through a relapse. If you're considering starting new medication, make sure you know all of the potential risks and benefits. It's also best to get advice from your doctor and/or pharmacist about possible side effects. What is MS? MS affects up to 25% of people with the neurological condition. Most of the MS patients live with their condition without any significant problems. People who do experience serious symptoms can often manage them themselves with the help of medicines such as corticosteroids and anti-inflammatory medications. They'll continue to benefit from the medications they take until they stop taking them altogether. What causes MS? MS occurs when a cell dies and then becomes cancerous. This results in lesions on the brain and spinal cord which eventually damage the nerves. These nerve cells normally do not die but instead form tumors known as neurofibromas. These tumors can move throughout the body, causing numbness, tingling, weakness, paralysis, loss of vision, and sometimes even death. You may notice signs and symptoms such as muscle pain, fatigue, joint aches, fever, and gastrointestinal issues among others. But there are two main types of",-0.1148129105567932

0b618efd-09d3-42ae-a88e-42602d4f61f6,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease caused by damage to the nerve fibres in the central nervous system. This damage disrupts the signals sent to and from the brain. MS is a progressive disease that worsens over time, eventually leading to death. The central nervous system comprises the brain, spinal cord and a network of nerves that conduct messages across the body for controlling movements and actions. These nerve fibres are covered by an insulating substance called myelin that protects the nerve and aids the transport of impulses to and from the brain. In MS, this myelin becomes damaged, which interferes with conduction of the nerve signals, which may be slowed or not transported at all. MS is an autoimmune disease. Usually, the immune system protects the body against invading microbes or foreign bodies but in autoimmune diseases, the immune system mistakes healthy body tissue for foreign or damaged tissue that needs to be attacked. Nerve insulation renewed to create long-term learning Drug prices beat inflation all the way even with discounts Study finds higher suicide rate among people with neurological disorders In MS, the immune system mistakes the protective myelin sheath for a foreign body and mounts an attack against it. This destroys the myelin, which becomes inflamed in small areas called plaques or lesions of demyelination. As the inflammation subsides, the myelin left behind may be scarred (sclerosis) and the nerve fibre underneath may be damaged. The exact cause of MS is not clearly understood but both genetic factors and environmental factors seem to play a role in causing the condition. MS is not classed as a genetic condition because no one gene has yet been identified as causing the condition. However, researchers have shown that individuals with a relative who has had MS are more likely to develop it. Studies have also shown that if a twin develops the condition, the risk of the other twin developing MS is one in four. Research into the contribution of certain gene combinations to the risk of developing MS is ongoing. Worldwide studies into MS suggest that individuals from countries that lie further north of the equator may be at a greater risk for the condition, which is more common in countries such as the UK and Scandinavia than in Ecuador or Malaysia, for example. Some studies have shown that lack of sunlight and a subsequent lack of Vitamin D may be linked to the incidence of MS. Some researchers also believe MS may result from viral infection of the nervous system and/or the immune system and the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has commonly been implicated as a cause of MS. http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Multiple-sclerosis/Pages/Causes.aspx www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/tutorials/multiplesclerosis/nr229105.pdf http://www.who.int/mental_health/neurology/Atlas_MS_WEB.pdf http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/10930/29202/29202.pdf Last Updated: Aug 23, 2018 Dr. Ananya Mandal is a doctor by profession, lecturer by vocation and a medical writer by passion.

By: | Individuals who are obese in early adulthood are at a heightened risk of developing , a new study warns. MS is a progressive neurological disorder, which attacks the spinal cord and brain as well as can lead to disability and death. The findings showed that a change in body mass index from overweight to obese was associated with an increase of about 40 per cent in the risk of MS. These findings may carry important public health implications because of the high prevalence of obesity in many countries note the authors in their research article, said Brent Richards from the Jewish General Hospital in Canada.

Question: What is Multiple Sclerosis?\nComplete Answer: Multiple Sclerosis is the name given to a group of neurological disorders that affect the central nervous system (CNS) that affects 1% of all Americans between ages 18 and 64. The most commonly affected areas include the brain, spinal cord, optic nerves (eyes), arms/legs, hands, feet, and legs. In addition to these CNS abnormalities, MS patients experience pain throughout their bodies as well as cognitive impairments, memory loss, social withdrawal, inability to control muscles or speech, headaches, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, depression, nausea, vomiting, and poor concentration. Some people with MS even report feeling trapped inside their own body with a constant sensation of ""being out of place"". Other people don't feel any type of neurological symptoms whatsoever, but still need medication because they cannot walk without assistance; they must wear special shoes to get around, take medicine twice daily to manage their condition, and even change medications every few months when their condition worsens.\r Q: Is MS hereditary?\r Answer: No, MS isn't inherited in its traditional sense; instead, it's due to a combination of factors such as environmental exposure, genetics, and viral infections. This means that, although there is some similarity between people that cause MS and people that don't, there are many different ways to inherit MS including both genetic (DNA) and environmental exposures. A number of genes play a role in causing MS. These genes could be passed down from parent to offspring through each generation. There are two main types of gene mutations that lead to MS which are known as autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive.\r Autos",-0.1915155351161956

""Even one pregnancy was associated with nearly a halving of risk [of developing MS symptoms],"" said study author Anne-Louise Ponsonby, head of the environmental and genetic epidemiology and research group at Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia. The team also found that women who were pregnant two or more times had only one-quarter of the risk of developing MS symptoms as those who were never pregnant. The study was published online March 7 in the journal . Previous research has found that pregnancy in women who already have MS -- an autoimmune disorder -- is linked with lower rates of relapse. Ponsonby's team found an association between pregnancy and a lower risk of MS symptoms, not a direct cause-and-effect link. They say, however, that this association may help explain why the incidence of MS in women has inched up over the past few decades, as more women delay pregnancy or have fewer babies or none at all. The researchers evaluated information on 282 Australian men and women, aged 18 to 59, who had MS symptoms -- which can include fatigue, numbness, balance or walking problems -- but had not been diagnosed with the disease. The researchers looked at both the number of live births and pregnancies lasting at least 20 weeks in the women. They also recorded the number of children born to men. They compared those statistics to 542 men and women without MS symptoms. No link was found between the number of children men had and their risk of MS symptoms. There was an association with women, however: the risk of developing MS symptoms decreased as the number of pregnancies increased. The researchers couldn't say exactly why pregnancy may lower MS risk, but they speculated it could be the increase in estrogen during pregnancy or the effect pregnancy has on inflammatory genes involved in MS. The study was funded by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and other organizations. Women are more likely than men to develop MS. Having a close relative with MS also increases your risk. About 400,000 people in the United States have MS, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. The new data supports information already known about MS and pregnancy, said Karen Blitz-Shabbir, director of the Multiple Sclerosis Care Center at North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System in Manhasset, N.Y. ""It is generally accepted that pregnancy is 'protective' in that it reduces the relapse rate during pregnancy,"" Blitz-Shabbir said. ""While these study results should be replicated, it again shows us favorable effects of pregnancy in women. This may help us frame future studies looking into hormonal treatment or other treatments that may alter the disease course."" To learn more about visit the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.

People with multiple sclerosis (MS) may have a greater risk for developing cancer than people in the general population, according to new research. These findings were presented last week at the fifth European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Congress in Oslo, Norway. “This study is the first to compare cancer risk in MS with non-affected siblings of MS patients. The risk assessment between these two groups is extremely interesting because they share the same genetics and environmental conditions,” , postdoctoral researcher at the Western Norway Regional Health Authority and lead researcher, said in a press release. The research was based on data from various Norwegian MS and cancer registries. Included were 6,883 people with MS who were born between 1930 and 1979, as well as 8,918 siblings and 37,919 people without MS. The overall cancer risk for people with MS was 14 percent higher than for people without MS, according to the study’s researchers. They also reported the risk was especially high for certain cancers. The increase in risk was 66 percent for respiratory cancers, 52 percent for central nervous system cancers, and 51 percent for urinary cancers. When compared with their siblings, however, people with MS didn’t have an overall higher risk for cancer. That’s because siblings of people with MS were found to have a higher risk for hematological cancers than people with MS and people in the general population. Study authors acknowledge the increased cancer risk for people with MS may be due to excessive smoking and surveillance bias. This was an observational study. Grytten cautioned that conclusions about causality can’t be made. is a medical oncologist and medical director of MemorialCare Cancer Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in California. Jacoub told Healthline it’s important to keep in mind that the study took place in another country. That means demographic and environmental differences exist. “When making population-based studies and comparing to another place, there are inherent variables impossible to control for. Nonetheless, they had a good number of patients, and the increased rates of cancer were unusually high,” he said. According to the Cleveland Clinic Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis, smoking is common among people with MS. Surveys indicate that 45 to 52 percent of people with MS are current or past smokers. Smokers develop more autoimmune conditions and higher levels of co-morbidities. One of the most common co-morbidities for people with MS is chronic lung disease. The study spanned 65 years, during which time smoking rates generally declined. The puts the smoking rate at 35 percent in 1990 versus 17 percent in 2013. In the United States, cigarette smoking rates among adults fell from 43 percent in 1965 to 14 percent in 2017, according to the .
