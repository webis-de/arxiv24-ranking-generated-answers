chatgpt_83_multimedqa_2,"Getting an episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis (MS) is important for several reasons. Firstly, MS is a chronic neurological condition characterized by relapses and remissions. A relapse, also known as an exacerbation or flare-up, refers to the sudden onset or worsening of MS symptoms. These episodes can vary in duration and severity, and may involve a wide range of symptoms such as fatigue, numbness or tingling, muscle weakness, problems with coordination and balance, vision changes, and cognitive difficulties. A relapse can be a sign of disease activity and progression in MS. By diagnosing a relapse, the doctor can assess the impact on the patient's overall health and determine the appropriate course of treatment. Timely intervention may help reduce the duration and severity of the relapse, alleviate symptoms, and potentially slow down the progression of the disease. Secondly, distinguishing a relapse from other potential causes of symptoms is crucial. Certain conditions or factors, such as infections, heat exposure, stress, or medication side effects, can mimic or worsen MS symptoms. A doctor's evaluation is essential to rule out other possible causes and confirm that the symptoms are indeed due to an MS relapse. Additionally, diagnosing a relapse can guide treatment decisions. Depending on the severity and impact of the relapse, treatment options may include high-dose corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and hasten recovery. In some cases, disease-modifying therapies may need adjustment or consideration of alternative treatments. Lastly, documenting relapses helps in monitoring disease progression and response to treatment. Regularly tracking relapses and their impact on a patient's quality of life provides valuable information for healthcare providers to assess the effectiveness of the current treatment plan and make any necessary adjustments. In summary, getting an episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis is crucial for appropriate management and treatment decisions. It helps confirm the presence of disease activity, rule out other potential causes, guide therapy choices, and monitor disease progression. Seeking medical evaluation for MS relapses ensures comprehensive care and optimization of the patient's health outcomes.",-0.0021482266020029

Aug 23rd 2019 (edited) Answer to ""Why get episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis?"" Why Get Episode Diagnosed By A Doctor As A Relapse Of Multiple Sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. It can cause various symptoms such as numbness, weakness, tingling sensations, blurred vision, and difficulty with balance and coordination. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, it is essential to see your neurologist for proper evaluation and diagnosis. Here are some reasons why getting an episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis is crucial: Accurate diagnosis: An accurate diagnosis from a qualified neurologist helps in identifying specific treatment options for managing relapses effectively. The specialist will perform physical examinations, review patient histories, conduct laboratory tests like MRI scans, CSF analysis, and other diagnostic tools to determine if the current episode is indeed a relapse of MS. Proper treatment planning: Without proper diagnosis, patients may receive incorrect medication or therapy, which could be harmful or ineffective. A correct diagnosis enables doctors to prescribe appropriate treatments tailored to manage the symptoms and slow down progression. For instance, corticosteroids might be prescribed during relapses to reduce inflammation and hasten recovery time. Other options include disease-modifying drugs designed to limit further damage in the central nervous system. Monitoring progression: Accurately diagnosing episodes as relapses allows doctors to monitor disease activity over time. This information helps them adjust treatment strategies accordingly based on individual patient needs. Monitoring also helps identify early signs of potential complications requiring prompt intervention. These complications include optic neuritis, spasticity management, bladder dysfunction, and cognitive impairment among others. Relieving anxiety: Patients often worry when they experience new or recurring symptoms related to their condition. A thorough evaluation by",-0.002312249969691
meta-llama_Llama-2-7b-chat-hf_83_multimedqa_9,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS), leading to communication problems between the brain and the rest of the body. In recent years, there has been significant progress in understanding MS pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, treatment options, and monitoring tools. However, some individuals may experience relapses or new symptoms after being diagnosed with MS. Here's why getting an episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of MS can be important: 1. Accurate Diagnosis: A relapse occurs when inflammation flares up in the CNS, causing damage to the myelin sheath protecting nerve fibers. During this time, neurological symptoms worsen rapidly, often lasting weeks or months before improving. To accurately diagnose a relapse, doctors must assess whether these symptoms match the clinical definition for MS exacerbations. This involves evaluating signs like weakness, numbness, vision problems, cognitive issues, or other unexplained neurological complaints related to prior known MS symptoms. Only then will it be possible to confirm if indeed you have experienced another relapse or perhaps something else entirely different from your original diagnosis. 2. Timely Intervention: Early recognition of a relapse allows for timely intervention with appropriate medication, which may help reduce its impact on quality of life while slowing down disability progression over time. Treatment options vary depending on factors such as age at diagnosis, disease duration since onset, number of previous attacks experienced during follow-up visits, etcetera; therefore, close monitoring under expert care is essential throughout this process. Delaying medical attention could result in prolonged recovery times due to persistent immunological activity inside their bodies - potentially resulting in more extensive tissue damage compared to what would occur otherwise had they sought professional advice promptly enough following initial presentation/onset. As mentioned earlier regarding predictive markers within MRI scans helping identify potential relapses early; here we see how critical it really does matter having access to proper specialized support services tailored toward helping people cope better emotionally speaking too! 3.

These symptoms may include visual disturbances, numbness or tingling sensations, muscle weakness, coordination problems, or difficulty with speech and/or swallowing. The doctor may also perform various tests and imaging scans to rule out other possible causes of these symptoms. These tests may include MRI scans, spinal taps, and nerve conduction studies.

gpt2-xl_83_multimedqa_3,"While the exact cause is unknown, it has been shown that many patients with MS who have experienced relapses are also experiencing neurological symptoms such as headaches or nausea, which can be triggered by medications or other factors. Thus, an episode of MS may occur due to medication side effects, environmental issues like sunlight exposure, stress, or genetics. Medical professionals should always screen for the possible diagnosis of MS in these cases before prescribing any treatment plan or diagnosing a new relapse. Why do people ask me questions about my mental health status? People often want information on their mental health status because they think that some disease makes them less capable of coping with everyday life. This belief is unfounded; there is no evidence whatsoever that mental illness causes people's ability to cope with daily activities to decrease. People often seek help from psychiatrists and psychologists when they experience difficulties in their lives, especially during difficult times in their lives (e.g., divorce, unemployment). When asked how someone might feel if he were living through the same time period in their life, most people would say ""I'd probably just start crying."" However, this isn't true either! The person likely wouldn't just cry – rather they would express themselves emotionally, try to understand the situation, and talk to friends and family members about what's going on. In short, asking people why they need help doesn't make sense. They don't know you're trying to help them. You'll only get hurt feelings and maybe even give up. What's worse, people will probably assume your caretaker attitude toward them means you're judging them.",-0.0148981120437383

Multiple Sclerosis: Signs of Multiple Sclerosis Relapse When you experience a multiple sclerosis relapse (also known as an exacerbation or flare-up), it's because new damage in the brain or spinal cord disrupts nerve signals. That's why you might notice new symptoms or the return of old symptoms. A true relapse lasts more than 24 hours and happens at least 30 days after any previous relapses. Relapses vary in length, severity, and symptoms. Over time, symptoms should improve. Many people recover from their relapses without treatment. Damage to the protective covering of nerve fibers interrupts normal signals from the brain to the body. When those signals are disrupted, your body doesn't function like it once did. Things you did easily before can seem difficult -- like opening a jar or turning a doorknob. Sudden or worsening weakness that doesn't go away could mean you're having a relapse. If your vision is blurred or you're seeing double, you could be starting to relapse. Some people also lose their depth or color perception as the optic nerve becomes inflamed. Taking a hot shower or bath or having a viral infection like the flu can sometimes trigger vision problems, but these are only temporary and should go away within a day. Numbness is one of the most common signs of a multiple sclerosis relapse. You can lose so much feeling that it's hard to use your hands or other affected body parts. You might not be able to write or hold a coffee cup. If numbness is new or getting worse, it's time to call your doctor. It's frustrating to forget where you left your car keys, or to have to re-read the same paragraph over and over just to understand it. MS can affect your mind in many ways, interfering with memory, concentration, language, and information processing, especially as the disease progresses. Any new trouble thinking clearly or remembering past events is a warning that you could be in the midst of a relapse. Feeling lightheaded or unsteady on your feet can be an unsettling experience, but it's a common sign of MS relapses. The dizziness is due to damage in the parts of your brain that control equilibrium. A motion sickness drug can take away that 'room-is-spinning' feeling in the short term, but if it lasts more than a day you may need to be treated for an exacerbation. ""Somebody may start to feel like they're drunk when they walk, or they [may] have trouble coordinating movements in their arm,"" says John Ratchford, MD, MSc, assistant professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Muscle weakness or spasm, numbness, and a loss of balance during a relapse can make you uncoordinated and unsteady on your feet. Soak in a hot tub or sit outside on a muggy day and you might feel like you're having a flare-up -- but you're not.

Relapses occur with relapsing-remitting, progressive-relapsing, and sometimes secondary-progressive forms of MS. Relapses do not occur with primary-progressive MS, although patients may experience day-to-day fluctuations in how they feel. During a relapse, inflammation is occurring along the nerves and the myelin, causing patients to have a temporary worsening or recurrence of existing symptoms and/or the appearance of new symptoms. This can range from a few days in duration to a few months, followed by a complete or partial recovery (remission). Acute physical symptoms and neurological signs must be present for at least 24 to 48 hours, without any signs of infection or fever, before the treating physician may consider this type of flare-up to be a true relapse. A pseudoexacerbation is a temporary worsening of symptoms without actual myelin inflammation or damage, brought on by other influences. Examples include other illnesses or infection, exercise, a warm environment, depression, exhaustion, and stress. When symptoms flare, checking for a fever is important, since even a minor infection and slight increase in temperature can cause symptoms to appear. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common type of infection to cause a pseudoexacerbation. Additionally, people with “heat-sensitive” MS will experience a temporary increase in symptoms when their body temperature rises, often after exercise. Many heat-sensitive individuals may opt to avoid hot tubs, saunas, or other situations that can raise the body’s temperature. Relapses are usually treated with a high-dose course of powerful (a type of steroid) over a period of three to five days. These are given by intravenous (IV) infusion, administering the drug directly into the bloodstream for a quicker response. Administration may be performed at a hospital, infusion center, or sometimes at home. Some doctors prescribe oral steroids after the high-dose treatment, to ease the patient off of the medication. These are usually tapered over one to two weeks. Another FDA-approved option is , which contains a highly purified form of the hormone . It is given once daily for two to three weeks and is injected either into the muscle or under the skin.

Integrin b3 and ACE2 linked by short linear motifs enabling endocytosis and autophagy of SARS-CoV-2 Study finds higher suicide rate among people with neurological disorders Drug prices beat inflation all the way even with discounts Multiple sclerosis follows a different course in every individual but there are three main ways in which the disease can progress depending on which form of the illness a patient has. Around 80% of all individuals with multiple sclerosis have the relapsing remitting form of the disease. These individuals have periods where their symptoms are mild or absent (remission), followed by periods of symptom relapse. Symptoms may occur suddenly and in acute bouts or exacerbations. During these periods of relapse, symptoms may become worse each time and the relapsing remitting form of this condition may eventually progress to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, where there are few or no periods of remission. Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis may be diagnosed when two episodes of relapse are separated by more than 30 days or there has only been one relapse but there is MRI evidence of newly scarred or damaged myelin three months later. Patients with this form of multiple sclerosis often experience phases of relapse followed by remission at first, but this later gives way to progressive disease, characterized by worsening symptoms and few or no periods of remission. The least common form of multiple sclerosis is the primary progressive form which occurs in about 10% to 15% of all cases and usually in people aged over 40 years. In this form of the condition, symptoms get worse over time rather than occurring in bouts or as sudden attacks. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis may be diagnosed if there have been no previous symptoms of relapse but the patient has become increasingly disabled over a period of at least one year. http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Multiple-sclerosis/Pages/Causes.aspx www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/tutorials/multiplesclerosis/nr229105.pdf http://www.who.int/mental_health/neurology/Atlas_MS_WEB.pdf http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/10930/29202/29202.pdf Last Updated: Aug 23, 2018 Dr. Ananya Mandal is a doctor by profession, lecturer by vocation and a medical writer by passion.

With relapses, inflammation is occurring along the nerves and the myelin. Myelin is the protective covering that insulates the nerves of the central nervous system (CNS) – a system that consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. Please visit the section of MSAA’s website for more information about the MS process and what happens during an MS relapse. Less-severe relapses are usually not treated with steroids, so their use may be reserved for more severe flare-ups. When treatment is required, relapses are usually treated with a high-dose course of powerful (a type of steroid) over a period of three to five days. These are given by intravenous (IV) infusion, providing the drug directly into the bloodstream for a quicker response. Administration may be performed in a hospital, infusion center, or sometimes at home. Corticosteroids work by reducing inflammation in the CNS. While they usually lessen the severity and duration of a relapse, they do not appear to affect the long-term progression of the disease. As approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), patients are often given methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol®) to treat an MS relapse. In practice, doctors may sometimes prescribe the corticosteroid dexamethasone (Decadron®), in place of methylprednisolone. An oral steroid (prednisone) may be prescribed after the high-dose treatment to ease the patient off the treatment, tapered over one to two weeks. is also approved by the FDA to treat MS relapses and has been used as an alternative to corticosteroids for more than 30 years. This may be helpful for individuals who are not able to tolerate the side effects of steroids, who have found that previous treatments were not effective, or who may have difficulty getting timely medical support for IV infusions. Studies suggest that the effectiveness of Acthar Gel is similar to corticosteroids. Acthar contains a highly purified form of the adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) in gelatin. It is given once daily for two to three weeks and is injected either into the muscle or under the skin. This is then absorbed slowly into the bloodstream.

gpt2-large_83_multimedqa_10,"Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. The immune system attacks the body's own tissues in order to fight off infections and other threats from foreign materials. Symptoms of MS include fatigue, numbness or pain on one side of the body, difficulty concentrating, memory loss, inability to speak, blurred vision, problems walking, and stiffness in your legs. There are many different types of MS, including relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), primary progressive MS (PPMS), and secondary progressive MS (SPMS). These diseases occur when there is another autoimmune disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, or Hashimoto's thyroiditis. RRMS occurs most frequently in people between 35 and 55 years old with no previous history of MS. PPMS develops slowly and usually begins before age 20; it often first appears during the first few months of life. SPMS can develop later than RRMS and may not be obvious until age 60 or older. When you are told by your doctor that you have an MS diagnosis, he or she will ask for additional information. For example, they might request blood tests and/or physical exams. They also want to know if you have experienced any other symptoms that indicate that you might have other conditions that could affect your outlook for recovery. If you do experience these symptoms and think it might be related to your MS diagnosis, talk to your doctor.
