# Task 2: Consumer Health Search 2021

## Topics 

The topics this year are all based on realistic search scenarios. Two sets of topics will be created for the task:

`reddit-topics`: 25 topics based on use cases from discussion forums. The queries are extracted and manually selected from Google trends to best fit each use case

`patients-topics`: 30 topics based on discussions with multiple sclerosis and diabetes patients, the queries are manually generated by experts from established search scenarios

`topics`: 55 topics. 

## Training Topics for Weakly-supervised Information Retrieval

For the Subtask 2: Weakly-supervised Information Retrieval we provide a large set of training queries in the health domain. Specifically, we share 167k+ real-world health-related queries extracted from commercial search engine query logs and synthetic (weak) relevance scores computed with a competitive IR system. As a development/test set, the participants have to make use of the dataset provided in Subtask 1 (topical relevance assessments, document collection, and topics).
