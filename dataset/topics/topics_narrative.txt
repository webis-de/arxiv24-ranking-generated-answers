		<query>randomly gotten eczema </query>
		<narrative> I am a 22 year old female and just a few months ago I developed what began as a few red blemishes and progresses to a full blown rash on both perimeters of my face. I saw a dermatologist twice who looked at my face for around 4 seconds and prescribed pimecrolimus. It didn’t work. Then we tried protopic. I stuck with it for ten days before I decided to stop as it was making the rash worse. The rash is now spreading and my face is littered with inflammation and blotchy red and brown patches. The redness increases at night and the itchiness is unbearable even with ice. Never in my life have I ever experienced such a prolonged skin reaction and eczema. I’m at an absolute loss and I can hardly look in the mirror without bursting into tears. I’ve taken prescription allergy pills and Benadryl and they’ve done nothing. My doctor said we would try cortosteroid cream next but I am really hesitant to due to the risk of it coming back worse. I plan to take an allergy test to see if I’m exposing myself to something though I doubt it’s an allergy since allergy meds aren’t helping. I don’t know if it is the stress of quarantine that caused this but it’s hard to believe stress alone could wreck havoc on my face. Has anyone randomly gotten eczema at one point of their life like this? If so did it ever truly go away? The idea of having to deal with this on MY FACE no less forever is seriously depressing me. I’ve decided to stop using any products for a while not even cleanser or moisturizer and see if that helps. (I was using eczema colloidal oatmeal cream and it wasn’t helping ). Has anyone dealt with eczema on their face? If so did you end up using steroids cream or did something else help? Any advice would be appreciated.</narrative>

		<query>chronic diarrhea short-term memory sweating inability to regulate body temperature heart palpitations dysautonomia </query>
		<narrative> I think I may have dysautonomia. I already have scleroderma so I wondered if there might be a tie-in. My symptoms range from digestive issues like chronic diarrhea to short-term memory to sweating inability to regulate body temperature and heart palpitations. Any vagus function. They don't always manifest at once - right now it's the hot sweating (feels like an adrenaline rush) and heart palpitations I hate. It comes on at any given time but usually when I'm just lounging rolling over in bed or (worst) right as I'm drifting off to sleep. I'll awake with a jolt in a panic attack sweating and heart thumping.

		<query>best pillow neck pain </query>
		<narrative> **TL DR** What is the best neck pillow for chronic neck/upper back pain? *\*aside from cervical pillows- I have one of those already* Let me start by saying- I've had chronic upper back/neck pain for about six years now. I've done PT acupuncture trigger point injections dry needling epidurals cervical pillows etc. I'm currently trying a combo of chiro and sports massage which has helped a lot but I still am having flare ups of neck pain especially when I wake up. I have a nice tempurpedic pillow that I've had for about a year now but I'm thinking it's actually too big and puts my neck at a bad forward angle. Does anyone have suggestions for a good neck pillow that is soft/gives a little but firm enough to get good neck support?</narrative>

		<query>numb fingers arthritis </query>
		<narrative> I’ve recently developed arthritis in my right hand and I’ve just noticed that some of my fingers become numb at night. I’ve been waking up in the middle of the night and have lost feeling so I quickly get my fingers moving and they come back to life. It’s weird because I’m not necessarily cutting off circulation (my hands lay flat either to my side or under my pillow) I’m assuming it’s related to my arthritis because my left hand is fine and never goes numb at night. Does anyone else experience this?</narrative>

		<query>hypothyroidism symptoms </query>
		<narrative> So I'm 99% sure I have hypothyroidism. All the women on my mom's side of the family have it. In fact some have had really bad cases where their thyroid grows polyps that wrap around their esophagus and grows into their chest cavity. I'm concerned because I have all the same symptoms they do and they all had a really hard time getting a diagnosis. I think the reason they've been difficult to diagnose is because we start out with hyperthyroidism then around 30 thyroid function tanks but it drops within "normal" levels. However for us that's low. I've gotten tested before (even got tested by the same doctor that finally diagnosed my mom) and she was like "nope! You're normal!". I'm a few years older now and I'd kind of like to look into getting tested again because I'd like the chance to treat it before it becomes so advanced that the only option is to remove my thyroid. Has anyone else had difficulty getting a diagnosis? Did you have to ask your Dr. To test or look for something specific?</narrative>

		<query>birth control suppression antral follicle count </query>
		<narrative> So I've been on birth control taking only active pills for months now and I went in to a doctor's office to inquire about egg freezing. She seemed optimistic that my ultrasound would be very reassuring but instead she came away from the ultrasound deeply concerned. I did an AMH test and it came back 0.3 which was consistent with what was seen in the ultrasound. I'm terrified. Like...suicidal terrified. I don't have any underlying conditions and while I'm not young I'm not old either. I don't smoke and I'm not terribly overweight. I don't have insulin resistance and my reproductive organs looks good other than my ovaries. I'd been taking the combo pill to skip periods for months now. I don't even take the brown pills. When I first heard that you can skip periods and only have 2-3 a year when taking brown pills I started on them. The first time I tried to have a period on the brown pills nothing happened. No period. This was 2 years ago. I freaked out but they said I just respond strongly to the pills. So I went off of the pills completely and had 2-3 normal periods starting about 2 months later. Could the birth control be suppressing my antral follicle count and amh this much? Please help.</narrative>
