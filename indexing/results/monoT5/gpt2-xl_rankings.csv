gpt2-xl_112,"Asthma is an airway obstruction that causes chronic coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, dry cough, phlegm production, runny nose, and chest tightness (sometimes referred to as ""chest pain""). The symptoms vary by individual, but can range from mild discomfort or itching to severe bronchospasms which cause death in 20% of cases. \rQuestion: what are the most effective ways to prevent influenza?\nAnswer: It is extremely important for adults 65 years and older to get vaccinated against influenza. Vaccination is one way you can help reduce your risk of getting sick with influenza during this season.\rQuestion: What are the signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis obliterans (BAO)?\nAnswer: BAO is a condition where the affected lung cells die off completely while still functioning normally. You may notice some coughing, wheezing, rapid heartbeat, fatigue, a low fever and watery eyes. Your doctor will want to examine you carefully for any other underlying conditions. If you have had BAI before, it may be caused by certain medications that contain aspirin.\rQuestion: How often should I clean my lungs when they become infected?\nAnswer: There are no specific times that you need to clean your lungs; however, it's always best to do so regularly. An easy way to test if you have been cleaning too often is to take a sample of mucus at regular intervals. If you don't see changes within three months of doing so, then your breathing might be fine without taking frequent breaths. Also, it helps to remember to make sure you breathe deeply whenever possible.\rQuestion: How long does it take to recover after I have viral pneumonia?\nAnswer: Recovery time depends on several factors such as whether there was a cold or flu infection, how long the patient had been sick before they got sick, and how much fluid was lost from their body. During recovery, you're likely to feel dizziness and confusion. You'll also need extra fluids, especially during the first few days of illness. If you've been vomiting and/or diarrhea prior to symptoms appearing, you'll need to drink more liquids and eat fewer foods. However, you shouldn't stop eating because your symptoms improve. You could develop dehydration, so drinking plenty of fluids isn't a bad idea either. In addition, it's not recommended that you use ibuprofen until you're feeling better. Ibuprofen doesn't usually work very well",112,symptoms of asthma,-3.1578187942504883,58,multimedqa,1,0.2761904761904762,385,13
gpt2-xl_109,"Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is an inherited disorder that causes connective tissue (fatty tissues that make up the body's connective tissue network), particularly in the neck, joints, muscles, nerves and skin, to be underdeveloped or absent. Symptoms of EDS include joint stiffness; muscle weakness; fatigue; shortness of breath; and headaches.\r

The cause of EDS remains unknown, but researchers believe it may result from mutations in certain genes. It can also develop during childhood due to a genetic change called familial dysautonomia (FAD). FAD occurs when a gene on one copy of chromosome 21 becomes defective causing the second copy to become normal. This results in the development of abnormal nervous system signals or symptoms during childhood such as frequent spasms.\r

What other information do you need?\r


Answer: Well now this is where things get a little complicated because if we go through your profile and look at any of the questions that involve symptoms or conditions, then we can see your response to each question will vary depending upon what you answered for those particular categories. For example, if you answer yes to ""Does your doctor usually prescribe you medication?"" and then choose ""yes"", then your responses might differ depending upon whether you have been diagnosed with asthma, depression, arthritis, ADHD, high blood pressure, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, lupus, melanoma, Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, strep throat, syphilis, urinary tract infections, thyroid problems, uterine fibroids, or anything else not listed in our list above. Your answers to these types of questions could affect your insurance coverage. So it's best to provide accurate answers so the insurance company knows exactly which conditions you have and if they cover them. Remember, the most important part of answering these questions is the first part (the ""what"" and ""why""). Answer the rest once you're confident you've covered all possible situations.\r

So let's say I asked you ""How long does it take to recover after surgery?"" You would likely answer something like ""Well, the recovery time depends on the operation, size of the operation, and the type of anesthesia used."" Then, let's assume that I wanted to know how long it takes to heal, so I asked you ""How long does it typically take for someone to fully heal from an operation?"".

Q. How do I know if my child has been vaccinated against whooping cough?\r

\r

Answer: Everyone should have received one dose of the DTP vaccine before they were 18 months old. This protects against pertussis, a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by bacteria. A booster shot is recommended every 10 years until age 45.\r

\r

\r

Q. Can I tell which vaccines are given during pregnancy?\r

Q. Is there a difference between tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid?\r

\r

Answer: While they share the same name, different strains of tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis cause very different symptoms. In fact, most babies will not receive DTaP, Tdap, and Pertussis shots during their first year of life because these three vaccines are usually combined with Hepatitis B. However, babies older than 6 months will still need to get this trio of shots. For more details on which vaccines are needed during pregnancy visit www.tdp.ca/vaccines/.\r

gpt2-xl_118,"What is the difference between Stage 1 and Stage 2 triple negative breast cancer?\nAnswer: The most common symptoms in Stage 1 triple negative breast cancers include weight loss, pain during urination or defecation, and weight gain. Most women with Stage 1 triple negative breast cancer do not experience any of these symptoms. However, some women may experience nausea, headaches, dizziness, weakness, fatigue, constipation, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, dry mouth, skin rashes, diarrhea, and/or breast tenderness when they first have their surgery for triple negative breast cancer. These early symptoms are often confused with other conditions such as endometriosis, fibroids (an abnormal growth), ovarian cysts, or polyps. Because this type of breast cancer is usually diagnosed after the cancer has spread out through your mammary glands, you will be referred to an oncologist for further diagnosis. Many women who have had previous surgeries for breast cancer have problems finding doctors who specialize in oncology, so it can be difficult to find care. You should talk with your doctor or nurse if you are concerned that there might be confusion regarding the staging system for breast cancer.

gpt2-xl_77,"The end of menopause is the most severe stage of women's reproductive life. It occurs because estrogen levels fall dramatically in the body from previous periods. The final decline occurs around age 45, with all signs of menopause beginning within 10 years after the last period ends.

\t Question: I have heard many people say, ""If you can't eat meat, you shouldn't drink milk."" What is the truth? Complete Answer: There is no scientific proof that consumption of animal products causes harm, but there has been some speculation for some time that certain foods contain toxins which can cause digestive problems. According to research by the Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board, the evidence does not support such claims, however: \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014",105,wisdom tooth cuts gum pain,-0.1489337831735611,1,multimedqa,1,0.012658227848101266,146,1

However, when your boss or coworkers learn of the condition, then there is a greater chance of them understanding and supporting you.\nAnswer: How can I best manage my diabetes when I am travelling overseas?\nComplete Answer: If you have travel insurance that covers all expenses incurred, then you should be able to cover yourself in this case. You need to understand the limitations of such coverage, however. In general, if you incur more than $600 of expenses while away from home (for example, meals, airfare, hotels, etc.), you will have to pay out-of-pocket. Otherwise, you could owe money to someone who is covered by your insurance company.\nAnswer: What does a good diet look like?\nComplete Answer: A nutritious diet is crucial to maintaining a healthy body weight and preventing any type of chronic disease. Although most people believe that certain foods are unhealthy, these items are actually essential components of a balanced diet. The following list shows some of the foods that can help to maintain a healthy weight, keep cholesterol levels in check, prevent heart disease, reduce blood pressure, boost energy levels, support bone density, increase stamina, and improve overall well-being.\nAnswer: How do I know whether I'm losing fat or gaining muscle when I eat a low carb diet?\nAnswer: When trying to lose weight and build muscles simultaneously, the first step is to determine what kind of dietary changes we're making so that our bodies adapt the way that they would naturally when they were eating traditional diets. To that end, we recommend using the following four methods to measure your progress.\nComplete Answer: My doctor told me that he thinks that I don't really have MS because I exercise regularly and eat a lot of fruit and vegetables. Is this true? Complete Answer: Not necessarily. Many people with MS experience fatigue and pain during activities requiring rapid muscular contraction. This happens to many people who are active but not overweight and may be due to nerve damage affecting the small nerves that run along the muscles of the legs, arms, and back. As you gain muscle mass and strength, your ability to perform daily tasks will become more strenuous, which will decrease the likelihood of such symptoms occurring.\nAnswer: Can I still get pregnant after having MS?\nAnswer: Yes!

gpt2-xl_35,"A ketogenic diet is not appropriate for people with diabetes.\r

""People who have type 2 diabetes (Type 1) usually need to control their blood sugar through dietary changes, medications or insulin injections."" \t Complete Answer: A person may be able to reduce his/her risk of developing diabetic complications by following a low carbohydrate diet, but it's still important to monitor your own blood glucose levels and test regularly for complications. The American Diabetes Association recommends that healthy adults follow the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Alternate Day Diet, or the Mediterranean Diabetic Diet, all of which feature lower carbohydrates than most Western diets. Some experts recommend that people with Type 2 diabetes avoid very high amounts of carbohydrates as well.\u003c\/p\u003e\r

""A typical meal on these diets can contain no more than 100 grams of carbs per day—less than two cups of cooked rice or pasta, or one cup of mashed potatoes or sweet potato. Most protein sources are eaten in small amounts along with vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, seeds and fish."" \t Complete Answer: Carbohydrates, like any nutrient, increase your body's production of insulin when consumed in excess. So eating too many carbs could lead to weight gain. However, there isn't enough evidence to say whether low carb diets will help with obesity or diabetes. In fact, one study found that people who ate only carbs actually had better glycemic control after adjusting for other factors. It also increased their waist circumference. When looking at the long term effects of carbohydrates on blood glucose, studies show that they don't cause significant increases over time—even if you start out eating more than 30% of calories from them. This is because the digestive system has plenty of means to break down food into simple sugars before you get any calories in return. Bottom Line: Carbohydrates raise your blood sugar level, just like any other nutrient. They won't make you fat unless you eat a lot of them. \u003cp\u003eThe American Diabetes Association offers several guidelines and recommendations on how to manage diabetes.\u003c\/p\u003e"",""published_at"":""2017-11-06T15:17:00-04:00"",""created_at"":""2017-07-31T20:52:18-05:00"",""vendor"":""Shire"",""type"":"""",""tags"":[],""price"":1099,""price_min"":1099,""price_max"":10",35,Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?,-0.1081264913082122,4,multimedqa,1,0.025806451612903226,340,18

If you have eczema, your immune system has had its chance to kick into gear, so it's not going to turn on again quickly. It may take some time for your immune system to get back up to speed, but eventually it will do so.

Correct Response: There is no truth to that. You are correct.

Correct Response 2: I recently found out I have psoriasis. My doctor said she never saw this disease before in her career. She also told me that psoriasis was always considered as a ""mild"" type of skin disorder, but now I know otherwise...

Correct Response 3: I got the flu two years ago. The doctor gave me a prescription for ibuprofen. However, after taking one of these pills once or twice a day, my nose started leaking blood and my face turned really red. So then the doctor put me on an antibiotic called Ciproxin, which makes you feel terrible, but in a short amount of time cured the infection.

This is why they need to stop this kind of nonsense!

Correct Response 4: I was diagnosed with psoriasis when I was 18 years old. My doctor only prescribed me antihistamines. Then he prescribed me probenecid, which I took every other night because he said it would help heal my psoriasis. After six months my scalp started swelling from all the inflammation in my scalp and I developed a rash on my arms where I used to use to rub my hands together while doing homework. So my dermatologist recommended I take cortisone cream three times a week until my psoriasis cleared up. Now my scalp is normal again, but the problem is that I don't want to be able to touch my hair without itching like crazy anymore. This medicine doesn't seem to make any difference in the symptoms I'm having. What can I do?

Correct Response 5: This question has nothing to do with anything. Can I ask you to look at this picture of a person who is wearing a wig and a hat with a headband around his neck. Is this a psoriasis patient? He seems to have a severe case of psoriasis but he has a good quality of life.

The answer is yes, but there is more than just that photo, so read on.

How can I make sure my weight is safe during pregnancy? Complete Answer: You should gain at least 30% more body mass than you would naturally if you were not pregnant. But don't worry! Even if you don't meet the requirements for gaining too much weight, keeping an eye on your weight throughout pregnancy will help reduce the amount of water you consume so you don't become dehydrated.\r

\r

What causes cramps during pregnancy? Complete Answer: Cramping can be caused by many factors, but it's usually caused by hormonal changes as well as physical changes. A woman's menstrual cycle often sets off a chain of events where hormones trigger contractions in the uterus. These contractions may lead to crampy periods or even menstrual bleeding. If you're experiencing cramping in your second or third trimester, check out our article ""What Causes Pregnancy Cramps?""\r

\r

What are signs of preterm labor in early pregnancy? Complete Answer: Early pregnancy can also signal preterm labor. Preterm labor occurs when the fetus does not develop enough muscle strength to move through the birth canal before 24 weeks, which is around week 28 to 32 of pregnancy. This means that the baby's head cannot turn inside its mother's womb without assistance from her lungs and abdominal muscles. By then, the cervix has dilated and the baby's head can pass through it easily. When this happens, you'll notice swelling of the cervix and sometimes pain with passing the baby. Also known as cervical insufficiency or fetal distress, preterm labor is less common in first pregnancies than it is later in their lives. It doesn't mean the baby isn't growing normally or will die soon, though. Premature babies need specialized care in order to survive after they're born.

However, if you work in a health care setting you may find yourself dealing with the same issues that others do which can lead to some of the same frustrations. As with most occupations, there are people who have MS, but they do not experience significant physical symptoms or disability, so this is more a question of social stigma than any real danger. The fact remains that MS is a chronic illness, however, there are treatments available that offer hope for those who do experience symptoms (such as lowering your blood pressure). It is also important to remember that MS is just one type of autoimmune disease and has little impact on other diseases that may affect the body. In reality, the majority of people with MS continue working their full time job after diagnosis.\r

Q: I am interested in becoming a physician assistant. What specific training should I receive?\r

Answer: You will need to attend either a four year undergraduate degree program at a U.S. accredited college or university, or two years of graduate school in medical science from a U.S. approved institution such as Harvard Medical School, Johns Hopkins University, Stanford University or Vanderbilt University. There is no particular sequence for how long this requirement is required since there are many paths towards the goal. While studying in medical school is certainly beneficial in itself, you'll want to make sure you're well prepared when applying to residency programs. A master's degree is usually considered the minimum standard for being accepted into these programs. Residency programs typically look at a variety of factors including experience, education, specialty, license and experience under supervision.\r

\r

Q: What skills should I develop before going to residency program?\r

Answer: During residency training, you will be expected to become proficient in various clinical areas through study and practice. These include: surgery, psychiatry, internal medicine, emergency room management, pediatrics and pediatric cardiology. Most programs require several hours of theoretical instruction and practical experience during each internship and resident rotations. Many programs offer continuing education classes and laboratory experiences throughout the duration of the program, along with continuing education workshops. Most programs provide assistance in finding employment once you graduate as well. Some programs even have scholarships available to help pay tuition costs.

\tQuestion: what is croup? \m/ Complete Answer: \""Croup\"" occurs when a person with asthma gets more than one attack per day from allergies to their own breathing fluid (exhalation). They also react when they are exposed to certain bacteria that live in the air. These types of reactions can cause severe lung inflammation called \""coughing attacks\"" (or \""chronic coughs\""). A child's first bout usually lasts 2 - 3 days. Symptoms are often mild, but may include wheezing, coughing up blood, shortness of breath and chest discomfort. Croup tends to be more frequent during the hot weather months and peak at school holidays.\r

Your doctor will examine you at a hospital or clinic for a physical exam, lab tests, and any required laboratory work. A psychiatric evaluation must also take place before you can receive treatment under the guidelines set forth by the American Psychiatric Association. The examination should provide an accurate assessment of your current condition and its relationship to any prior diagnoses or past behavior patterns. The evaluation should include the use of standard screening tools and patient history records in order to assess whether your symptoms indicate a diagnosis or reflect previous episodes of depression, mania, psychosis, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, panic attacks, drug dependence, self injury, eating disorders, sleep apnea, sexual dysfunction, hypochondriasis, or another serious mental health problem.

BPD is an emotional disturbance that includes five subtypes: 1) Bipolar II; 2) Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD); 3) Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD); 4) Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). The DSM-IV-TR lists two additional disorders in the category of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD):\t Narcissistic Personality Disorder with Pathological Narcissism and Psychopathy. The two additional disorders described as NPD or ASPD may be considered separate subgroups within BPD. While the diagnosis of BPD must involve at least one of these other diagnoses, people who meet criteria for both the other subtype of BPD and ASPD can still develop BPD in combination with their other diagnoses.\nQuestion: borderline personality disorder treatment\nAnswer: Treatment has varied depending on the level of impairment in functioning and whether there have been past psychiatric hospitalizations, medication usage, or alcohol abuse problems. Some people receive outpatient psychotherapy in which they meet individually with a clinical professional (psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, etc.) and learn coping skills, modify their behavior patterns (e.g., stop drinking), and/or make changes in their relationships (e.g., get married/divorce/separate). Other people undergo intensive inpatient treatments, where the goal is to bring symptoms under control so that they do not relapse during an extended period of time. The goal is usually to allow recovery while allowing some degree of independence from the therapist. Patients often return home after completing the program after several weeks, although others may remain hospitalized indefinitely until the condition improves.\nQuestion: what causes borderline personality disorder?\nAnswer: BPD affects approximately 4%-10% of the general population, but it can affect anyone, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. It generally does not appear before puberty in most children, but its presence may surface more frequently if a child experiences severe trauma or neglect. In addition, people with borderline personality disorder often take on the role of caregiver when they were younger than expected because their feelings of detachment caused them to lose interest in activities that required social interaction such as school or work.\nQuestion: how do you treat borderline personality disorder?\nAnswer: Treatments vary by individual patient's needs, but clinicians will try to minimize stressors so that patients can focus on improving quality of life. An important part of care involves providing information about the disorder, helping",114,borderline personality disorder symptoms,-1.146653175354004,30,multimedqa,1,0.2777777777777778,371,22
gpt2-xl_85,"This disease is characterized by the presence of two distinct protein deposits on immune cells in the brain that lead to chronic inflammation and symptoms. The first type of lesion is called an autoantibody; it's present in both white blood cells and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (also known as the spinal fluid). These antibodies trigger inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), which leads to relapses, disability, loss of function, or death.


The second type of autoimmune attack is called an autoimmunity; this one manifests itself in the body by triggering a reaction against specific proteins in the body called complement molecules. When these molecules bind to the surface of CD4+ T cell receptors, they induce the cells to attack other target cells. Autoimmunity causes symptoms such as rashes and fatigue. \nQuestion: Can I be allergic to peanuts?\nAnswer: Most likely not. It has been reported that some people who eat peanut butter develop an allergy to peanuts. However, there are no published scientific studies proving allergies to peanuts.


Although allergies can occur after consuming foods containing nuts (including peanuts), they rarely cause severe problems for most individuals. In general, food allergies only affect about 1 out of every 100 children with peanut allergies.\nQuestion: How does the thyroid work?\nAnswer: The thyroid gland, located at the base of your neck near your Adam's apple, produces hormones that regulate metabolism, mood, sexual development, and energy levels.\nQuestion: What is the difference between sex hormones, female sex hormones, and male sex hormones?\nAnswer: Hormones produced by the pituitary gland, also referred to as the ""female"" hormone system, control the functioning of reproductive organs like ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, clitoris, vagina, and penis. Hormone production in females results from the release of oestrogen into the bloodstream. Oestrogens are responsible for regulating menstruation and growth of breast tissue, among other things. They also play a role in regulating body temperature and promoting healthy hair growth and skin pigmentation. Male sex hormones, or testosterone, make you grow facial hair, build muscle mass, produce semen, and improve memory. If you have had surgery or taken medication for any reason, you may be taking synthetic versions of female hormones, usually derived from soybeans, as well as male hormones, mostly derived from testosterone. Some medications are designed to counteract the effects of male sex hormones such as estrogen.",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-12.56431770324707,176,multimedqa,1,0.8934010152284264,385,0
gpt2-xl_123,"Hypothyroidism is caused by the thyroid hormone, T3 (triiodothyronine). The body produces enough of this hormone, however, if your body needs more T4 (thyroxine), it takes T3 from the bloodstream or makes it itself. The body can only make so much of any one chemical at one time. If you take too little of a particular chemical in small amounts, that excess chemical builds up in your blood stream and causes problems with your heart and other organs. Too much of some chemicals will cause the same effect as not enough of them. Many people who have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism experience side effects including fatigue, depression, weight gain, constipation, dry skin, cold hands and feet, diarrhea, hair loss, irregular heartbeat, swelling in your ankles and wrists, low mood and increased irritability. It's important to understand how these may affect your overall well-being, as they can interfere with your ability to function. Your doctor can talk to you about what you need to do to keep your levels normal, but most people should be able to address their own symptoms by following these steps: Drink plenty of water and eat a balanced diet.

Avoid overdoing exercise and alcohol. Alcohol can increase the production of the liver enzyme ALT (alanine aminotransferase) that helps turn T4 into T3 and prevent your body from converting T3 back to T4.

Eat foods high in magnesium which promotes healthy metabolism and muscle growth.

Get plenty of sleep at night. As your adrenal glands release cortisol, a stress hormone, it stimulates your pituitary gland to produce thyroxine which then acts like a pump on your thyroid. This process prevents the conversion of T4 to T3 and keeps your thyroid producing natural thyroid hormones. \nExpert Answer: What would you say the average patient looks for when evaluating a physician?


Answer: I think people want the best information possible. That means understanding what they're looking for, what their options are, and why those choices might be made. They also want a clear explanation of potential risks before making a decision about care, whether that's physical, emotional, financial, etc. These questions are really aimed at helping patients get past that initial level of uncertainty and focus on getting good, relevant information from a physician who understands their situation.

This is why they require replacement every few years; even after you buy them new, they can still get smudged.\nQuestion: How do I avoid wrinkles on my face? Complete Answer: Your skin is made up of 50% water, 30% oil, and 10% protein. You have two types of cells (keratinocytes) in your skin that act like little rubber bands around the outside of each strand of hair or skin cells. If you touch your forehead, neck, shoulders, arms, chest, back, hands, knees, buttocks, etc., you will notice the difference between the texture and tone of your skin. Your skin also produces chemicals called prostaglandins which can cause acne as well as other conditions such as dry eyes, headaches, fever, joint pain, colds, flu, sore throats and toothaches. You may be surprised to learn that there is more than one type of bacteria living on your body. These germs help keep us healthy, but they are dangerous if left untreated. A single bacterial infection (the ""big one"") is usually treated with antibiotics. However, antibiotics are toxic to our intestinal tract and we lose important nutrients when we take them.\nQuestion: how much vitamin C can I get per day? Complete Answer: Vitamin C helps prevent scurvy. Scurvy was once known as ""vitamin d"" because it prevented people from getting enough vitamin D. In the past, most of the world did not eat vegetables, fruits, meat, fish or shellfish because they were too costly. Today, however, these foods are readily available and cheap. Even though many Americans don't know what vitamin D is, it is essential to their health. It is often incorrectly referred to as the sunshine vitamin instead of vitamin c.\nQuestion: I just had my baby! What should I expect to see as he grows up?

It also plays an essential part in preventing many other chronic conditions including depression, obesity, and even Alzheimer disease (Alzheimer's).\rQuestion: What is sleep apnea and how does it affect my brain? \rComplete Answer: Sleep apnea occurs when air gets trapped in your throat while breathing during sleep due to decreased oxygen flow from your lungs through narrowed bronchial tubes and blocked airways. This results in shortness of breath, which is commonly referred to as ""snoring"" or ""bronching."" When this happens on its own without causing any other problem with breathing, a person usually becomes aware of snoring at least once every night. While some people don't notice snoring until they're older, most children begin noticing snoring by age two. Many doctors will suggest monitoring the sound of the snore to determine whether there is a respiratory or sleep disorder at work. Some types of sleep disorders include obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, insomnia, and narcolepsy. \rQuestion: Is it possible to get too much salt? \rComplete Answer: A diet high in sodium may lead to a number of health problems, but particularly heart disease. For example, too much sodium can increase blood pressure, increase triglycerides, raise cholesterol, and reduce potassium levels.

Answer: why do I need a doctor when I'm pregnant?\nAnswer: To help protect your baby's health from illness. A doctor provides necessary medical care, even in an emergency. If you decide that continuing breastfeeding or bottle feeding isn't right for you, ask your provider if she or he has any specific recommendations about which type of care may be best for you during pregnancy.

Answer: How does breastfeeding work?\nAnswer: As long as both breastmilk recipients share some milk, they develop a healthy bond between them. The mother gets lots of benefits by having her milk available to her babies. But here are a few reasons why parents choose not to use formula when it comes to breastfeeding:\n 1) Formula companies don't disclose ingredients (they claim they're ""all natural"") 2) Formula doesn't have enough nutrients for babies 3) Formula contains chemicals that can harm a baby's immune system 4) Babies' digestive systems get used up more quickly than human infants 5) Breastfeeding requires time to learn new skills 6) There is no scientific evidence that infant formula helps reduce ear infections (more info below!) 7) Formula manufacturers are using deceptive marketing tactics 8) Most women who try to breastfeed are disappointed 9) Some mothers simply cannot produce enough milk to feed all their babies at once 10) Some moms find formula too expensive 11) Some formula formulas contain harmful chemicals 12) Breastfeeding takes patience 13) Some people don't like the taste of cow's milk 14) Some mothers feel uncomfortable nursing other children while breastfeeding 15) Formula often causes constipation 16) It can take a month or longer before a woman's breasts start producing regular amounts of milk 17) Nursing mothers can become tired because of the length of time needed to make enough milk 18) Formula should only be prescribed after careful testing shows that there is no alternative remedy for your child's symptoms 19) You can drink bottled water instead of formula 20) Avoiding certain foods is better than avoiding other food groups 21) Injectable medicines can cause dangerous side effects 22) Mothers shouldn't rely solely on oral medications 23) Women who don't breastfeed aren't necessarily less intelligent 24) Your body produces hormones during lactation 25) Milk production slows significantly during menop",57,multiple sclerosis stages phases,-12.50464916229248,148,multimedqa,1,0.714975845410628,419,4

People with MS have difficulty with daily tasks such as walking and standing. They also experience more severe headaches at night. In addition, there are symptoms of depression, fatigue, and muscle weakness. The majority of MS patients report that they feel as if they can't do anything right. Some people who suffer from MS have milder symptoms than others, so it's important for you to understand what these symptoms may be.\rAnswer 2: \fMultiple sclerosis (MS) occurs when the immune system attacks the central nervous system. This damages nerve cells throughout the body. Symptoms include pain in the arms or legs, numbness, tingling sensations, changes in vision, hearing, balance, memory, concentration, behavior, speech, sexual function, bowel/urinary control, bladder control, bowel movements, and skin. If untreated, MS progresses rapidly. About 3% to 6% of those with MS develop progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which means their muscles die due to lack of oxygen supplied by blood flow. It doesn't seem to affect many other parts of the body, but some individuals live with the disease even after several months.\rAnswer 3:\fThe most common form of MS (milder forms exist) is chronic plaque psoriasis, which is characterized by red patches on the scalp, hands, feet, armpits, groin, trunk, or limbs. There may be small blisters, crusts, or ulcers around the lesions. The spots usually respond well to anti-inflammatory medications, such as aspirin. However, there are very few treatments available for the less common, more serious forms of MS called relapsing remitting MS (RRMS). These are conditions where the condition gets worse without improvement in the quality of life. Treatment involves medication and surgery, which sometimes result in permanent disability.

What Are The Signs And Symptoms Of MS?


In an ideal world, everyone would find out the cause of MS before the onset of any physical problem -- whether it was a broken bone, or arthritis, or bad back pain. But this isn't always possible, and we can only guess at why someone might get it.

Your children are more likely than their siblings or parents to have another parent with MS. However, if your second child had MS and they were born before 1995 and there are any current relatives who also have the disease (and these relatives would not be affected by your symptoms), it's possible that those relatives will have MS. If this happens, your son may develop the disease but then he or she won't need treatment because he or she has no active disease.

Prostate cancer occurs when these proteins become too much concentrated, resulting in abnormal cell growth and invasion.

Obesity has many serious negative effects on your health including increased risk for heart disease, diabetes, stroke, cancer and even death. Overweight people also tend to live shorter lives than their normal weight counterparts. \nQuestion: What is the difference between estrogen and testosterone?\nAnswer: Estrogen is an estrogen receptor positive (ER+) hormone. Testosterone is a male sex hormone with no estrogen receptor. Therefore, estrogen is not used by either the ovaries or the uterus to create eggs or sperm. They are both important hormones that allow the human body to create new cells for the production of tissue such as bone, muscle, skin, hair, cartilage, organs and fluids. Some women need more estrogen so they don't get breast cancer; some men need more testosterone because the testes produce more testosterone; others may benefit from the opposite. This hormone balance can affect everyone differently. \nQuestion: I've heard that there's something called a ""female factor"" that affects whether we have periods. Is this true?\nAnswer: Many people believe that menstruation starts only after puberty and then stops completely at age 50. But research suggests that menstrual cycles start early in life and continue throughout life. Research shows that 90% of women have regular monthly periods throughout their lifetime. There are various reasons why menstruating might stop earlier or later for certain women but the majority do. Although the exact causes remain unknown, one theory is that our immune system changes around the time we reach puberty. At this point, most girls' immune systems begin fighting off infections more effectively so they aren't exposed to as many germs during their first period and start losing interest in them as well. If this happens, women could see their periods drop off more quickly than usual. This is often referred to as ""period denial."" \nQuestion: My doctor said I'm supposed to take calcium daily.

Answer: Acne is the most common skin disease in adults age 18 years or older. If you have had an allergic reaction to your medication or if you are sensitive to certain ingredients of medications, it may cause breakouts or other symptoms that look like acne on your face. Acne can be caused by many different things, such as stress, diet, physical activity, smoking, pollution, hormones, viruses, and other environmental factors. It may also develop suddenly or persist even after the initial incident has passed. The severity of acne varies from person to person. However, some people with mild acne problems often use topical steroids (such as tretinoin) when they notice their problem worsening. Other people who have severe cases of acne require prescription treatment for their condition. Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics or other medicines that treat acne without causing side effects. Acne affects 1 in every 6 people over the age of 20. Many other conditions can cause similar symptoms, so ask your doctor about possible causes if you don't know what's wrong.\n\ nAcne usually starts between ages 15 to 30 years, but sometimes occurs at any time during this period.

Q How do I check my level of vitamin D? Complete Answer: Vitamin D plays a role in calcium metabolism. Calcium absorption depends upon sun exposure and regular intake of dairy products, fish, and seafood. For optimal calcium absorption, adults need 600 IU (international units) per day. Children need 400 IU/day. To measure blood levels of vitamin D, you'll want to absorb a small amount of saliva, which will give a more accurate reading than taking a vitamin D supplement. Ask your dentist where you can get a urine sample from your mouth. Use the results to determine whether your saliva contains enough vitamin D to test for and then add back into your diet.\r

Symptoms such as these should be monitored closely by your doctor or oncologist. If you notice any changes in your symptoms or quality of life after you become ill, consult your physician.\nAnswer: How do I know if my cancer has spread?

A) Your doctor may ask to see results from a chest X-ray of your lungs, but this is not an accurate way of determining whether your cancer has spread or not. Results from this test indicate where the cancer began rather than where it's been since you were first diagnosed. A radiographic scan may show a small spot of cancer on one side of your lungs, for example, but it won't tell whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, muscles or bones, or elsewhere in your body. \nB) A chest CT or MRI may reveal signs of cancerous cells or tumors in your lungs, which are then examined under an electron microscope. This scan provides an image of a tumor that contains more detail than a normal X-ray, and it reveals details like growths or nodules that are too minute to be seen using a plain X-ray. The same goes for PET scans, which use radioactive tracers to detect tiny amounts of cancer cells that could otherwise escape detection. \nC) Blood tests show how much cancer there is in your blood cells, called leukocytes. Leukocytes are white blood cells that help fight infection. They also transport oxygen throughout the bloodstream.\nD) Radiotherapy is used to shrink the large clusters of abnormal white blood cells that form around or near tumor sites.

The swelling may be localized to one particular part of your body, or it may affect many different areas simultaneously.\nQuestion: What are the symptoms of heavy bleeding?\nAnswer: Heavy bleeding is a painful condition that can happen when blood clots form within the veins, arteries, or capillaries of your heart, lungs, or brain. This condition usually happens when you have had a heart attack, but some people also experience this symptom after having surgery on their heart, lung, liver, or other organ. Your doctor will probably tell you which areas of your body might be affected by heavy bleeding, and then instruct you on how best to care for yourself during heavy bleedings. If you're concerned about your own heavy bleeding, seek immediate emergency medical treatment. Complete Answer: \nBlood clotting disorder occurs when the blood vessels (vascular system), such as those in the veins, arteries, or capillaries, become inflamed due to accumulation of thickened plasma cells called platelets.\nMost commonly, severe bleeding from these areas causes rapid pressure changes inside the blood vessel walls resulting in tissue damage and pain. However, even minor bleeds can cause significant discomfort and potentially fatal internal injuries. Most important, heavy bleeding affects the entire cardiovascular system, so it can lead to pulmonary embolism and stroke.\r

Some ways to treat heavy bleeding include:

Injecting fluids into the deep veins of the legs, buttocks, or ankles to reduce swelling. These fluids should not contain aspirin or other medications to prevent bleeding. Taking anticoagulants such as warfarin or heparin. Taking calcium supplements if you have high levels of sodium (salt). Taking paracetamol (Vicodin) or ibuprofen (Advil) to relieve pain and ease nausea caused by bleeding.

The results of these studies are encouraging to say the least. If we look at what's been accomplished so far in the field of nutrition science and nutrition information dissemination, it becomes evident that there are many possibilities available when it comes to improving health. But when it comes to providing consumers with accurate, relevant information on the topics of nutrition, they seem to be stuck in a rut. This doesn't mean that everything isn't possible, but it means that finding out what works is often a struggle and that new tools are needed to help make things happen.

A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) indicates some major problems that need to be addressed if we are to improve our ability to provide meaningful nutrition information. The study was conducted by researchers from Harvard School of Public Health and published in JAMA Internal Medicine. One of the main findings is that nutritional information provided to the public is not only inaccurate, but it also lacks any real scientific validity.

One of the big areas where this problem exists is in the area of healthy eating. Many people believe that foods containing ""bad"" fats or proteins cause heart disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity and other chronic diseases. However, all three of these conditions are caused by different factors, including genetics and environmental influences. A good example of the disconnect between public perception and reality is found in the fact that Americans consume more saturated fat than ever before. However, the truth is that this increase is due to increasing demand, not because Americans are consuming less saturated fat. As a result, this increased intake of saturated fat doesn't translate into greater cardiovascular risk. It just means that people are getting more saturated",96,most efficient and sustainable diets,-10.911181449890137,17,multimedqa,1,0.18888888888888888,404,7

gpt2-xl_45,"Diabetes is a chronic disease caused by an imbalance of two or more hormones (insulin) that control the body's use of glucose as fuel. One of those hormones is insulin; your pancreas produces this hormone in response to food. When you do not receive enough insulin from foods, such as sugars, grains, dairy products, legumes, or other processed carbohydrates, blood sugar levels can rise too high, triggering uncontrolled blood flow to tissues, which can cause serious damage. \nQuestion: How old should I start taking my anticoagulant drug if I have type 1 diabetes?\nAnswer: Your doctor will evaluate whether you have had any complications related to treatment with an antiplatelet medication before prescribing it for you. However, your treatment with an antiplatelet medication does NOT protect against heart attack, stroke, death from cardiovascular causes or other types of fatal vascular events. There is no evidence that long term use of the same anticoagulant medication has improved overall survival rates among patients with type 1 diabetes. If you are diagnosed with a condition that requires medicine (other than an anticoagulant), your physician may prescribe you medicines that contain an anticoagulant drug (such as warfarin). If you need medication, talk with your doctor about what kind of therapy would best suit your needs. \nQuestions: What is the effect of diet on my risk of having a heart attack or stroke?\nComplete Answer: A healthy lifestyle is extremely important to help prevent heart disease and stroke, but diet alone cannot completely eliminate these risks. Smoking increases your risk, as does being overweight. You also increase your risk if you eat too much red meat, salt, fat, and refined sugars. The American Heart Association recommends eating less than 200 grams (8 ounces) of total calories each day. This means, for example, that you don't eat more than 2,000 calories per day of added sugars, fats, and saturated fats. For most people, this guideline translates into fewer than 2,500 daily calories of added sugars, fats, and saturated fats. In addition, some experts recommend avoiding foods high in sodium, trans fatty acids, and added sugar at least until age 50. \nWhat are the signs and symptoms of anemia?\nAnswer: Anemia is an abnormality of the amount and quality of red blood cells.

These include avoiding those foods or drinks that cause discomfort, drinking plenty of fluids (especially if you're in hot weather), taking vitamin supplements, exercising, eating healthy meals, and staying away from heat and strenuous activity until at least an hour before bedtime.\nQuestions: How much sleep should I get each night?\nAnswer: It's important to get adequate amounts of rest during the day when your body produces a normal amount of energy. Sleep deprivation can interfere with your ability to concentrate. A regular sleep pattern also helps keep your heart rate down, improve immune function, and protect against cancer and other diseases.\nWhat are the symptoms of hypoglycemia?\nAnswer: Hypoglycemia is a temporary low in blood sugar level due to insufficient insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. The symptoms typically appear 2-3 days after food consumption. Some people develop symptoms sooner than others. In general, they include: weakness

tired feeling

irritability/belligerence

Both types have different causes. Low LDL represents the amount of cholesterol in your blood while high HDL shows how much of the cholesterol in your blood is carried by healthy cells called HDL. High LDL can be caused by obesity or other conditions that damage arteries. Low HDL indicates that the good cholesterol is not being carried by healthy cells. A normal level of both of these is considered to be within normal limits.

This test will determine the amount of fat in your bloodstream and can help accurately estimate your potential coronary artery disease risk. It is important to note that your doctor may ask you to provide additional blood samples during the course of his examination if he suspects you may be experiencing symptoms of vascular disease. If any of these tests are abnormal, they should prompt further discussion with your doctor and treatment.\rAnswer: cholesterol calculator\nComplete Answer: Calculate your cholesterol content with our simple online cholesterol calculator.\r

Answer: Menopause can affect any woman who has had regular periods for at least 12 months. However, it's more likely if you've been menstruating regularly for at least four years (although some women may be able to get through even longer without any problem). The main symptoms of menopause include hot flashes, mood swings, hair loss, fatigue, vaginal dryness, and sexual dysfunction. The most important thing to remember during menopause is to make sure your vitamin D levels remain high enough. This will help prevent osteopenia, bone fragility, and other complications associated with low calcium levels. If you're currently taking oral contraceptives, you need to take a multivitamin containing all nine B-vitamins as well as iron. It can reduce your chances of developing breast cancer by 60%.

Q: I'm pregnant and have never heard of PMS. What does that mean?\r

A: Many people assume PMS is caused by stress related to pregnancy. When we think about it though, what's really stressing out us are our bodies' demands for energy. Women produce less estrogen than they used to after having children. While these changes may seem to lessen our symptoms, there's a difference between feeling tired and actually getting sick from being on too little sleep. You should always eat nutritious meals, drink plenty of water and try not to smoke while expecting. \r

Q: Is my menstrual cycle abnormal?\r

A: Yes, but that doesn't necessarily mean you're pregnant. Your period occurs only once every 28 days. So, if you haven't started bleeding yet, you probably aren't pregnant.

The amount of hormones needed each day depends upon how active you are, which varies greatly from person to person. When you stop taking your hormones, your body goes through what is called a reabsorption process. Once this process is finished, your level of hormones will return back to normal.

Complete Answer: We know that brain cells need glucose in order to function properly. Ketones provide a lot of the fuel required by brain cells for energy.

gpt2-xl_97,"There is no one answer for how much physical activity you should do, but there are several important things to keep in mind. First, it depends on your age. Some children can get enough exercise without any problem; older adults need more than others. Next, it also depends on the kind of exercise you do. For example, walking briskly at an easy pace makes good sense for kids who are just learning to walk. But if you have arthritis or other problems that make walking difficult, consider biking, running, swimming, skating, or a combination of those activities. Finally, even when you're exercising vigorously, it's still important to take time off every now and then.

Answer: How often does alcohol interfere with my thyroid function?\nAnswer: Alcohol can affect your thyroid function by inhibiting production of thyroid hormone by the pituitary gland. Acetaldehyde (the main metabolite of alcohol) also inhibits thyroid hormone metabolism. This may lead to hypothyroidism, which refers to a condition where thyroxine (T4), the body's most active form of thyroid hormone, is too low. However, there isn't any proof that excessive drinking leads to hypothyroidism. It could be caused by other factors such as aging and stress, or it may not happen at all. The only way to know for sure whether you have hypothyroidism is through a blood test called TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone). \nHow often does exposure to heavy metals interfere with my thyroid function?\nAnswer: Heavy metal poisoning from dental fillings or mercury from amalgam fillings is a cause of hypothyroidism. It usually starts out slowly (often in your 40s or 50s) and eventually becomes severe. Sometimes the symptoms don't appear until after you've been poisoned. Once you develop these symptoms, you should see your doctor. Your doctor will probably order additional tests, including a complete blood count (CBC) and urine tests to check for other possible underlying causes. While there's no evidence that excess mercury exposure directly affects thyroid function, the amount absorbed by the digestive system might increase your risk of developing hypothyroidism. The best approach would be to limit your intake of mercury and any types of fillings containing amalgam.

gpt2-xl_132,"The answer to your question is that there are several types of psoriasis that occur in people, including psoriasis vulgaris (PSV), psoriatic arthritis (PA) or psoriasis with erythema migrans (PM). Some people have more than one type of psoriasis and may also experience other skin conditions such as eczema, vitiligo and acne. Psoriasis can affect nearly everyone at some point in their lives, but it's best known for affecting those who live in the tropics, especially those who are obese. It can cause large amounts of inflammation on the skin, leading to thickened and red skin that often looks like it has been burnt. Other symptoms include blisters, peeling sores on the lips, hair loss, itchiness and joint pain and stiffness. Your doctor will first look to see if you have any physical causes for your psoriasis before deciding whether to treat it with medication. If you do have a physical cause for your condition then your doctor will take this into consideration when treating your psoriasis.\rQuestion: I've got psoriasis on my face and neck. How does psoriasis make me look?\rAnswer: There are two main ways in which psoriasis makes an individual appear 'different' from others. First, psoriasis can create a large number of small red bumps called plaques on the skin, usually on the cheeks, chin, upper back and shoulders. These plaques are caused by bacteria (called Propionibacterium acnes) which produce oil, causing them to form over time. Second, psoriasis can cause scaly patches that may be red or pink and sometimes resemble the scales of a fish. While psoriasis can lead to these facial effects, it can also result in severe skin problems throughout the body. For example, psoriasis can lead to chronic dry skin, dry eye bags and even cancer (this last finding is rare, though). In addition to these visual issues, psoriasis affects many parts of the body negatively. This includes the joints, tendons and ligaments (especially in the knees and elbows), lungs, kidneys and digestive system. All of these systems become inflamed from the psoriasis and may require treatment to prevent further damage.\rQuestion: What should I expect after I get psoriasis? \r

If the cause is unknown or untreated (not being diagnosed until after the disease has progressed), treatments may not stop the progression of the disease. As an example, some people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis need to take more corticosteroid medications during their initial months of therapy in order to achieve remission. In this case, the number of medications may eventually decrease as the disease becomes controlled or when the underlying cause is identified and treated.\nHow do I treat multiple sclerosis that isn't progressing?\nComplete Answer: Treatments typically begin when there are no signs of the disease spreading. In such cases, corticosteroids may still be necessary to reduce swelling.

the severity of your symptoms;

your overall health status;

and whether or not other medical conditions exist that could exacerbate your MS symptoms.

All you have to do is install anti-virus software to get rid of all these viruses. When you update the software to fix the problem, it will ask you whether you would like to save your personal files and documents.

If you have heartburn, it will usually go away after eating a meal containing fiber. But if it persists, visit your doctor because there may be an underlying condition causing your heartburn. \rQuestion: What is polyps?\nAnswer: Polyps are small growths which contain abnormal cells and tissue inside them. They can grow very large in size and sometimes cause severe discomfort to those who harbor them. When they get larger than five centimeters in diameter, they can cause inflammation and bleeding around the anus. They also increase the risk of developing cancer. Polyps can grow easily in certain areas of the body due to poor digestion. In addition, if they become infected with bacteria, they can produce pus, make it difficult for you to pass stool, and even damage your colon lining. They do not need to be removed by surgery; however, if left untreated they can become dangerous and lead to more serious conditions. \rQuestion: How much calcium should I take daily?\nAnswer: Calcium, also known as salt, is one of four essential minerals needed by humans for good bone formation, strong bones, muscle function, proper nerve transmission, and maintaining healthy teeth. In addition, it helps maintain the muscles necessary to move food through the gastrointestinal tract efficiently. Daily consumption of calcium is important for women of childbearing age and adolescents. Most people consume too little calcium, especially those who eat foods high in sodium, sugar, flour, refined grains, and alcohol. Too much dairy products contains excessive amounts of calcium. Also, many people are deficient in vitamin D because sunlight exposure does not provide sufficient levels. Vitamin D deficiency often leads to rickets, osteomalacia, softening of the bones, and weak arms and legs. Many people who regularly drink beer, wine, or other alcoholic beverages, lack enough vitamin B12.

Q&A: Multiple Sclerosis\u2014Health Finder® - How Does It Affect Your Careers?\u0026amp; Question: What is the risk of being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis later in life?\u0026amp; Complete Answer: You can expect an average lifespan of approximately 85 years if you do not develop any symptoms before your early 40s. If you develop signs or symptoms of MS, however, you could live significantly longer. In terms of potential mortality rates, it is estimated that 1-2% of those affected will eventually die within 10 years of diagnosis. However, many studies suggest that it takes 3-5 years for MS lesions to appear clinically. For this reason, there is no evidence suggesting that MS affects long term survival in the general population.\r

Q&A: What About My Child With MS?\u0026amp; Complete Answer: Many children who suffer from MS experience difficulty learning and making daily living tasks. Therefore, we advise parents against driving their child or young adult to school or attending activities or sports until they have been assessed by a doctor. The time frame between initial onset of symptoms (before age 15) and diagnosis varies depending on the underlying cause of MS. For example, some sufferers present with early signs of MS, but do not show any symptoms until much later. This period is known as prodrome. Others present with no early signs of MS, but do show some clinical progression after the first year of illness. However, these individuals usually continue to be able to go outside unassisted after several months.\r

In recent studies, the rate of Alzheimer's disease among individuals who have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis has doubled over 10 years.\r

Multiple sclerosis is not contagious and cannot spread from person to person; however, it can affect the brain and spinal cord of someone else.\r

To answer your question more completely, you should ask yourself if you've suffered from any neurological disorders such as stroke or Parkinson's disease. You also need to consider your personal history: if you were exposed to a virus or bacteria at some time, could this have caused the development of MS? If so, how much time after the exposure did the illness develop?\r

If you think you might have developed MS during your teenage years (between ages 14 – 18), remember that even though there is no evidence of an association between MS and your teenage years, research suggests that it is possible that having one early onset of MS before adulthood may increase the risk of later relapses when you're older. It doesn't mean that you will get MS each time you experience a relapse, but researchers estimate that the odds of getting another relapse are higher than the average risk for all adults with a first episode of MS. \r

If you've already experienced three relapses of MS within four months, it's probably best to take steps now to prevent future relapses by taking anti-MS medications.\r

It's important to talk to your doctor before seeking out information on genetic testing because most people don't know their genes. A blood test can tell you if you carry a gene mutation associated with MS (polymorphism) called APOE4, which occurs in approximately 1% of Caucasian males and 2% of Caucasians females. The presence of APOE4 means you'll be at an increased risk of developing MS. In addition, APOE4 is one of two major candidate genes currently being studied in connection with MS. The other is EPAS1, also known as the EPAS gene.

Additionally, it is important to understand how your symptoms relate to each other so that you can develop strategies for managing them. To help you better understand mental health issues, we've provided a list below that highlights different types of mental health conditions.

People who suffer from generalized anxiety disorder, however, often also experience panic attacks \nDepression has both psychological and physiological components. Psychological (depressive) symptoms typically stem from biological disturbances such as neurotransmitter imbalances, brain chemistry abnormalities, hormonal imbalances, genetics, environmental factors, or medication side effects. Physiological causes, including lack of sleep, exercise, dieting, alcohol abuse, and exposure to toxic substances can contribute to depressive symptomatology. Some individuals are predisposed toward depression because they have inherited genetic mutations that impair their ability to cope with stress and other stresses and strains. Common antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), work by increasing levels of serotonin in the brain. These medications relieve milder forms of depression, whereas SSRI drugs are effective for severe cases of depression. They may also help prevent relapse after acute episodes of depression.\r

gpt2-xl_51,"Wellness encompasses a wide range of practices which aim to improve the individual's overall quality of life by addressing issues such as physical, emotional, mental, spiritual, social, and environmental factors that impact on health and well-being. While traditional physicians would focus primarily on disease symptoms and treatments (e.g., cancer treatment), modern practitioners can also provide a broader view of wellness, including eating for optimal nutrition, stress management, relaxation techniques, meditation, and other therapies in addition to standard care. In this way, healthcare providers are able to create an integrated approach where illness or conditions are not only treated but addressed at the same time as their underlying causes. This holistic perspective has been proven effective in treating many chronic diseases; however, there are some conditions which have yet to be fully appreciated as being part of a healthy whole. For example, many people do not realize they are suffering from the psychological effects of depression.

When such a person has severe depression, it can sometimes lead to suicidal thoughts and actions. A good way to help your patient cope with this emotionally turbulent phase in life is by helping him/her learn how to regulate his or her emotions so as to avoid excessive thinking (i.e., rumination) and avoid reliving the past.\nAnswer: how does my child get diabetes?\nCompletion: \nDiabetes is a disease caused by excess body glucose in the blood. The kidneys produce hormones that cause the pancreas to secrete more insulin into the bloodstream for use by cells throughout the body. Overproduction of insulin causes the cell membranes surrounding the sugar molecules to become permeable and allows the glucose molecules to enter into the cells where they then bind to sugars on protein receptors on the surface of the cells. Since blood sugar is high and sugar levels in the serum (the liquid part of the blood) are low, cells can't function properly. Hyperglycemia results from cells not receiving enough sugar; hypoglycemia results from insufficient glucose production, resulting in abnormal changes in blood volume and pressure (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide), changes in the metabolism of fats and proteins, and increased excretion of waste products, including carbon dioxide.\nAnswer: how do I tell if my baby's brain is developing normally?\nCompletion: \nBrain development begins when cells divide rapidly from neural tube buds. As these cells grow, they fuse together to form two brains, each containing many brain cells. Brain growth occurs at a rapid rate until around age three or four years old. At that time, most babies lose their ability to walk. It may be necessary to have a second opinion before making any diagnosis of developmental delay.\nAnswer: what should I look out for during labor?\nCompletion: \nAn uncomplicated vaginal delivery usually involves an increase in contractions to assist birth, but some women need more help than others to push off. In general, most healthy pregnant women will experience one or two contractions per hour while trying to deliver their baby (each contraction lasts between 30 seconds and a minute.)

This condition has many different symptoms, which may include throbbing pain in your neck, back, shoulder, arms, hands, legs, feet, or abdomen, sudden shortness of breath, or lightheaded feeling. To prevent high blood pressure from getting worse, avoid excessive alcohol intake, maintain a healthy diet, keep your cholesterol levels down, and exercise regularly. To learn more about high blood pressure, visit http://www.cdc.gov/hypertension/symptoms.htm.\nQuestion: Why did my pet develop cancer?\nAnswer: Cats and dogs become infected with bacteria known as Mycobacterium leprae by eating contaminated food, through contact with other animals who have eaten contaminated meat, or via ingestion of soil or water contaminated with such bacteria. The organism can cause cancer in both cats and dogs. Some types of cancers are relatively easily cured while others require treatment. If your cat or dog develops a skin tumor (tumor of the coat), it can also indicate a potential risk for developing cancer in the future. Certain breeds like Siberian Huskies, Dachshunds, Chow Chows, Pugs, Miniature Schnauzers, Jack Russels, etc., are highly susceptible to this infection. A veterinarian should examine your pet's paw print to look for any signs of infection.\nQuestion: I'm allergic to shellfish - what can I feed my pet?\nAnswer: Many pets love fish! They find them very tasty and delicious and many people believe these small crustaceans are healthy choices for people. In fact, they can actually contain a lot of nutrients without being processed into unhealthy proteins. It's important to choose safe, nutritious seafood that hasn't been treated with chemical additives or preservatives.

gpt2-xl_123,"I can help you understand the condition and what it means for your body and life. You may be wondering whether thyroid problems could affect your ability to work or sleep, or cause weight gain. Your doctor will likely want to check if you have any other underlying medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or stroke that might interfere with your hormone levels. In some cases, a prescription medication may need to be taken to correct an imbalance in the hormones in your body. If you do not know how to answer this question, please contact our Nurse Advisor. \rQuestion: what is hypothyroidism? Complete Answer: Hypothyroidism is one of several disorders caused by overproduction of certain types of thyroid hormones. Thyroid glands produce a hormone called thyroxine (T4) from protein in food like eggs, soybeans, dairy products, and nuts. When too much T4 is produced, the body begins to use up T4 and converts it into thyroid hormone (T3). As the body's production of these two different chemicals increases, they become more effective at converting food into energy. A person who does not get enough iodine or T4 cannot convert their food correctly, which leads to hypothyroidism. This disorder often occurs when people stop consuming foods that contain iodine; it also affects anyone who takes medications containing folic acid or vitamin B12, because the conversion of these nutrients creates similar ""oversupply"" of thyroid hormones.\u00a0\u003c\/p\u003e

\r

Hypothyroidism is most commonly treated using thyroid hormone replacement pills called levothyroxine (generic name: Synthroid), which consists of synthetic versions of three active chemical substances called L-thyroxine, T4, and T3. These drugs should be prescribed regularly to prevent the buildup of excess hormones, leading to low mood and fatigue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow to Take Thyroid Reminder Medications\u003c\/div\u003e\r

\nQuestion: medication cialis insomnia\nAnswer: Cialis was developed as a prescription medicine used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED) but can also be effective at treating insomnia.

\nQuestion: medication cholera \nAnswer: Cholera is caused by the bacteria Vibrio cholerae which can cause diarrhea. The most dangerous form of cholera is called typhoid fever, and it causes severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and dehydration. While the symptoms usually subside on their own within two days, some people who have been infected with cholera develop serious complications including kidney failure and death. Cholera has not been shown to cure or prevent any illness. You should talk to your doctor if you think you've become infected while taking this product. If you were vaccinated against cholera during childhood, talk to your doctor before starting this medication.\nQuestion: medication klonopin cough syrup\nAnswer: This medication is prescribed for use to relieve the symptoms of acute bronchitis or pneumonia. It will help relieve your coughing so you don't feel as bad after a normal cold. Talk to your doctor if you're not sure what the symptoms of these illnesses are.

\nQuestion: medication levothyroxine\nAnswer: Levothyroxine (T4 thyroid hormone replacement therapy) is used to increase the amount of thyroxine (T3) that's produced in your body. It helps regulate the amount of T4 in your blood stream and decrease the amount of T3 in your body. With low levels of T4 and T3, you might experience fatigue, sleep problems, depression, weight gain, and mood swings. However, many medications that act on thyroid function can have side effects including increased cholesterol, higher chance of heart attack, high risk of breast cancer, and mental changes like confusion, aggression, and memory loss. Talk to your doctor before taking levothyroxine if you have any of these conditions.\nQuestion: medication metformin \nAnswer: Metformin is used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance.

gpt2-xl_92,"It is the accumulation of damage over time that can lead to fatigue in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). This buildup occurs when there is an imbalance between two important cell types, myelin and myelination. The result is a breakdown in the protective coating called myelin around nerve fibers. If this protection is not present, the nerves will eventually break down as they travel through your body. In this way, fatigue is caused by both inflammation and degeneration of the nervous system itself.\r

The following questions should help you to identify specific areas of study and research you may be interested in pursuing:\r

\r

Questions: What do scientists know about the disease? Are there things we don't understand? Is it possible to cure or manage the condition? What is the current consensus among doctors that this disease exists? Where does ME/CFS stand in comparison to other diseases? How many people suffer from ME/CFS? Do you think there is any connection between this illness and some foods? Does exposure to certain chemicals cause problems? Do you believe that the illness has a genetic component? Can certain illnesses such as cancer and diabetes actually affect ME/CFS?\r

\r

Answer: Scientists know very little about ME/CFS. However, because our understanding of how the brain processes information is growing rapidly, researchers are learning more and more each year. They're also discovering clues about the biology of the disease. Current theories suggest that the immune system triggers a series of changes in the cells lining the brain that make it feel ""stuck"" - like something isn't right. As those cells become damaged, symptoms appear. Studies indicate that the central nervous system produces excessive amounts of myelin and leads to the neurological symptoms of ME/CFS.

If you are older than 65 years old, you should talk with your healthcare provider before starting any new diet or exercise program and monitor your health closely.

Answer: If I drink alcohol and eat meat, will I get diabetes? Complete answer: You are at higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes if you drink alcoholic beverages and consume meat products. Your risk increases the more you drink and eat meat products. The amount of alcohol that you can safely drink is limited only by how much you weigh. Drinking too much alcohol (more than one drink per day) can increase your chance of getting diabetes by up to 18%. Women who drink more than three drinks per day have a 20% greater chance of getting diabetes than women who limit their drinking to less than 1 drink per day. However, there's no evidence linking alcohol consumption and diabetes. \rAsk an expert: What does it mean to ""drink enough"" to be at risk for diabetes? Answer: For most people, if they drink one or two standard drinks each day (1–2 glasses), they won't get diabetes. Drink more to make sure that you stay within this safe level. \rIf you think you may need to cut down on drinking, ask your healthcare professional whether you should stop drinking alcohol.

gpt2-xl_57,"\NThe first phase of MS is called acute (spontaneous). The second phase is called chronic (in response to an abnormal immune system attack). If your doctor has diagnosed you with stage one MS then there is no treatment for it. Your disease will continue to progress until it's completely gone. Once it's gone, the symptoms will go away on their own. Sometimes they get worse before they go away. For this reason, it is important that you keep up with any medication or treatment plan your doctor may recommend.\nQuestion: my condition improves\nAnswer: This means that the body has begun healing itself from the initial damage caused by the original lesion. In other words, some or all of the inflammation has been eliminated or minimized. Although this does not mean there are no further problems left in your body, it will allow the body to heal more effectively than if the inflammation had continued unchecked. There are several types of treatments available to help reduce the degree of inflammation in people with multiple sclerosis. Each type can be administered in different ways depending upon what the cause is. When it comes to managing pain, some people with MS find relief by using opioid medications. Others feel better without these drugs because they rely on techniques such as acupuncture or massage. Still others try yoga and meditation to manage their pain. Some patients use physical therapy to strengthen muscles around joints damaged by the disease. They also learn to live in compliance with their bodies' natural rhythms in order to prevent recurring episodes of pain. As time goes on, some people with MS have found that medications that relieve the worst symptoms, but don't entirely eliminate them, help them tolerate daily activities. These include the pain relievers celecoxib and diclofenac. Other medications include those used to treat high blood pressure, fibromyalgia, HIV infection, and insomnia. If you experience any difficulty handling daily life tasks, you should discuss with your doctor whether the treatments mentioned above might be able to ease your suffering.

Your doctors have been unable to find a specific cause for it and they suspect that you may be genetically predisposed to developing MS. However, they cannot prove it with laboratory testing. It is quite possible that MS occurs naturally as part of normal aging or that environmental factors can trigger it. In either case, your symptoms will improve when you stop taking the drugs associated with MS and you take other medications that target the same problems in your immune system. Complete Answer: Primary progressive multiple sclerosis\nAnswer: This is also called relapsing-remitting MS. The disease affects people in their 20s through 60s. Symptoms include pain on one side of the body where the nerve root has been severed.

Primary progressive multiple sclerosis, or PPM, is the most severe form of MS. It usually progresses slowly but can strike at any age. Although a person might not notice his or her condition, symptoms can make it hard for family members and friends to understand how the person is doing. Some people feel better after a few months of treatment if they start therapy early enough. For example, people who do not start treatment until later in life need higher doses of steroids and interferon or corticosteroids before they get better. A diagnosis of primary progressive MS should prompt discussions with a doctor about alternative treatments. You may receive chemotherapy along with radiation therapy. These treatments increase risk of cancer, especially bone marrow suppression, and require regular followup visits. The goal of treatment should be lifelong control of symptoms without further disability. If your symptoms return after stopping treatment, consider starting medication again while continuing to see your doctor regularly. An MRI scan can help determine whether the disease's course continues to progress. For more information, contact your doctor and/or visit www.nimh.nih.gov. \m/e/1Ml8OgZfSd3iTQjq9kzWb

MS typically affects one person in every 100,000.\r

MS does not cause sleep problems or forgetfulness in older adults. While there may be several reasons why someone might have poor night-time awakenings while they're asleep (such as sleep apnea or REM disturbance), it's unlikely that these would be caused by MS itself, so the diagnosis should be made on a case-by-case basis. \r

A recent report from a team of researchers led by Dr. Donald B. Miller at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine found evidence of aluminum adjuvant in three vaccines used in Europe during the 1990s, including MMR, rotavirus, and diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis vaccines. This finding suggests possible increased risk of adverse reactions to these vaccines when administered together with other substances containing aluminum.\r


More information on Aluminum Adjuvants can be found in our Vaccine Safety page.


\r

How is Aluminum Detected? \r

Aluminum is a naturally occurring metallic element. Most commonly found as an alloy of Al, Fe3+, and oxygen (alumina), most of this metal is dissolved within the body in small amounts. However, very large quantities may accumulate when bacteria ingest aluminum through their food supply. It is estimated that approximately 35,000 tons of aluminum are deposited into water systems annually throughout the world.\r


The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that, in addition to being absorbed into the bloodstream directly, aluminum may also enter the breast milk of mother through her breasts and be absorbed by the infant through his intestinal tract.\r

\""Aluminum is a known neurotoxin that has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, like autism and ADHD, according to one study.\""\r

\r

While there are no established long term studies linking aluminum adjuvants to serious side effects, we recommend consulting your healthcare provider before receiving any vaccine\/allergy shot, since there could be potential risks associated with vaccination.\""

gpt2-xl_79,"Yes. Multiple sclerosis is hereditary in nature. You can pass the condition to your children through maternal transmission or by inheriting it from both parents. You can also pass the disease on if you have a first-degree relative who has the illness. Your risk of passing the disorder to your offspring depends upon where in your family they live as well as what type of MS symptoms you might experience. The average risk is one percent for each generation that you carry the gene. This means that at least one person in each of your descendants will develop MS. If you have no other relatives with MS, your chances are less than 1%.\r

""You may be thinking, 'But how do I know which people could be carriers?' There's actually not a lot of evidence right now about this issue. However, there are some clues that you may be able to pick up on when searching online.

When researching for family history, you want to keep in mind that more information is always better. In addition, make sure that you're viewing information regarding disease carriers rather than general population.""

If you think you may have a higher chance of developing MS, or know someone who does, consult a healthcare professional to determine if you would benefit from being tested for the condition.

In some cases, it is possible to slow its progression or even reverse it.\nQuestion: What happens when you combine chemotherapy and radiation therapy?\nAnswer: Radiation treatment destroys tumor tissue and reduces blood flow to cancerous areas. This makes them more vulnerable to any further treatments. If both chemotherapy and radiation are given together, they increase the risk of side effects such as nausea, fatigue and diarrhea.\nQuestion: What causes weight gain after undergoing radiation or chemotherapy?\nAnswer: Weight increases because the body uses up energy during treatment. For instance, if a patient is put on 500 milligrams of the drug erlotinib every day for six months while taking radiation therapy, he would need to eat 800 grams of food each day just to maintain his weight.\nQuestion: Is it safe to go through radiation treatment again?\nAnswer: If a person was exposed only once, then he should not do so again. However, sometimes repeated exposure is necessary to prevent recurrence of the disease, but there still is a risk of harm if the treatment is done too soon after initial exposure.

Q: What is Alzheimer's Disease?\r

Complete Answer: Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, affecting approximately 4 million Americans over the age of 65 years. The hallmark features of this illness include problems with thinking, memory, language, and personality.\r

Medical Answers: What Causes Alzheimer's?\r

The exact causes of Alzheimer's disease remain unknown but scientists believe they are closely related to genetic factors, abnormal brain development, and environmental stressors such as aging.\r

Medical Answers: Do You Have Alzheimer's?\r

Although no single factor is responsible for causing Alzheimer's, some researchers believe the disorder could result from genetic changes in the brain and/or abnormal development of the neurons throughout the brain. Some studies suggest that the onset of symptoms can occur within 3 years after birth.\r

Medical Answers: How Can I Avoid Developing Alzheimer's?\r

There isn't any specific treatment for Alzheimer's, so you'll need to monitor your own cognitive decline and keep up on all medications. In addition to keeping track of your symptoms and controlling medication dosages, you should also continue taking vitamin supplements containing vitamin C. These antioxidants can protect against free radicals, which can damage cells in the brain and other areas. \r

Medical Answers: Are There Any Side Effects From Alzheimer's?\r

While Alzheimer's is not generally fatal, certain diseases and conditions may affect how well you function during the course of the disease and lead to memory loss or other complications. Most people who experience memory problems while experiencing Alzheimer's will eventually regain these abilities but others may never recover completely, so it's important to discuss the risks and benefits of treatment with your physician.\r",58,Risk to develop multiple sclerosis,-4.382728576660156,35,multimedqa,2,0.15151515151515152,352,8

The term ""massage therapy"", which was coined by Dr. William C. Smith, was used by him to describe a particular type of therapeutic procedure involving an effective application of mechanical force to certain parts of the patient's body.[7][8] In this way, he was able to differentiate massage therapy from chiropractic. In addition, his use of the word ""therapy"" indicated a special relationship between a practitioner and the individual client involved. It also indicated that the services provided were generally designed to improve the condition of the patient rather than simply relieve pain.[9] This is why today many people refer to massage therapists as ""doctors"". However, this term is not exclusive; it",130,neck and shoulder stretches,-1.2184178829193115,3,multimedqa,2,0.043478260869565216,298,6
gpt2-xl_117,"______________________________ Stage 3 Lung Cancer \nYour doctor will give you an official diagnosis of cancer at this point in time. This is often referred to as ""stage three"" or ""early stage"" because the disease has not spread throughout your body completely yet. In most cases it may go away on its own or may be managed with chemotherapy for another 6 months or so. If you have any concerns or questions about your progress, please talk to your doctor first. As long as it's within normal limits, there is no reason to panic.\n

Stage 2 Lung Cancer \nAt this point in time, your doctor may recommend further treatment, such as surgery, radiation therapy, or even chemotherapy. A tumor larger than 50% (large grade) is usually removed surgically. In some cases, however, your cancer might be too large to remove at all. When that happens, the cancer cells are called ""overgrown."" Overgrown tumors grow more quickly, and if left unchecked, they can cause the same symptoms as small tumors. Some overgrown cancers could be treated by surgery alone or may require additional treatments and monitoring. Your doctor will want to know how much growth is occurring, how fast it is growing, if you're having any side effects, and whether you need to take any medications. Ask them what type of operation would be most appropriate to remove your tumor(s).\n

Stage 1 Lung Cancer \nWhen a tumor remains at a low level in the lungs for several years, it becomes stage one lung cancer. This is when people typically think of stage one being ""minor"" cancer. However, there's a huge range of different types of this kind of cancer -- from those causing only mild symptoms like coughing and shortness of breath, to those affecting the entire respiratory system and requiring expensive surgical procedures. Stage one doesn't kill immediately, but once it does come back it requires many rounds of treatment before it's considered cured. Most people experience some side effects during the course of their treatment, but these usually subside as the body learns to work around the cancer. There also isn't always a clear line between stage one and two lung cancer -- sometimes a second round of chemotherapy may help alleviate some symptoms.\n

Cancerous Growth During Treatment The following chart shows the typical course of recovery for most patients who undergo surgery to treat lung cancer. Typically, it takes roughly 12 weeks after starting treatment to see results, although it varies based on individual conditions. \nTumors that remain",117,stage 4 metastatic lung cancer outcome,-9.117386817932127,61,multimedqa,2,0.24596774193548387,419,21

You may want to consult your doctor if there is any concern. \nQuestion: swollen testicles\nComplete Answer: The most likely cause of testicle swelling would be inflammation in the testicles. If a simple blood test can confirm that there is no issue with circulation, then it will probably take only one visit to see a physician to discuss treatment options. Please keep in mind that a simple blood test cannot diagnose actual testicular pain or swelling so please talk to your healthcare provider first. \nQuestion: what causes my nose to run when I sneeze?\nComplete Answer: This symptom occurs because of congestion of air in your nasal passages, which produces irritation and sometimes small amounts of bleeding inside your nose. The most common triggers of these little runny noses are allergies, pollen, viruses, bacteria, and smoke. In addition, they occur frequently during viral infections such as colds and flu. There are numerous ways that people try to relieve their nose running. Some people use mouthwash (such as acetone) to remove debris from the mouth but this will only make things worse. Others use mints or peppermint oil to clear away toxins. As long as all the above methods do not provide relief, there is really nothing more that you can do than try to find the root cause of the problem by visiting your family physician. If your nose does start running whenever you breathe deeply, stop doing so and seek immediate professional help.\r

In contrast, some experts advocate a more moderate carb intake such as 10% for women and 12%-15% for men. A number of other possible diets are also available with varying levels of fiber, calcium, magnesium, and/or iron content. Some of these diets require supplementation while others may be suitable without it.\nQuestion: what is ketosis?\nComplete Answer: Ketosis occurs when your body burns fat instead of glucose to produce energy, or when you use fats, proteins, and carbs together at the same time and your liver produces ketones to help metabolize fat. Ketone bodies, which also happen to be one of the main nutrients released during fasting, can provide fuel to muscle cells throughout your body for quick bursts of power. You should try to avoid using up all your stored fat since this could lead to muscle loss and eventually anemia. If you do need to burn off some excess fat then you may have to add protein to get back on track. For example, if you want to reduce your calorie intake below 1,200 calories per day but have no plans to go into starvation mode, then adding 250 grams of high quality protein each day will not only satisfy your hunger pangs, but will also aid in burning away fat stores.\nQuestion: What are the benefits of a healthy diet?\nComplete Answer: Healthy foods are ones that contain vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, and fiber and they're good sources of simple sugars. These foods are known to protect against heart disease, cancer, osteoporosis, stroke, depression, sleep disorders, diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and Alzheimer's disease (AD).\r

""How does this help me?"" ""I don't have any problem getting my medications through my pharmacy.""

This answer could be misleading if it's only meant for people with medication issues. For example, the drug companies and their lobbyists often argue against the inclusion of specific details like how much the person actually pays (or doesn't pay) for the medicine they're taking. The pharmacist should know this information because some people may not know how much their insurance covers and therefore will say something that might sound reassuring while still being inaccurate. It's important to note that the government has no way of knowing whether someone is receiving actual reimbursement for all or part of their prescription. In fact, you probably won't even get an accurate estimate of what a generic prescription costs until months after you've filled your current prescription! It would be best if your pharmacist was able to provide you with a list of the prices paid by insurers each month so you can see just how expensive your pills are. However, sometimes a pharmacist isn't aware of these pricing differences between private and public insurers. If this happens, make sure you talk to your doctor first so he/she can put together a plan of action to work around the problem. Your pharmacist also shouldn't assume you are trying to hide anything from him/her; remember there are many ways to conceal money. Some patients might buy a $100 box of drugs and then try to sell them back to the company instead of paying full price. Others might purchase a pill at one store and use cash to buy another at another store. Also keep in mind that some medicines do require prescriptions and therefore must be written up when purchased directly from the manufacturer. Even when the prescription itself comes from the pharmacist, the cost usually includes the retail markup and some other taxes related to importation. Finally, it's easy for a pharmacist to become accustomed to working with the same customers year after year. As the years go on, however, certain problems begin to emerge. There will always be those who prefer to walk into a pharmacists office and ask for a prescription over the phone.

As with any disease or condition, there are many different kinds of medications available for treating it. Some examples include insulin; other medications are used to treat high cholesterol; others help relieve pain from arthritis. The kind you choose depends on your needs and personal preferences.\r

Questions: What happens if I don't take my meds as prescribed?\nAnswer: If you follow your doctor's instructions and do not take your medication as instructed (for example, if you miss a dose), you may experience symptoms such as headache, tiredness, irritability, trouble sleeping, weight loss, lack of energy, and an increase in appetite. These symptoms could be signs of serious problems, especially if you have heart failure. You should contact your doctor immediately if you notice these symptoms because they could indicate a more severe problem or indicate that an emergency situation has occurred. \n

What if I need to go to the emergency room?\nAnswer: Contact your local hospital emergency department, and they will arrange for you to stay overnight for further evaluation. In the morning you'll get information regarding the next steps. If necessary, they may give you fluids intravenously to replace the lost glucose. To avoid complications like hypoglycemia, you must follow your doctor's directions closely so that you can get regular access to your blood glucose monitoring device. It is very important that you understand the following things when you're going to the hospital: \u00a0Blood glucose levels cannot accurately predict what type of illness you might develop while being admitted to the hospital. Therefore, even though the level of your blood glucose may appear normal, it is possible for you to become dehydrated, suffer from vomiting, shock, or die before you reach the hospital. Your doctor needs to know this so that he/she can adjust your dosage so that you feel comfortable during admission. Be sure you tell your doctor and nurse who will care for you at the hospital what medications you've been taking, how much blood glucose you have, your last meal, etc. Also, make sure that your family knows where you are staying if you're hospitalized.\r

Question: how long can I go without sleep\nAnswer: You cannot go for more than 12 hours without sleeping. Sleep deprivation increases your risk for many types of chronic diseases including cancer, heart disease, stroke and Alzheimer's Disease and decreases the quality of your life. Sleepiness and lack of concentration also increase your risk of accidents and injuries.\r

\r

Question: what do you think is the best type of sleep schedule?\r

\r

Answer: The optimal sleep schedule depends on which part of the brain controls sleep. For example, the frontal lobe (which governs decision making) plays an important role in deciding when we should wake up; however, the basal ganglia (which regulate movement and mood) play an even bigger role in controlling our circadian rhythm. Your body needs at least 7 hours of light each day and 6-8 hours of darkness. In the evening, be sure to get at least 5-6 hours of sleep and then spend as much time as possible outdoors during the night until you need to awaken again for work.\r

\r

Question: what does the word sleep mean?\r

\r

Answer: It means ""to become unconscious"" from the Latin root word sleepus meaning ""to wake."" While we normally fall asleep through breathing patterns, the brain makes use of other ways of shutting us down before we fall asleep like light stimulation and sound. Once we enter into deep sleep, the muscles relax and the brain stops producing melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep cycles. The most efficient way to fall asleep is to wear your favorite soft blanket (or pillow). A small amount of blue light stimulates the pineal gland at the base of the skull which releases serotonin and melatonin into our bloodstreams which causes our bodies to start relaxing. Once you've gotten all relaxed, go back to sleep. Try not to move around too much because then you'll disrupt the cycle of relaxation and wakefulness that is happening naturally within your mind.\r

gpt2-xl_126,"Birth Control Suppression: The female hormone estrogen is essential for the production of the eggs that contain sperm. When estrogen levels drop too low during a woman's menstrual cycle, she can no longer have children (pregnancy). In order to help prevent pregnancy, women typically take one type of birth control pill each day. If your doctor prescribes you oral contraceptives (birth control pills), the pill will likely decrease the amount of estrogen in your body by binding it to an enzyme called estrogen receptor (ER) and inhibiting its ability to bind to and activate other proteins on which more hormones need to be bound so they can do their job. Some drugs that block or interfere with this process include methotrexate (Metroxin), spironolactone (Sprycel), cyproterone acetate (Coumadin), norgestimate (Norethindrone), ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone (Vegard), and levonorgestrel (Loratadine). \r

If the level of estrogen is higher than normal (hyperandrogenism), then some of the hormone will still be able to bind to ER but not at enough of a high concentration to interact with the target protein. This means that some progesterone will remain unchanged while there may also be less androgens produced because the target protein is now inactive. This condition is known as Androgena® deficiency. Women suffering from Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), also known as juvenile androgen insensitivity syndrome (JAS) or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), also experience lower levels of estrogen even though their bodies produce more androgens. Androgen therapy helps restore these elevated levels of estrogen to those found in healthy men.


Answer: Which Pill Should I Take?

There are different types of oral contraceptive pills available depending on what stage of your monthly cycle you're in. Your physician might recommend some form of birth control pill to treat certain conditions like heavy periods, pain, PMS, acne, irregular cycles, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, polycystic ovaries, PCOS, endometrial hyperplasias, uterine fibroids, vaginal infections, recurrent miscarriage, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).

Medical professionals should always screen for the possible diagnosis of MS in these cases before prescribing any treatment plan or diagnosing a new relapse.

Why do people ask me questions about my mental health status?

People often want information on their mental health status because they think that some disease makes them less capable of coping with everyday life. This belief is unfounded; there is no evidence whatsoever that mental illness causes people's ability to cope with daily activities to decrease. People often seek help from psychiatrists and psychologists when they experience difficulties in their lives, especially during difficult times in their lives (e.g., divorce, unemployment). When asked how someone might feel if he were living through the same time period in their life, most people would say ""I'd probably just start crying."" However, this isn't true either! The person likely wouldn't just cry – rather they would express themselves emotionally, try to understand the situation, and talk to friends and family members about what's going on. In short, asking people why they need help doesn't make sense. They don't know you're trying to help them. You'll only get hurt feelings and maybe even give up. What's worse, people will probably assume your caretaker attitude toward them means you're judging them.",83,Why get episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis?,-0.0148981120437383,0,multimedqa,3,0.0,269,11

Docetaxel is used as part of the standard care protocol for patients with stage IV breast cancers diagnosed after surgery. Doxil is an immunosuppressant drug that blocks the production of tumor proteins needed by normal cells to function properly. Temozolomide is a type of anti-estrogen agent. It induces bone marrow to produce more white blood cells. The drugs prevent the patient's immune system from recognizing tumors and destroying them. Because of these features, the combination results in effective survival compared to chemotherapy alone. When combined with radiation therapy, which destroys tissue, this combination results in even greater effectiveness than when given individually. This is why most physicians believe that doctors should use this treatment whenever available.\nQuestion: Is oral contraceptive use associated with breast cancer?\nAnswer: Oral contraceptives have become very popular recently. Many people believe they may reduce their risk of developing breast cancer by using a birth control pill containing estrogen. But recent studies show that there is no consistent evidence that birth control pills increase a woman's risk of breast cancer.\nQuestion: Is a man at increased risk of having breast cancer if he has had both ovarian cysts AND a lobular carcinoma of the ovary?\nComplete Answer: There is some evidence that men who have had two ovarian cysts and one lobular carcinoma of the ovary have a higher risk of developing breast cancer than those whose disease did not involve either of these organs. However, other factors such as age, family history, obesity, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity level, and hormone replacement therapy all play a role.\nQuestion: How long does it take for a person to develop breast cancer?\nAnswer: Breast cancer develops over time. It starts in the breasts but progresses to other parts of the body including the liver, bones, and skin. Most women start experiencing symptoms at age 40-50 years old. Symptoms include painful breasts, tenderness, lumpiness, weight loss, abnormal bleeding, and other changes.

gpt2-xl_81,"Yes. You can do either at the same time. This is because MS is different from other diseases in that it has no cure. The disease causes nerve damage which may cause problems walking or talking and sometimes affects breathing. It also makes it difficult for some people to see well enough to read. Some doctors believe you should not work while your symptoms persist. Others say you will benefit from having some of your daily activities performed by someone who is not affected by MS.\f

Additional Questions: What is MS? \f\bIs there an treatment? \f\bWhat types of drugs are used in treating MS?\f\bWhat medications should be avoided while on these medications? Complete Answer: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is caused by inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. During this inflammatory process, damaged cells break down into substances called proteins that affect how the body functions.\u00a0The damage to the nerves occurs over many years. As a result, MS patients have difficulties controlling their muscles or moving around. In addition, they can become blind if one part of their visual system loses sight temporarily. Because MS usually starts before age 30, most MS patients suffer from it until their 40s. There is currently no known cure for MS, but treatments help reduce symptoms and allow patients to live more independent lives. A person with MS does not actually have lesions in his or her brain. They're simply manifestations of the disease. An immune system attack destroys the brain's outer covering called myelin. Myelinating tissue helps carry signals between nerve cells in the central nervous system. Damage to myelin weakens the connections between these cells and can lead to neurological disability. One way to treat MS is to inhibit the activity of various enzymes involved in the production of certain proteins. These inhibiting drugs help prevent cell destruction and stop attacks on nerve cells. These drugs, such as Tysabri (natalizumab), are often given together with another medication called glatiramer acetate. Glatiramer acetate decreases the ability of activated T cells to attack myelin. People taking Tysabri must take a daily pill containing both medicines. Other MS treatment options include oral steroids (such as prednisone), immunosuppressant therapy (such as cyclophosphamide), and even surgery (such as meningitis). Some of the medications used to treat MS include methotrexate, piroxicam, adalimumab, daclizumab, and inflix",81,Can I work and study full-time with multiple sclerosis?,-0.6276418566703796,4,multimedqa,3,0.0182648401826484,386,14

You must be aware that you are dealing with two separate conditions that share some commonalities. They both impact on your bone density, cause joint pain and stiffness, and may affect your menstrual cycles. Although women experience a decrease in estrogen during their first few years after menopause, MS affects men as well. It's recommended for you to get your MS information from this site only.

What is Menopause? What are Menopause Symptoms and Symptoms of MS?


Menopause is defined as the time between the age of 40 and 50 when your ovaries stop making mature eggs (ovulation). Most of us will notice changes in our moods, sex drive, energy levels, or body odor while we're experiencing Menopause. For most, Menopause will last 6 months - 1 year. However, Menopause symptoms vary greatly based upon your personal genetics, age, and overall health history.


Although Menopause is not the same thing as Menopause symptoms, it should still raise an eyebrow at you if you've ever had any of these symptoms:

Frequent period problems. During Menopause, you may find yourself having irregular periods or no periods at all. There may also be bleeding between your periods or heavier bleeding than normal, especially around your periods. Your doctor can check for signs of menorrhagia (menstrual pain) before diagnosing Menopause. This includes back pain and vaginal discomfort. Menstrual cramps and bloating, which occur when your uterus shrinks and contracts and pushes blood out through your vagina, can also be confused with Menopause. These can happen anytime throughout your menstrual cycle.

gpt2-xl_105,"Wisdom teeth have two or three different sets of roots. Most people have their wisdom teeth on the front (or lower) side of the mouth. The main reason that wisdom teeth cause pain is because they can damage the nerves in your gums when you bite down hard enough to cut them. This makes it harder for the dentist's drill to get through. So if you've got wisdom teeth, try to keep your jaw as relaxed as possible during your appointment by using a mirror instead of a pencil. You will be able to see how much pressure you put into your teeth when you eat. For example, if you chew with your lower jaw, your teeth may look bigger than usual while chewing food. Try to avoid eating a lot of foods that require lots of force to swallow. If you still want to eat, make sure to swallow slowly so that your stomach isn't emptying too quickly. The more time you take between swallowing, the better. Also, don't wait until the last minute before asking questions. A doctor should be able to answer all of your questions immediately.\nQuestion: Can I use my braces after I've had my wisdom teeth removed? Complete Answer: Yes! Your doctors might suggest that you wear your braces after your wisdom teeth are gone. They might also give you some instructions on how to remove the braces. Sometimes, they'll prescribe a special oral care product called an antiseptic mouthwash that you can use after your wisdom teeth have been removed.\nQuestion: Will I lose my braces? Complete Answer: Depending on your age and what kind of wisdom teeth were taken out, you could very well lose your braces. However, not many people actually do that. In most cases, the surgery won't affect your ability to walk normally again, but you might notice something that's unusual. Some people find they seem to have shorter jaws, which might lead to problems like bad breath, or they might not be able to eat properly due to a lack of muscle control. If you think this is happening to you, you can tell your doctor right away. Then, he or she can help you figure out why your mouth looks odd.\nQuestions: Is there anything else I need to know? Complete Answers: It's important to remember that when your dentist removes your wisdom teeth, you may feel numb, tingly, or even nauseous at first.

There is some evidence that a ketogenic/keto diet can be used in combination with other therapeutic approaches such as medication or insulin therapy (for Type 1 and 2) to help reduce blood glucose levels while improving glycemic control or providing long-term treatment benefit.[1]

A ketogenic diet has been shown effective in reducing the amount of carbohydrates you eat,[2] and may have advantages over medications if you're on one. For example, it's often easier to stick to your diet when you don't feel hungry and crave carbs, which means you can stay at a lower carb level and avoid side effects from high levels of insulin. But ketogenic diets also have drawbacks: You must adhere closely to this diet because it requires more frequent monitoring than any other kind of diet.[3] The lack of physical activity and the resulting loss of muscle mass makes it very difficult for someone who is overweight or obese to maintain their weight without losing significant amounts of fat first.[4][5][6][7] The most common adverse reactions to low carbohydrate diets include headache, fatigue, irritability, depression and sometimes nausea.[8] Your doctor should be able to recommend an optimal keto diet based upon your particular needs.

If you have been diagnosed with an chronic condition such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, or hypertension, ask the questions in this section to learn more. \nquestion: how does exercise help\nAnswer: Physical fitness is important because it improves coordination, balance, strength, endurance, flexibility, mental performance, and aerobic capacity (i.e., oxygen uptake). Exercise is beneficial for everyone regardless of age, gender, race, ability level, or fitness level. However, exercising regularly may benefit older adults if they have some limitations or problems that limit their daily function or require special care or assistance.\r

\nquestion: what are the effects of physical exercise on my joints?\r

Complete Answer: Joints work together as one unit to move our bodies. When we perform a movement without proper form, joints become fatigued and/or injured. Most injuries occur when we overuse joints, especially the knees, shoulders, hips, ankles, wrists, elbows, and shoulders. These problems result in pain, loss of range of motion, weakness, discomfort, increased inflammation, and decreased mobility. The following exercise recommendations will allow you to find ways to maintain healthy joint function and prevent injury. \m

\nquestion: how do I increase muscle mass?\r

Answer: Muscles grow by gaining new blood supply and nutrients. This process occurs throughout the entire body as your cells divide. A workout increases muscle tone, which also helps strengthen muscles. Some types of exercises, like weight lifting, pushups, sit-ups, and lunges, can build stronger muscles. Other exercises, such as yoga or Pilates, use resistance to develop strength. You can choose from various workouts that target specific muscle groups. For example, an upper-body exercise called ""back extensions"" targets your lumbar area and leg extensors while a lower-body exercise, ""leg curls,"" targets your abdominal, gluteal, and quadriceps areas. \m

\nquestion: how can I burn fat faster?\r

Answer: One way to gain lean body mass is through eating less calories than you expend during an active lifestyle. To achieve this goal, eat foods rich in protein, complex carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins C and E, potassium, and magnesium. Also add water and salt during meals to ensure that your body gets all the essential",97,benefits of physical activity,-0.1201789751648902,25,multimedqa,3,0.11210762331838565,370,8

Properly trained bodies have strong bones, which provide stability in a healthy way. However, if your bones are weak or overworked, then the result may be injury. Therefore, make sure you get enough sleep, eat well, and avoid injuries by taking regular physical activity into consideration when developing good posture. You can do so with some simple steps. For example: \u201cGet plenty of rest. Sleep 6 hours a day. Make time to go outside for exercise. Do cardio or weight training. Get at least 30 minutes of moderate activity 5 days per week.\u201dIf this doesn't seem like much, think of the benefits on your mood, energy levels, and general health! The best thing about getting enough sleep is that, because your body is no longer working to produce extra energy from food, you won't be feeling hungry during the day, and you'll feel more satisfied with what you're eating. In addition to improving energy levels, exercise helps prevent many diseases by promoting healthier metabolism. It also reduces inflammation, improves immune function, and boosts overall strength and stamina. A variety of different types of exercise including resistance training, martial arts, swimming, cycling, and dancing can help to keep you active. One of the easiest ways to improve your health while you're sitting down is to start walking or riding a bike.

Answer: First, talk with your child's teacher or principal about what was happening at school. Did the student seem anxious? Was she tired or distracted during class? It may be important to find out if other students were around the child when the problem occurred. Ask questions like this in order to prevent future incidents. Also consider contacting the school nurse or psychologist if you think something is wrong.\r


If your child complains of fatigue, weakness or muscle aches, you may want to contact the school counselor or medical staff immediately for advice. You also might want to call the school office hours to see if anyone else is available to help you.

Ask your doctor if he/she recommends any special tests or examinations to check for diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, liver problems, vitamin B12 deficiency, kidney problems, high blood pressure, etc. If these issues have already been ruled out, then you probably won't need to worry much about these kinds of problems unless your child starts showing symptoms right away.

It also helps prevent blindness caused by other diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration. However, beta carotene is more beneficial than vitamin A for preventing eye damage from cancer, age-related macular degeneration, and infections. Beta carotene supplements should be taken after meals because it's best absorbed when eaten in this manner. Most people need 400 IU per day of alpha-carotene. Alpha-carotene can also be found in some dark leafy vegetables. These include carrots, corn, peas, tomatoes, and potatoes. The American Heart Association recommends that women eat 4 servings of fruits and vegetables each week, including 1-2 cups of greens. Men should consume 3 servings of vegetables per week. For an entire year, the Food and Drug Administration says there is no reason not to take a daily supplement of 300 mcg of both alpha- and beta carotene, although most doctors agree on one dose of vitamin A per day. Both men and women need these vitamins to reduce their risk of getting certain cancers and cardiovascular disease. Some research suggests that consuming large amounts of beta carotene, especially in combination with a high intake of vitamin A, may increase the chance of developing colon cancer. In addition, they appear to inhibit the growth of prostate and breast cancers. Women who get very little beta carotene might want to consider eating lots of spinach. One serving of raw kale provides over 30 percent of the recommended daily amount of vitamin A.\n\f\ \nFor more information, visit www.mslchew.com

If you have been diagnosed with MS but don't know what caused it, you may consider going through your doctor's office for a physical exam. They will likely ask you questions about your current symptoms and how long you've had them. In addition, they'll take your blood pressure and heart rate while they examine your neck, spine, hips, knees, ankles, feet, hands, and fingers. They will look at you under a microscope to see if you're suffering from arthritis or other problems. These tests may help your doctor determine whether you have some kind of underlying problem. Your physician may also prescribe certain medications or supplements that he or she believes may prevent or cure MS. It is important not to stop taking these medications without first talking to your doctor or pharmacist.\rQuestion: What kinds of food should I eat? Complete Answer: You need to choose foods that contain healthy fats and protein. Avoid refined carbs like white bread, pastries, sugary cereals, cookies, cakes, and potato chips. Also avoid sugar-sweetened beverages. Drink water instead of soda or juice. Limit red meat such as beef, pork, lamb, mutton, duck, etc., and poultry, fish, shellfish, and eggs because these animals tend to consume high levels of cholesterol. Do not overindulge in saturated fat, which increases your risk for heart disease. High intakes of omega-6 fatty acids (found mainly in vegetable oils) can raise your LDL (bad) cholesterol levels, increase triglyceride levels, and decrease good HDL (good) cholesterol. Avoid processed foods, especially those containing trans fat. Instead, opt for fresh vegetables, whole grain products, nuts, seeds, beans, and low-fat dairy products. Ask your dietitian or health professional for specific recommendations on what types of foods are right for you.\rQuestion: What are some common conditions I'm most likely to get?\rAnswer:\r\nOsteoporosis\r\tDementia\r\tDiabetes mellitus\r\tAlzheimer disease\",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-5.711158275604248,31,multimedqa,3,0.15196078431372548,369,0
gpt2-xl_54,"Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the central nervous system (CNS). It primarily causes progressive paralysis of your muscles by attacking their protective covering called myelin. The disease also damages many other tissues in the body, such as the heart, lungs, bones and joints, resulting in debilitating symptoms and poor quality of life. The symptoms can vary greatly from person to person depending on the number and location of these areas affected. In general, the symptoms are divided into two main categories: primary and secondary (primary) symptoms.\r

Primary Symptoms \r Primary symptoms may be any of several different types of problems. They occur most frequently at rest or while you're doing something passive like sitting still. These symptoms usually start within 24 hours after exposure to a trigger such as a cold or viral infection. Many people develop some of these symptoms years before they first experience any kind of disability caused by the disease.\r

Secondary Symptoms \r Secondary symptoms typically appear around 30 days after the initial onset of the disease and last for anywhere between 6 months and 3 years. However, these symptoms do not necessarily progress according to time; rather, they can come on suddenly at one point and then go away completely as the body adjusts. Secondary symptoms include muscle weakness, loss of appetite and fatigue, which affect almost everyone with MS. Some secondary symptoms can improve over time, sometimes significantly, but others don't respond well to treatment. If the effects of one symptom persist after 10 years, it's considered a chronic stage.\r

Healthcare providers use standard diagnostic criteria in determining if you have multiple sclerosis. Each type of test has its own strengths and weaknesses, so finding the right one depends on both the patient's age and condition. A history, physical exam and lab work are all important components of making the diagnosis.\r

Diagnostic Tests\r

Your doctor will perform many tests when diagnosing MS. This includes:\r

Blood tests \r These checks assess how much white blood cells (WBCs) and red blood cells (RBCs) there are in your blood. Your doctor may also order more specific tests such as CT scans (CT scans measure bone marrow density); MRI scans (which look at the inner workings of the brain and spinal cord); and PET scans (which measure the amount of certain substances in your blood), among others. WBCs and RBCs detect a wide range of diseases.\r

According to the American Psychological Association, 1 in 6 adults experience some type of mental illness (i.e., depression, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder). There is no single cause of these disorders; each person's symptoms may be caused by factors such as genetic vulnerability, childhood experiences, current life stresses, emotional turmoil, stressful events, and even changes in environment. You have probably experienced at least one major depressive episode in your lifetime, and some people feel depressed every day. However, not everyone with major depressive disorder (MDD) will need professional help to stop its progression. Some individuals will simply require medication and/or psychotherapy to control their depressive symptoms, while others who do not respond well to treatment may benefit from talk therapy (psychotherapy).

Question: My doctor prescribed me Xanax because I had bad panic attacks after working in a factory. Why would you prescribe me Xanax if it won't relieve my panic attacks? Complete Answer: Panic Attacks \r

Pills for Panic Attacks \r

The FDA has classified Xanax as a Class A drug (an addictive substance), meaning that this particular class of drugs causes serious risks including addiction. To reduce your chances of becoming addicted to Xanax, try taking Xanax on the same day that you take other medications that have similar effects. This way, if you start feeling better, you won't get discouraged when you notice that your symptoms return. Many people also find that following up with a checkup at least once a month can help make sure that your Xanax prescription isn't affecting your sleep cycle, which could cause insomnia later. Also keep in mind that certain side effects of Xanax include dry mouth, constipation, headache, nausea, sweating, stomach aches, dizziness, loss of appetite, drowsiness, and sleepiness. In addition, many people report using Xanax excessively over a long period of time, which is why some doctors recommend that you only use the pills under close supervision. Although Xanax has been shown to be effective for treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), there still remain questions regarding the safety of Xanax.

Although it takes months or years for symptoms to develop, patients with RRMS often experience their first relapse within four to six weeks of initial symptom onset, or as soon as one month after the appearance of the first physical signs.

A few of the side effects of certain prescription medicines may be serious. It's important to tell your doctor if you have experienced any problems while using your medicine. Medication side effect reports submitted to Health Canada by physicians are posted on www.healthcanada.gc.ca/drugsatfda\u2014and include summaries of all adverse events reported to the drug safety monitoring program (DSMP). These reports do not indicate whether the problem caused the symptoms reported or simply that the symptom was present at the time of reporting.

In rare cases, severe allergic reactions can occur in some patients after starting a new type of medication, or following a dose increase, while others may experience side effects such as dizziness or shortness of breath. However, most allergic reactions are mild and go away on their own within a week or two, so check with your doctor before changing your treatment regimen. Ask your doctor before altering your dosage of any of your medicines because doing so may make it more difficult to get better. Your doctor will probably need to run tests to find out why you started feeling ill or having trouble tolerating your current dose.\r

Q: Is MS just one form of fibromyalgia?

A: No. Fibromyalgia affects more than just the muscles and joints. Muscles and bones become inflamed or stiff, leading to painful symptoms such as stiffness, muscle cramps, loss of mobility, stiffness in joints, swollen joints, leg pains, joint swelling, pain when moving, and headaches. For example, you might have leg pain when sitting down, especially if you sit on a hard surface like concrete, a wood floor, or carpet. You might also have leg cramping or soreness when bending over, walking up stairs, lifting weights, or getting into cars. If you're in good health, you might not notice these symptoms at all.

Glycation occurs at all times when glucose levels increase, so it is particularly dangerous during periods of high carbohydrate intake.\

How do we know if sugar has damaged our cells? This damage is caused by the chemical structure of sucrose, which consists of two disaccharides (fructose and glucose) linked together as one molecule by an ester bond (Figure 1).\

Figure 1


Sucrose is made up of fructose and glucose. The sugars' molecular structure (symmetry) allows them to be linked by the same bonds found between water molecules. \

Why does this matter? When carbohydrates enter cells, the sugars are converted to free fatty acids and other components of triglyceride and cholesterol (Figure 2), which will then bind with cell membrane lipids to form lipoproteins such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). PAI-1 binds to platelets and prevents their clotting ability from working properly.\

This can also improve quality of life for people who have had multiple sclerosis (MS) before.\r \rQuestions: What types of diseases do I need to check if I have MS?\rFull Answer: If you think you might have MS, then it's important that you see an experienced doctor or neurologist as soon as possible. There are three main types of MS: relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRM), secondary progressive MS (SPMS), and primary progressive MS (PPMD). Each one has different treatments and causes.\r \rQuestions: I want to know what stage I am in. What are the signs and symptoms of each phase?\rAnswer: Relapse of MS occurs when the body no longer responds properly to MS medicine. Relapses are usually sudden (within a few weeks or months after starting treatment). Signs and symptoms change over time. Some relapses occur within the first several years after starting treatment and others occur later in life, after many years of disability.\r You should discuss any changes in your symptoms with your doctor or nurse.\rIn some cases, early relapse of MS can be prevented by using certain medications. Most often, these medications require daily doses that must be taken at least once a day.\rSome individuals recover from their relapses without treatment. However, many cannot tolerate such long courses of medication and experience severe side effects, including fatigue, depression, anxiety, irritability, and suicidal thoughts.\rResponsible For Your Health and Well Being

The main symptoms of primary progressive MS include numbness or paralysis on one side of the body; difficulty walking, speaking, swallowing, and thinking; and problems with balance. Secondary progressive MS can also cause weakness, fatigue, and vision loss.\rQuestion: What are the signs and symptoms of Parkinson\'s disease?\rAnswer: The signs and symptoms of Parkinson\'s disease vary widely from person to person and may be mild (e.g., slowness of movement) to severe (e.g., tremors). Some people do not experience any symptoms at all. A person who has been diagnosed with Parkinson\'s disease usually experiences worsening symptoms over time that may worsen until they become disabling. In addition, Parkinson\'s disease affects different parts of the brain differently. Certain parts of the brain are affected by the condition while other parts remain unaffected. The result is a range of symptoms. The main symptom(s) of Parkinson\'s disease are tremor (also called rigidity), stiffness of muscles (usually the legs and shoulders), involuntary movements of the face, and slurred speech. Other symptoms may include depression, memory problems, trouble with speech, and inability to control motor activities. If you suspect that you have Parkinson\'s disease, please visit your family doctor for evaluation. \rQuestion: How does the diagnosis of diabetes affect my care team?\rAnswer: Diabetic patients often experience long waits at the emergency department or urgent care facility for treatment. These delays put our patients at risk for developing life threatening complications such as kidney failure, heart attack, stroke, or even death.

gpt2-xl_93,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that damages the immune system in the central nervous system, causing damage throughout the body (brain, spinal cord, eyes, kidneys, etc.). Symptoms of MS include muscle weakness and stiffness, numbness or tingling sensations, problems with balance, difficulty walking, and fatigue. These symptoms can be caused by many factors including genetics and environmental exposure, but they typically occur within weeks of being diagnosed. The most common MS treatments involve steroids or immunosuppressive drugs like cyclophosphamide. Many patients also take medication for depression or anxiety as well as oral medications used to treat asthma or allergies. People who have MS may notice other problems related to their physical and mental abilities such as memory loss, trouble concentrating, lack of insight into personal thoughts and feelings, vision changes, trouble swallowing or breathing, and inability to perform daily tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. Because there is no cure for MS, treatment usually involves reducing symptoms over time while improving overall quality of life.\nAdditional Information on Multiple Sclerosis

Questions About Sleep Quality: How Often Are My Dreams Relived?\nAnswer: If you're concerned about your sleep quality, check out our \u003c\/a\u003e Sleep Questions article. There you will find information about how long it takes to fall asleep at night, what happens during REM (rapid eye movement), when dreams occur, and more! It's not easy to determine whether your dream recall falls below average because you aren't always aware of what you are dreaming until you wake up from your nap. However, one thing you should do is keep a diary of all dreams you remember. This helps you to pinpoint specific times when certain things happen so you can figure out if your dreams seem to repeat themselves too often. By keeping a journal, you'll get a better idea of whether you're falling asleep quickly at night or taking longer than usual to fall asleep each night. You should make sure to avoid caffeine before bedtime because this increases your heart rate which triggers your body to start relaxing. Also, try to go to sleep earlier, since waking up early is just a waste of energy and could result in you feeling groggy when you finally wake up in the morning. Remember though that getting enough rest each day can help improve your performance and performance levels in everyday activities such as work and school. So make sure to maintain good sleep habits and you'll likely see improvements in your ability to stay focused and productive!\r",93,Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?,-0.0345212891697883,2,multimedqa,3,0.010101010101010102,421,37

gpt2-xl_79,"This is an often asked question by people who have MS or any of its symptoms, but do not currently have the disease themselves. No specific treatment has been proven effective for passing it on to another person. However, in theory, if there is enough overlap between your immune system and that of someone with MS, you may be able to reduce the severity of their symptoms. The first step would be to enroll yourself as an MS patient into an MS support group. Most MS groups will need written permission from you before they can contact you. If they find out about you through an MS support group and want to discuss this option, please provide them with your email address so they know where to send the permission request. You might also consider taking part in a clinical trial to see whether you might benefit from getting some medication in order to treat your MS symptoms. \r

Q: Do I really have to take antihistamines during my pregnancy if I already took them when pregnant?\r

Answer: It's very important that you understand what happens after your period ends, when your body needs something extra to help fight off infection or protect against allergic reactions. There are many women who end up needing these medications even though they had taken them at no time prior to conception. These medicines tend to cause birth defects, such as spina bifida (a birth defect that makes a baby's spine crooked), in children whose mothers were taking them while they were pregnant. Therefore, if you're considering using these kinds of drugs, make sure you understand how long those chemicals stay in your bloodstream and whether taking them on top of your regular routine will put you at risk for problems later.


If you still don't feel ready to give birth without antihistamine medicine, talk to your doctor about having your blood work checked for possible drug exposure.\r

Q: Can I smoke while breastfeeding?\r

Answer: Some research shows that smoking while breastfeeding could pose risks for both mom and child. There isn't enough evidence yet to determine whether smoking actually causes harmful effects like lung cancer or heart disease. As a general rule, however, it seems wise to avoid smoking while breastfeeding, regardless of your age. Smoking during pregnancy can increase the chance that your newborn will develop asthma, which can result in severe breathing difficulties for the infant. And if you smoke while nursing, you are putting your baby at greater risk than normal of developing allergies, especially to food and certain medicines.

Answer: Question: What are the most important risk factors for developing breast cancer?\nComplete Answer: A person's age at menarche (first menstrual period) and her age at first birth are both associated with an increased risk for early-onset breast cancer. In addition, women who smoke while they are pregnant may increase their child's risk for breast cancer later in life by increasing estrogen levels in their milk.\r

Answer: Question: What should you do if your doctor recommends regular mammograms or a physical exam instead?\nComplete Answer: If your doctor suggests these exams, they should not replace regular screenings. An annual mammogram can identify tumors in areas where there may not otherwise be any signs of disease. Physical exams, however, are more invasive and therefore offer no additional benefit over mammography.\r

Answer: Question: How does this website work?\nComplete Answer: This website provides information on how to use various forms of screening test. These screens include breast self-exams and Pap smears; also called diagnostic imaging examinations (DI), these are often recommended because they detect small abnormal masses (in contrast with mammograms, which look for tumors). You can learn about these services at the links below\r

Question: What happens if I get a diagnosis of breast cancer from a breast self-exam?\nComplete Answer: Most people who receive a diagnosis through a self-examination do well following treatment without need for further treatment. However, if you are under 18 years old, talk to your doctor about whether it would make sense for you to undergo surgery to remove the mass. Some types of breast cancers can spread to distant parts of the body, so some treatments are available specifically for that reason. For example, chemotherapy is sometimes given to adults who have received radiation therapy for a noncancerous tumor but whose original tumors were still growing. \r

gpt2-xl_58,"There is no risk of developing MS in the general population if you do not have any history of it or if your MS does not occur during childhood.\nQuestion: Why don't most people with MS get better?\nAnswer: The cause of MS is unclear but may be caused by abnormal immune responses to proteins called cytokines. Certain kinds of vaccines (for example, the MMR) can trigger an allergic reaction which produces a small amount of IgE antibodies that cross react with the protein known as beta-amyloid in a person's brain and spinal cord. This leads to inflammation and damage to the nerve cells that control muscles. In some cases, this damage is irreversible and leads to paralysis and death in many affected patients.

The following vaccine types were used during 2015-16 for preventative purposes only:

DTP/DTaP/Hib (all ages): No evidence exists showing that these vaccines may contribute to autism spectrum disorder.

gpt2-xl_113,"\nThere is no link between asthma and COV. However, asthma is an environmental disease which may be caused by the inhalation of smoke particles from combustible sources such as wood or paper, while COV occurs when air flows over surfaces that have been coated with chemicals for protection against fire damage. The two conditions do not usually occur in isolation because the presence of one causes other effects, such as dryness of the nose, coughing or wheezing in some cases, cough attacks, shortness of breath and fatigue, all symptoms which can lead to hospitalization. In addition, there may be other respiratory diseases linked to inhaling chemicals, such as tuberculosis, bronchitis, emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is no scientific evidence linking smoking to these problems.\rQuestion: Why does my child get colds?\rAnswer: Your child has something called the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which makes him susceptible to infection with viruses and bacteria. If your child's body produces more than enough antibodies to fight off infections, he will probably never become infected.\rQuestion: What is the difference between allergies and asthma?\rAnswer: Allergies are general reactions to allergens found on certain foods and objects. These reactions include sneezing, itchy eyes, runny noses, watery eyes, hives and throat swelling. Most allergic conditions resolve without treatment. Asthma, however, results when your immune system reacts to a substance released into your lungs by a chemical reaction inside your lung tissue cells. If this happens frequently, you may develop a severe form of asthma called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or chronic lung disease (CLD). This condition often leads to permanent breathing difficulties, particularly if you live long enough. It is important to understand how asthma develops so that you know what tests to order.\rQuestion: Can I use medication to treat myself?\r\tAnswer: Yes, but only if you follow the instructions carefully. You should take medication as prescribed by your physician and consult with them before you start taking it. The dose depends upon many factors including age, gender, weight, previous use, history of illness or injury, whether you have any known allergies, and family history.

1) Your upper back is the biggest muscle group in your body. Its job is to support and stabilize your spine while bending over. It also allows you to draw in air through your lungs so that it can be breathed into your lungs. The muscles of your upper back include your pectoralis major (upper chest), latissimus dorsi (lower chest), rotator cuff, subscapularis (shoulder blade), trapezius, rhomboids, trapezius infront, serratus anterior (front of shoulder), teres minor (bicep), serratus posterior (back of shoulder), deltoid, scapulae, triceps brachii (chest biceps), triceps longus/ shortus, triceps insert (longer biceps), triceps surae (short biceps), bicep flexors. You should not use any type of exercise like pullups, dips or pushdowns that require excessive force production because they will place undue stress on your upper back. Instead, try these exercises instead, which will work your shoulders more effectively.

2) A rounded back allows for greater range of motion and flexibility in all areas of your arms and legs. This will enable you to better control your movements. An exaggerated curve at the end of each arm allows you to make sure there's no point where your hand goes below your chin and prevent injury. When standing with one leg raised and bent over, place your hands about two inches apart from each other. Bend both knees slightly and raise them until your thighs are parallel with the floor. Now let go of both ankles simultaneously and turn 180 degrees by lowering yourself down onto your heels. Repeat this process with both feet until your calves are parallel with the ground. Next, bend your right knee behind you, rotate your left elbow forward until it points just above your ear, and reach backward with your right forearm while holding your head up high.

The body is able to detect and remove toxins produced from the toxins in the stomach through its lymphatic system. In this particular case, the symptoms can be caused by toxins that have been released into the blood stream (leaky gut syndrome). The lymphatic system is composed of white blood cells, which are capable of filtering out any toxins that may enter the bloodstream. However, it isn't always effective at doing so. For instance, when you eat a large amount of food, your stomach acid will help break down these toxins, but if there's not enough stomach acid present to support this process, then toxins will still be released into the bloodstream, and may travel along with other substances in your digestive tract until they reach a spot where they can attach themselves to your red blood cells. These toxins are known as leukotoxins, or chemicals that create a build up of ammonia (which lowers your immunity) within your blood stream. When this happens, it causes your immune system to react negatively towards these harmful proteins, and cause severe damage to your entire body.Leaky Gut Syndrome (LGS): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_gut_syndrome Leaky gut syndrome is an autoimmune disorder in which the body attacks itself, resulting in leaky gut, gastrointestinal disturbances, constipation, diarrhea, weight loss, fever, fatigue and depression. \nQuestion: Why do some people suffer from chronic pain while others don't? Complete Answer:\r

\r

Pain in your lower back, neck, shoulders and arms is often called sciatica, which simply means ""pain on one side."" It's actually more accurately described as pain involving both sides of your spine; typically, these areas become inflamed and painful when you walk, exercise or perform manual tasks like lifting something heavy. This is because your spinal nerves have been compressed and weakened by years of repetitive stress. Although many people suffering from sciatica believe their condition stems from overuse of movement, this theory has yet to be proven. Many patients also report feeling numbness or tingling throughout parts of their bodies when in intense pain. This is due to nerve compression. The most common cause of nerve compression is inflammation, which occurs when bacteria invade your soft tissues and begin to proliferate. Inflammation creates scar tissue around the damaged area, which blocks the flow of oxygenated blood through the affected tissues.

In the case of trauma, the nervous system's natural repair mechanisms begin to function again. The process of regeneration takes several months, depending on the nature of the injuries, and results in new nerve cell growth and restoration of brain cells to their healthy resting state. A traumatic brain injury typically leads to permanent disability in which the affected parts of the brain continue to function poorly, resulting in some degree of functional impairment. A person may have problems with learning and remembering information; speech, reading, and writing skills may be impaired; social interactions and physical activity may be difficult; and daily activities such as eating, sleeping, and walking become more difficult due to decreased attention span, increased anxiety, reduced motor skills, and loss of balance.\nDoes the mind control the body?\nAnswer: Not entirely. However, many people believe there must be something going on between the mind and body if we feel so relaxed when we're asleep.

""The goal of this study was to understand how people interpret various types of information that they receive from medical sources and how they make decisions when interpreting these information,"" said study co-author Dr. David M. Buss, associate professor of medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. ""We found that most consumers use multiple different methods when making choices about whether or not an intervention they want to implement will help them achieve their goals.""

Buss' team studied 2,000 adults who filled out a survey on the web site Quora asking questions such as ""How important is it for someone to have access to a well-educated healthcare provider?"" and ""How much does healthcare cost in our country?"" They also asked participants about their own experiences with health care providers, including their doctors and nurses, along with questions like, ""What is your impression of your doctor?""

Responses to the first question were measured using several variables designed by researchers to capture a variety of factors, including demographic characteristics (gender, age group, income) and medical history. Questions on healthcare costs were analyzed by measuring the likelihood that respondents would say, ""I am currently paying more than I should because my insurance company hasn't been keeping up with its payments for medications and treatments,"" based on responses to another question regarding financial responsibility.

In addition to answering questions about personal experience with healthcare providers, study participants answered other questions related to the overall quality of health care provided by healthcare providers; how likely respondents were to recommend their doctor or hospital to others; and a final question about how much they thought each of their top five health care providers were charging per visit. These measures allowed the researchers to identify which factors contributed to the decisions individuals made about whether or not to pay attention to their healthcare providers.

Surprisingly, while health care costs were one of the strongest predictors of whether consumers cited their health care provider's performance as a reason they did not choose to follow through with recommendations or treatment recommendations made during visits, none of the factors predicted whether individuals paid extra attention to recommendations about medication adherence",45,Can diabetes be cured?,-12.065547943115234,110,multimedqa,3,0.873015873015873,428,1

This condition, known as cervical spondylosis, can be treated with special sleeping pill or using some other solution. \nQuestion: what causes headache?\nAnswer: Headaches result from changes in blood vessels that supply your brain. Certain medications may help treat headaches, such as caffeine and aspirin. If you experience more than one headache per day, consult your doctor.\nQuestion: why do I have stomach ache when I eat?\nAnswer: You have stomach ache because your stomach contents pass through your digestive system undigested. Some people develop this symptom after eating foods containing enzyme inhibitors (protease inhibitors). Foods rich in these enzymes include tomatoes, lettuce, peppers, eggs, shellfish, nuts, seafood, beans, legumes, peas, peanuts, soybeans, wheat, corn, whole grains, potatoes, yeast products, fruit juices, tea, coffee, sugar, and alcoholic beverages. Other conditions commonly cause stomach ache are high cholesterol levels, diabetes, kidney disease, gallstones, and tumors. It's important not to ignore symptoms of an infection because they could also indicate a cancerous growth.\nQuestion: what does stomach ulcer mean?\nAnswer: Your body produces chemicals called acids when it attempts to protect itself from bacteria. Acid production increases during periods of stress, especially if you are stressed out.

""How does cold weather affect my heart?\r

Answer: Cold temperatures make you feel tired and less energetic. Your blood flow becomes lower than normal, and this reduces oxygen to your organs, thus reducing their ability to function properly. This could be why people with congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive cardiomyopathy, or stroke often experience fatigue.\r

\r

""What causes my feet to hurt when I stand up?\r

Answer: A lot of different factors play into causing foot pain, but one major factor is the imbalance of the muscles in your legs at rest. You probably have overactive quads—the big muscle on the backside of your leg closest to your tailbone—that get lots of work when you walk because they're stronger than your hamstrings, which control most of the motion. In contrast, many people's calves are weaker, allowing them to sway backwards when standing.\r

The usual course of action after radical mastectomy is:

A period of 10 to 12 months in which the patient is monitored regularly and receives regular chemo (injections of chemotherapy drugs). In other words, the patients have no control over how often they receive treatments. A new biopsy procedure may then be done every 6 months or so. It takes around 8 years for a woman with stage IV breast cancer to recover fully.

If the cancer has spread, either through lymph nodes (as with advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma), or through the breast ducts into the bone marrow and/or lungs, additional surgery may be needed. This could include mastectomies, liposuction, or removal of all the breast tissue except for the nipple, or the chest wall. Sometimes other treatments are required, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The longer a woman has had her tumors, the more likely she is to require further surgeries and treatments to eradicate the cancers.

Although there is no cure for MS, treatment includes medications and nutritional supplements that may help alleviate some of the disease's symptoms. In fact, the most widely used drugs for treating MS are beta blockers such as diltiazem (Imodium), lamotrigine (Lamictal), and primidone (Primobolan). Dietary changes also play an important role in managing the disease. Some of these dietary changes include reducing alcohol intake, limiting coffee, avoiding processed meats, and consuming at least six servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Other lifestyle changes such as taking care of your heart, keeping blood pressure in check, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and eating plenty of fresh fruit and vegetable foods and whole grains are also necessary to improve overall health.

gpt2-xl_1,"Chronic disease is one of the leading causes of death in industrialized societies today. It has a direct impact on personal well being and economic productivity. The three biggest categories of chronic conditions include: (1) cardiovascular disease; (2) type 2 diabetes mellitus; and (3) cancer. In addition, there are other ailments that affect people's lives such as infections, digestive problems, and mental illnesses. Each person responds differently to certain conditions because of genetic differences or environmental influences. For example, some people who are obese, have high blood pressure, are prone to chronic lung problems, or suffer from allergies may be able to take better care of themselves than others. The major risk factors for these diseases are excess weight, physical inactivity, poor diet, lack of exercise, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and inadequate sleep. Health problems associated with obesity can also lead to metabolic syndrome which is a combination of high blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, triglycerides, and low HDL levels. Cancer is caused by abnormal cells called tumors, and they grow uncontrolled when there is an imbalance between normal cell growth and apoptosis which occurs when cells stop dividing due to damage. This imbalance creates new tumor cells that eventually become malignant. Common cancers include prostate, breast, colon, rectum, ovarian, thyroid, kidney, pancreas, throat, skin, and head and neck. Many healthy individuals develop symptoms due to their own genetics but not everyone will experience any significant problems. Those with known predisposing factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, poor diet, and excessive alcohol intake are at highest risk. Some common lifestyle choices like eating foods rich in cholesterol, alcohol, trans fats, and processed meats increase your chances of developing chronic disease. Your best bet is to eat a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, fish, and healthy fats. To help you achieve this goal, consult a physician before making changes in your diet.

The only way you can be prepared for an unexpected question is by having written information on hand. You might ask your boss or the HR manager in charge of human resources to set up a meeting with him/her for this purpose. In addition, it's important that if your employer does find out that you're MS, they know what you do and don't disclose regarding your disability. They may make allowances as needed because they assume you'll continue doing your job as usual. That said, if you need special accommodations in order to perform your job, get them in writing before you tell your employer or try to take time off. Finally, keep in mind that you may not always be able to give the same answer to all questions related to your disability. If someone asks about your symptoms, you must explain the nature of your impairment; however, when trying to figure out which type of therapy would be most effective for me, for example, I usually won't necessarily know the specific treatment I'd prefer.

gpt2-xl_35,"Ketosis is the body's natural reaction to starvation or inadequate food intake. It is caused by an excessive production of ketone bodies (beta hydroxybutyrate) in the liver due to elevated levels of fatty acids produced from protein breakdown (the process known as lipolysis). Most people will naturally lose some body fat during periods of starvation because fat cells have a limited capacity to produce energy. Fat loss is necessary for keeping your blood sugar level under control. This can be achieved through increased physical activity, or by reducing calorie consumption so that you consume fewer calories overall than you burn. The ketogenic diet is one way to achieve this. An excess of beta hydroxybutyrate in the bloodstream causes a number of physiological changes including, but not limited to, a lower than normal blood glucose concentration, which leads to ketoacidosis and the unpleasant symptoms associated with it such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, weakness, confusion, abdominal cramps, and sometimes seizures or coma. A low blood glucose concentration also causes muscle and joint pain, fatigue, and depression, which may result in weight loss on a low carb, ketogenic diet. It should be noted that the ketogenic diet does not cause all of these symptoms; only those caused by a low carbohydrate diet. Because the body has many mechanisms that regulate glucose levels in the blood, a low carb diet has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity. In fact, many studies suggest that eating very few carbohydrates increases metabolism enough to allow the body to utilize dietary fat rather than glycogen for fuel. Many experts agree that most individuals who follow a ketogenic diet experience significant improvements in their quality of life.\r

""While there is no exact proof that consuming fat makes you healthier, the research suggests otherwise. While there is no specific scientific evidence proving that a low carb diet can prevent chronic disease, the general consensus among doctors is that eating more healthy fats and less saturated fat reduces risk factors related to heart disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity."" \r

""Although researchers continue to find beneficial effects of certain types of fat in our diets, they do not yet fully understand how fats interact with proteins, carbohydrates, and vitamins and minerals in ways that make them good or bad for us. Scientists have also discovered that many people respond best to different types of fats.

\r

Why does physical activity raise cholesterol?\r

Answer: Research shows that some people with high LDL (""bad"") cholesterol may be more likely than others to develop cardiovascular problems such as heart attacks and strokes in later life.

\r

How do I know if my HDL (""good"") cholesterol is too low?\r

Answer: If your triglycerides are elevated, then a healthy HDL ""cholesterol"" level should generally be at least 50 mg per deciliter (0.5 mmol/L).\r

How do I know if my LDL (""bad"") cholesterol is too high?\r

Answer: If your triglycerides are elevated, then a healthy LDL ""cholesterol"" level should usually be between 80 and 120 mg/dL (2.1 and 3.7 mmol/L), depending on age.\r

\r

What happens to my HDL and LDL when I lose weight?\r

Answer: Your HDL cholesterol will increase while your LDL will decrease. Losing weight reduces insulin resistance. As a result, your triglyceride levels will drop and HDL levels will rise. This process can take several weeks or months. During this time period, your doctor might recommend taking fibrates or statins to lower your LDL cholesterol and keep your HDL levels up.\r

One way to accomplish this goal is by reducing carbohydrates and eating more fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low glycemic index foods. In addition, it would be beneficial to avoid refined sugars, artificial sweeteners, refined flour and processed foods. Some good sources of healthy carbs include vegetables, legumes and fruit. Other foods to consider include soy products, nuts, seeds, dried beans and peas, oats, quinoa, and brown rice. You can also enjoy these foods while watching how many calories you consume each day so you know exactly where your calorie limit lies.

Some people find they need to add an extra few grams of carbohydrate per day to achieve their daily recommended calorie intake from carbohydrates, such as at least 100 grams. It may take some trial and error to discover how much carbs will work for you but once you do it is well worth trying.

Answer: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water after touching surfaces contaminated with fungi. If you have had a recent skin infection or fungus outbreak on your face, wash the affected area often with clean water. Avoid overusing deodorant products because they can mask any smell. A good place for bacteria to hide is under clothing. It also helps if you regularly change your underwear and socks so they don't harbor bacteria.\r

\nQuestion: When we run the toilet, is there any waste product left behind when the flushing action occurs?\r

Answer: No. The flush toilet acts like a sieve to filter out material deposited during use. In general, this material passes through the toilet bowl or outside the building before being flushed back into the sewer system.\r


Sewer lines are usually cleaned using water, bleach, or ammonia. They may be re-lined several times or replaced periodically depending upon their age and condition.\r

\nQuestion: Is toilet paper made of cotton?\r

Answer: Yes; most brands of toilet tissue come in 100% cotton.\r

\nQuestion: What should I do if my child has an ear infection?\r

Answer: Your child will need antibiotics within 48 hours, which should be given at room temperature, if possible. Do not give antibiotics directly to your child, however, as many people have died due to misdiagnosed ear infections. In addition, certain drugs used in children's medicine may cause dangerous side effects. These include: phenobarbital (Phenobarbitone), chloramphenicol (Chloramphenicol), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). However, if all else fails, consult your doctor for treatment recommendations.\r

The condition of the woman itself has also been linked to the onset of some of the complications. These include fibroids, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and miscarriage.\nQuestion: what is the normal menstrual cycle?\nComplete Answer: There is currently no standard method for determining the length of the normal menstruation period; however, the average length of menstruation usually ranges from 28 days at full menses until around menopause (approximately age 45 years). The time between ovulation and menstruation varies greatly among women due to differences in individual hormones and nutritional status.\nQuestion: what causes excessive bleeding during my periods?\nComplete Answer: This may be due to hormonal changes, pregnancy symptoms, or infection caused by bacteria such as candidiasis. It may occur more frequently when you are overweight. If your period starts suddenly after age 35, it could indicate an early onset of menopause. If your periods last longer than three months after stopping your birth control pill, they are likely due to excess estrogen.\nQuestion: do I need to take my pills every day to prevent heavy periods?\nComplete Answer: You should use your birth control pills consistently throughout your entire reproductive lifetime if you want to avoid heavy periods. Taking the pill daily does not protect against ovarian cancer; however, taking the pill daily reduces the risk of getting certain types of cancers such as breast and uterine (uterine) cancers. For this reason, many people choose to stop their birth control pill monthly or biweekly so that their periods do not become heavy and irregular. Women who start using oral contraceptives before the age of 18 can take them regularly as long as their periods remain lighter and less frequent.\nQuestion: when should I change my birth control pill schedule?\nComplete Answer: Do you have regular heavy periods? If yes, then switching your pill schedule to a weekly regimen will help reduce your chances of becoming pregnant. However, changing your pill schedule too frequently can make it harder to remember all of the dosage information for each new pack. Also, since you are already taking the same pills month to month, it can be difficult to adjust back to a new pill schedule if your current pill plan doesn't work well for you.\nQuestions: I am allergic to latex or any other ingredient in the pill.

gpt2-xl_63,"Multiple sclerosis is not expected to adversely impact your career as a physician, nurse, or healthcare professional. However, the disease may interfere with certain aspects of your job. For example, it can limit your ability to perform certain tasks because of muscle weakness, and you may have increased risk for falls and other accidents on your feet or in bed. If you suffer from MS, be sure to seek out a doctor or another qualified healthcare professional who knows how to help you manage these symptoms and prevent them from worsening. \nAnswer: How does MS affect people's sex lives?\nAnswer: A person with MS often has problems with sexual functioning, leading to lower libido, decreased interest in sex, and reduced desire for intercourse (when aroused). These effects occur after an initial period when many people appear to be fine sexually. At this stage of the disease, it's important that you don't stop having sexual relations until you've been diagnosed, treated, or found a cure. Even then, some men will still experience trouble during their sexuality. In addition, MS can cause chronic fatigue and general aches and pains. This can make your day-to-day life very difficult at times. \nAnswer: Why do I need treatment if I'm in good health?\nAnswer: It's easy for you to avoid getting MS by avoiding certain activities. But even healthy individuals may develop some level of symptoms that can negatively effect their quality of life, so they should consult with their doctor before starting any new activity (or quitting one that isn't necessary or that doesn't involve risk). The main objective of treatment is to slow down, reduce, or eliminate the symptoms, which may include pain, numbness/tingling sensations, visual disturbances, tingling, loss of feeling, fatigue, dizziness, sleep disorders, and depression (which could lead to suicidal thoughts or behavior). Treatment also includes medications to treat blood clots (venous thromboembolism) and to lessen inflammation (arthritis), to improve vision, balance, memory, strength, and coordination. \nAnswer: What else can happen with MS?\nAnswer: When you're ill with MS, you may feel depressed, anxious, sad, lonely, or empty. Sometimes, you may think you might lose control of your mind and become violent. Many people with MS report experiencing feelings of guilt, shame, anxiety, self-doubt, low self-esteem, confusion, hopelessness, helplessness, and despair.

It affects millions worldwide; some people with MS have no symptoms but others experience severe disability and even death.\r

\u201d Multiple sclerosis typically develops during childhood or adolescence. There are several factors that influence how likely it will develop, including environmental exposures such as infections (including pneumonia), genetics, age at first infection and exposure to other viruses, medications, diseases and conditions, and infections caused by bacteria.

I asked why she doesn't just tell her patients ""don't eat red meat"". She says, ""It's not appropriate for people who deal with this topic on a day to day basis."" And I say, ""why?""

She gives me two reasons. First, she thinks people can get riled up when they hear the word ""meat"" because they associate red meat with meat products in general. Second, and more importantly, she claims that her patients don't want to go through the cognitive dissonance of saying things like, ""the brain is supposed to control this part of your body. Why do my nerves work so badly? And what can I do to make them better?""

This was the most telling example of why I decided to write this post.

When I told her that my gut reaction was similar to hers, she seemed disappointed. She said, ""it's sad to see what happened to your mother."" Well, yes. But also, I would guess that many of us feel very similar feelings about our parents. We love them dearly and want everything we could possibly ask for. When we read articles like Dr. Kleinman's, it makes us wonder if something is really wrong with our children and ourselves.

In addition to making us question what is going on inside of us, stories such as those in the New York Times perpetuate an unhealthy idea that eating meat is good for you.

gpt2-xl_52,"Mental Health Problems \nCommon mental health conditions include depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance abuse disorders, eating disorders, and personality disorders.\

Mental illnesses are complex, but they may be caused by physical or emotional factors such as depression, anemia, chronic pain, etc.. There is no specific cure for any of these illnesses. For example, depression is typically not cured with drugs, even if you take them. However, there are medications that can help decrease symptoms, like antidepressants. In addition, research suggests that medication alone does not work well in treating all cases, and it's possible that some people respond better to psychotherapy.\r


Other mental illness symptoms that might be present include hallucinations, delusions, severe headaches, obsessive thoughts, insomnia, poor concentration, and difficulty sleeping. These symptoms may seem minor at first, but over time, they become more debilitating and often cause significant problems. If left untreated, mental illness will eventually develop into a full-blown psychiatric condition called schizophrenia. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD, substance abuse disorders, and personality disorders can also lead to serious complications, including suicidal behavior, self-injury, drug use, eating disorders, sexual dysfunction, and criminal behavior.\r

What questions do patients ask online?

Many mental health users have questions that go beyond the basics of their health condition. Patients want information on everything from how to start treatment to whether they should pursue certain types of therapy. Patients want guidance on things like diet, exercise, and social situations. They also want to know when to seek support, and what kinds of resources are available for them. The internet has made it easier than ever before for consumers to find information about mental health, so patients are able to choose providers who offer assistance and advice based on their personal needs. Many patients are able to find support in groups focused around particular issues such as suicide prevention, healthy relationships, and coping skills for dealing with depression or anxiety.\r

How much time do patients spend searching for information online?

A recent study found that approximately 50 percent of Americans used the Internet to view medical images, videos, and other information related to their own health. Another study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that nearly 35 percent of adults use the Internet to look up information about their current or past medical care.\r

The American Psychiatric Association has published the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which lists treatment interventions to treat depressive disorders. These include therapy, medication (such as antidepressants, mood stabilizers, or electroconvulsive therapy), and lifestyle changes, among others. Many experts believe that the combination of these therapies helps people who struggle with the disease achieve better functioning while also reducing its severity and duration. If you need specific guidance regarding your particular situation, consider consulting a professional. A list of resources is available at: http://www.psychiatryonline.org/depression_treatment.html\n Questions: What should I eat before taking antidepressants?\nAnswer: According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it is generally safe to take antidepressants before a meal. Some doctors recommend waiting 10 minutes after eating, though others strongly caution against eating immediately before taking antidepressants. Even so, eating before taking an antidepressant is unlikely to cause side effects and may actually provide you with the nutrients needed during the day. Most studies show that eating within 30 minutes of taking a drug improves appetite and decreases withdrawal signs. However, you should check with your doctor first about whether you should consume food with the medication to ensure that this won't interfere with your treatment.\r",114,borderline personality disorder symptoms,-6.675809860229492,55,multimedqa,4,0.5092592592592593,390,6

4. Can I read more quickly by looking at printed words instead of pictures?

5. What kinds of problems can occur with children who use computers or the Internet?\nAnswer: First, there is no ""right"" answer to these questions. They all depend on a variety of factors - your personal needs, the age of your child, and the type of computer or computer service he uses. The key is to determine what kind of assistance you need from a qualified professional\nand then follow the steps above to choose the best solution based upon those specific circumstances.\nFor example, if your child uses an electronic device and occasionally checks the Web, this may not be as severe a problem as using a computer regularly while playing video games (which will lead to long-term effects). If, however, your child has difficulty understanding texts or simply doesn't like learning, she might benefit greatly from having her reading skills assessed. \nSecond, the symptoms of reading problems are often caused by other physical or mental conditions which should be considered before considering any treatment. Also, each person has different strengths and weaknesses when it comes to reading, so it is essential to discuss any concerns with your doctor or specialist and work through any problems together.\nThird, there are over-the-counter and prescription medications available to treat some types of reading difficulties. These include nonprescription agents such as ocrelizumab or valsartan, which have been shown to reduce eye irritation in patients suffering from certain diseases and disorders that cause excessive tear production. Other medication treatments include the antihistamine diphenhydramine (Benadryl), which reduces eye itching; the anticholinergic drug propranolol, which helps relieve sleepiness during the daytime; and fluoxetine, which helps increase attention span and calmness in depressed patients. \nFourth, if you have problems with reading comprehension, a test called the Raven Progressive Matrices provides a measure of reading ability.

Some frames for men are actually narrower than those for women so that they can be worn together without interfering with each other's vision. Most frames come with a variety of lenses, ranging from clear to colored frames, along with sunglasses. There are now a number of options available to try before buying so go ahead and explore some online shopping!

gpt2-xl_92,"\nFitness and the brain\nMS is characterized by weakness of the central nervous system. This can affect balance, coordination, mood and ability to concentrate.\r

In MS, there can be changes in the structure of neurons within the spinal cord. This may cause the patient's muscles or nerves to become weaker. A weakened central nervous system can increase susceptibility to fatigue from any source such as exercise, illness, toxins, trauma, sleep deprivation, infections, depression, medication side effects, etc.\r

Other factors that can weaken the CNS include age, gender, genetics (including hypothyroidism), environmental exposures (e.g., drugs, radiation exposure, tobacco smoke) and certain medications such as those used for epilepsy. \r


What is FIT?\r

FIT stands for Functional Imaging Training. FIT provides training materials on how to perform functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The goal of these exercises is to help participants better understand what they see during fMRI scans and then use this information in their daily lives and clinical practice. In addition to improving participants' understanding of fMRI, FIT also focuses on improving their skills using techniques that improve accuracy and reproducibility in image processing. These techniques include multiple-regression analysis, segmentation, group comparisons, cluster enlargement, automated segmentation, thresholding, statistical tests, regression analysis and classification, image normalization and transformation, signal enhancement, visualization, data reduction and presentation, and more. By doing these types of training exercises, participants have the opportunity to gain valuable practical expertise and new techniques necessary to conduct research and develop improved diagnostic tools.

How does fMRI work?

Functional MRI (fMRI) measures blood flow through an area of the brain while subjects view pictures that appear on a computer screen and move one of two cursor keys. As the participant moves the mouse over the images, the volume of each area of interest increases or decreases based on whether the region is active or not (active regions contain greater activity than non-active areas). Scientists use this information to determine if the area has changed due to physical damage or disease. At this time, fMRI cannot detect every kind of change in the body but it can identify the patterns of neural activation associated with specific conditions or diseases. An fMRI study often involves hundreds of participants and many thousands",92,causes of fatigue in MS,-0.9262322187423706,15,multimedqa,4,0.06696428571428571,382,20

Mental Health Issues: The First Step \n Question: What do I need to know about mental illness?\nComplete Answer: If you think you might be suffering from mental illnesses, start by finding out what these terms mean.\nFor example, depression means low mood, anxiety disorder means feeling anxious all the time and schizophrenia means having unusual thoughts. It also helps to understand how they're different from each other. In general, mental disorders occur when there's something wrong with your brain that makes you feel sad, scared, angry, or depressed.\r

gpt2-xl_86,"This is a disease in which the immune system attacks the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers.\nQ2: Primary or secondary?\nAnswer: The two main types of MS are primary or secondary; they occur in roughly equal numbers among people diagnosed with MS.\nQ3: What causes MS?\nAnswer: People who have MS may develop it from damage caused by an autoimmune attack on the nervous system triggered when proteins called autoantigens — substances that normally act as ""weapons"" against invading viruses — start attacking the body's own tissues. In some people, a single trigger can cause the development of both forms of MS.\nQ4: How does MS progress?\nAnswer: As your body tries to repair itself after exposure to a first immune response (called an antibody reaction) that triggers autoimmunity, new antibodies become stronger and more numerous. Eventually, you begin to experience symptoms similar to those associated with MS. Symptoms include fatigue, muscle weakness, vision problems, balance disorders, sleep problems and trouble thinking clearly. Some people also have difficulty swallowing or breathing, but these conditions usually improve over time.\nQ5: Why is treatment so important for treating MS?\nAnswer: Treatment begins with the diagnosis. It's not uncommon for some patients to be misdiagnosed because their symptoms don't seem like signs or symptoms of MS. Also, many people believe they will get better on their own if they just take medicine. But often these treatments do nothing and only make things worse. Therefore, doctors must diagnose you before beginning any type of treatment, such as drugs, surgery, corticosteroid injections or other therapies, such as acupuncture. They might even recommend surgical procedures, such as neurosurgery, if they think your condition cannot be improved by existing medication.\nQ6: Does MS affect others?\nAnswer: Yes, according to one study involving 856 participants with MS. Those who were treated with either steroids or interferon beta did significantly better than those given neither treatment. However, it should be noted that this study focused on the effects of steroid therapy on the skin and did not examine its effect on nerves within the spinal cord. Although there haven't been enough studies done yet to show whether steroids work differently on the brain compared to nerves, researchers say that steroids could possibly help reduce the activity of certain neurotransmitters, thereby affecting the nervous system.\nQ7: Is it possible to cure MS?\nAnswer: Not likely.",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-2.2317354679107666,56,multimedqa,4,0.42105263157894735,384,0

gpt2-xl_72,"The CDC has not studied the safety of the Covid-19 vaccine in children and adults with MS. Because of this study's small sample size and lack of scientific evidence, the Agency does not recommend routine use of the vaccine in these individuals.\r

\nAnswer: The recommended dose is 1 mL (0.12 mL/kg) intramuscularly or 0.5 mL subcutaneously once every 6 months for 4 years.[7] This number can vary by individual based on the severity of their disease and how long they have been taking medications and supplements.[8] To date, no studies involving the safety of the Vaccinia virus strain have been published.[9][10] There have also been questions regarding whether patients who have received the vaccine may be more susceptible to influenza viruses than those that did not receive the vaccine.[11]. Therefore, it is best to discuss the benefits and risks associated with vaccinating against flu or other illnesses with your physician prior to receiving the vaccination.[12]

The Vaccinia virus strain contains human papillomavirus and some strains contain human herpesvirus type 14. Each of the vaccines available contains elements from both species, with HPV being the most prevalent form of HPV infection. In addition, many HPV types do not cause cancer, but rather genital warts. Some HPV types can also trigger cervical cancer, especially in women who were previously infected with an HPV type known as HPV16, which was included in the original HPV4 vaccine. However, there is growing concern over the increase of infections caused by the HPV18-related virus type 6, which causes precancerous lesions that resemble genital warts. These precancerous lesions typically occur several years before the symptoms of cervical cancer appear.[13] For more information please see: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6533a2.htm.

It is important to realize that there are several different types of MS; the most common type is relapsing-remitting (RRM), which typically starts in middle age and progresses over time. RRMs tend to be milder than primary progressive MS (PPMS). These two types of MS often coexist.

Q1: What is a spondylolisthesis?\nAnswer: A spondylolisthesis is where one or both of your lower back bones (""sponds"") become fused together after an injury occurs. An example would be if you had a fall, accident, trauma, surgery or another event that damages the lower back. The result could be fusion, dislocations, ligament tears and/or stress fractures. Spinal fusion in this case might lead to lower back pain, instability or even spinal cord compression. You might also experience pain in a joint called atlantoaxial joint or hip dislocation. Spinal fusion results in permanent changes to your spine and your body.\r

Q2: How can I tell whether I'm having a spinal fusion?\r

A2: A physical exam and x-ray will help determine the extent of the injury and whether it needs treatment. If you're having treatment, your doctor will perform an evaluation.

gpt2-xl_117,"It is important for patients with metastatic disease to get the best possible prognosis from their physicians. There are three types of outcomes that can occur in this stage of cancer: (1) remission; (2) recurrence or spread beyond initial site; and (3) death (or ""mortality""). In general, patients with advanced disease who have failed to respond adequately to standard therapy will be diagnosed as having relapsed. As long as treatment remains available, however, most relapse cases can be managed effectively by improving the patient's quality of life through lifestyle changes such as exercise or dietary modifications.\

In many instances, relapses may not lead to treatment failure but rather into successful progression through multiple stages of management. The most common reason for a patient's relapse is an inability to follow the diet and physical activity recommendations made by his or her physician. If it becomes evident that you cannot live on your current diet and training regimen, then your doctor should begin to evaluate other options. The main consideration when deciding whether you need further evaluation is whether the relapse is the result of a biological response to the treatment plan rather than the treatment itself.

Surgeon Answers A patient with metastatic breast cancer has been admitted to our hospital for treatment of advanced metastases. Is the patient going through chemotherapy? What is the expected duration of treatment? Answer: The typical course of chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer is six months. With chemotherapy, we aim to kill all the abnormal cells in the tumor so that the body can start the healing process again. This means we use chemotherapy drugs which make cancers grow faster. They also affect the liver and lungs. Patients usually take two to four cycles of these treatments. These cycles last between three weeks and eight weeks, depending upon how much time they have left before surgery. For example, if a woman had five years before the operation, she would be treated every three to four weeks until the surgery. However, women have the option to go longer before surgery. At this point, they could continue to take one cycle per month. Or they can choose to continue taking a continuous dose of chemotherapy in order to ensure they remain within a certain tolerance range. Chemotherapy does not directly kill all of the cancer cells inside the tumor, only those that are outgrowing the surrounding tissue. So after just six months of therapy, most tumors have virtually disappeared, making them difficult to treat.

You will find out which treatments are right for you through counseling and testing at the time of diagnosis. Some people choose to wait until after surgery before getting any treatment. Others choose to take their medicine immediately when it's available, rather than waiting for months until all available drugs have been tested for safety and effectiveness. While the exact timing depends on each person, most people with early stage disease should begin taking their medication within three to five days after their diagnosis. However, certain cancers -- especially those of the uterus -- require immediate therapy. Once started, treatment options include hormone replacement therapies (hormone therapy), surgical removal of the tumor, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or stem cell transplantation.

gpt2-xl_108,"Chronic diarrhea is the most commonly diagnosed form of food intolerance in North America. It affects more than 20 million people around the world. You may experience symptoms when you eat foods that contain an enzyme called lactase that helps digest milk products, especially cow's milk. These digestive problems cause bloating, diarrhea (often accompanied by vomiting), cramping, pain, constipation, abdominal discomfort, weight loss, fatigue, headache, or dizziness. The digestive symptoms often resolve on their own within one day after your first meal without further treatment. However, some individuals do not have normal gut bacteria and still suffer from this condition. If you suspect you may be suffering from chronic diarrhea, consult with your physician. If you don't have any symptoms or can't remember what happened before you became ill, you probably did not get sick because you ate an item containing lactose or another nutrient that was missing in the dairy product. The reason for these conditions is unknown, but it could be that your intestinal tract has been altered due to poor nutrition, such as malnutrition, antibiotic use, trauma, smoking, high stress levels, environmental contamination, and other causes. This could explain why you had diarrheal symptoms instead of nausea. \u003c\/span\u003e \u003cp class=\""p1\""\u003eThe exact mechanism behind this condition remains unclear, although several theories exist. Certain types of bacteria living in your intestines break down lactose into glucose, which is then absorbed into your bloodstream for energy. Some studies suggest that Lactobacillus acidophilus or Streptococcus thermophilus (both found in yogurt) reduce the amount of lactose absorbed into the bloodstream. Others believe that certain enzymes in the mouth help break down lactose into smaller molecules so they're easier absorbed by your cells. In addition, there are many cases of individuals who report having chronic diarrhea but never actually consumed any fermented milk product, such as kefir or cheese. Because these individuals are lactose intolerant, their bodies may also produce lactic acid in response to an overabundance of sugar in the blood. However, no scientific evidence supports this theory at this time. Another explanation for the problem is that too much bacteria in the gut (and possibly other organs) means that the body becomes overwhelmed with lactose. It turns out that the stomach and small intestine handle large amounts of sugars very well. So if bacteria in the gut cannot process the lactose properly, it ends up in your stools where it binds together",108,chronic diarrhea short-term memory sweating inability to regulate body temperature heart palpitations dysautonomia,-5.369433879852295,6,multimedqa,4,0.1016949152542373,401,9

gpt2-xl_126,"The correct answer is ""Yes"". A woman's basal body temperature (BBT) rises during ovulation. This rise in BBT affects the production of a hormone called luteinizing hormone (LH). LH stimulates the release of FSH, which causes the ovaries to produce an egg that will be released from the ovary after a few days.

It was thought that if you did not want your period to happen because you were using oral contraceptives, you should avoid eating or drinking anything containing folic acid as this could interfere with the hormones produced by the pituitary gland and cause high blood levels of it. However, there are several different types of folic acid available on the market that have been proven safe for long-term use. One type, Niacinamide is more effective than other forms of folic acid in blocking ovulation. It also prevents some miscarriages. Folate is needed to make red blood cells. When it is missing it can lead to anemia. If you are pregnant, taking folic acid supplements may lower your chances of having a child with Down syndrome, but there has been no convincing evidence to show its effectiveness on this basis. Birth control pills may reduce fertility in women who take them for longer periods, however, many studies show that taking a daily pill does not affect the ability to become pregnant. Although one study suggested that one particular kind of pill might help increase the likelihood of becoming pregnant.\r


What You Should Know


The most commonly used form of birth control is oral contraceptive pills. They contain three active ingredients: estrogen, progestin, and a small amount of the amino acid levonorgestrel (also known as norethindrone), which works by inhibiting ovulation. This method of contraception has the least side effects compared with other methods of contraception. There are two main problems associated with birth control pills: the risks of irregular bleeding and weight gain. Irregular bleeding occurs when the pregnancy test falls short of showing pregnancy; it may start within the first 24 hours after intercourse. While all types of birth control cause weight gain, the Pill does so at higher rates than any other method. Some studies suggest that over time the risk of gaining too much weight increases. These effects may be temporary or permanent. For example, certain kinds of antidepressants may make women feel like they're gaining fat even though their actual size hasn't changed.

Q: How does my body work?\nAnswer: Your body works because it is made up of trillions of cells called cells. Cellular processes include moving oxygen around your blood vessels, breaking down food into nutrients, making proteins and hormones, regulating your metabolism and providing energy to other parts of the body. While every cell in your body performs these functions exactly the same way, some cells have different ways of doing them than others. For example, white blood cells carry out specific tasks, like fighting infections or stopping viruses, while red blood cells help you fight against infections and keep your organs healthy. Learn more about what makes each type of cell do what they do, how cancer cells work, and why cancer is so deadly.


How does my body make insulin?\nAnswer: Insulin is one of three types of hormones produced in your pancreas, along with glucagon and somatostatin. These hormone are secreted into your bloodstream when certain foods stimulate your cells to produce glucose from carbohydrates (glucose being the main sugar found in food), or when glucose levels drop too low in the blood. Glucose levels rise after eating foods containing carbohydrates, and remain high until the next meal comes along. These hormones then tell your cells to use protein to create glycogen and release stored glucose into the bloodstream.

Answer: There are some things you can do to help reduce the itchiness associated with MS (more below).\r

The itching itself can sometimes get better without medication. \r

A few people find relief through the use of herbal remedies. This can involve using hot or cold teas or extracts. If you continue to experience discomfort when taking the herbs, please contact your doctor. Also, keep in mind that many supplements have no proven benefit in reducing the itchiness of MS. They may actually cause more problems. For example, supplements containing ephedra and ginseng do not seem to relieve MS symptoms at all.\r

Some people report success using coconut oil and essential oils to relieve their chronic pain. Please contact your doctor or pharmacist if you have trouble finding relief from these products.\r

What are the characteristics of triple negative breast cancer?\r

\r

Q. What are the characteristics of triple negative breast cancer?\r\nA. The characteristic that distinguishes triple negative from other kinds of breast cancers is its ability to hide tumors through the use of an abnormal protein called PD-1. This protein protects cells during normal cell growth processes. However, when PD-1 is inhibited by certain drugs or radiation, the tumors grow unchecked, which leads to them becoming resistant to chemotherapy.\r

The main purpose of PD-1 inhibitors is to stop tumor growth while allowing normal cells to continue dividing freely. However, as PD-1 inhibitors become less effective over time, some patients develop resistance. In such cases, other strategies must be used to suppress the tumors and prevent metastasis.


Accordingly, doctors often administer a drug called docetaxel (Vayarin®) before radiotherapy in order to block PD-1 activity on the surface of malignant cells so they cannot evade destruction. If docetaxel becomes ineffective or there are no suitable PD-1 inhibitors available, then chemotherapy may be administered instead. For these reasons, triple negative breast cancer is one of the most difficult kinds of breast cancer for physicians to diagnose accurately.\r

Other characteristics include a slow rate of tumor progression and poor prognosis. Therefore, triple negative breast cancer is not usually treated aggressively; it is typically treated with hormone therapy until the disease has progressed into stages 2 or 3. When stage 1 disease progresses, radiation treatment is given. Once stage 2 or 3 disease develops, surgery may be considered if certain criteria are met.


Because triple negative breast cancer tends to be particularly aggressive, it is best to receive regular follow up examinations by a specialist at least every 5 years.",118,stage 4 triple negative breast cancer treatment,-0.0083087254315614,0,multimedqa,5,0.0,338,34

What is the Ketosis Diet?

The ketosis diet (KD) is a dietary therapy used as a lifestyle modification program for Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM). It uses fat restriction and a higher carbohydrate intake, specifically as a result of high glycemic index foods such as wheat, potatoes, pasta, breads, rice, nuts, seeds, dairy products, sweeteners, etc., but does not include any other sources of protein, which would also increase the risk for T2DM. In contrast, the Atkins Diet has a lower carbohydrate intake (<40g daily), but includes some animal proteins, thus lowering the risk for T2DM. Both diets have been shown to reduce the glycaemic response to a meal in both diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. However, the KD differs from the Atkins Diet in that it encourages a reduction in the amount of carbohydrate-containing foods and therefore may lead to greater body weight loss during the first 2 weeks compared to the Atkins Diet. Additionally, the KD restricts the total amount of carbs, including sugars, that can be eaten on one day. This should encourage low carb eating habits throughout the week.

A person on the KD will typically consume a relatively large dose of fats, usually up to 80% of their calorie needs. On average, the individual on the KD will not eat a lot of protein (about 30% of calories), nor do they have much energy. However, if you follow these guidelines, you will notice dramatic improvements in your symptoms. Many of the benefits of the KD include:

Some people who take high doses of vitamin B12 for many years develop anemia, which can lead to permanent damage to organs. In addition to getting enough vitamin B12 in your diet, you should get enough vitamin B12 through dietary means. You can help ensure that you get enough vitamin B12 by eating fortified foods like fortified breakfast cereals and milk, as well as by using fortified multivitamins and vitamin pills.

Try to get at least 30 minutes of daily exercise on some sort of steady, soft surface. If you can't stand up straight or sit upright for an extended period, it may be necessary to consult with a physician. It's also a good idea if you are looking to lose weight. Your body needs to burn calories by moving around. For example, doing some yoga will help increase circulation to all areas of your body. As far as exercising while seated, there isn't anything that really helps you exercise more efficiently. However, sitting down frequently will make you feel more relaxed than standing up for long periods of time. In fact, standing up a lot may actually cause your muscles to tighten up and cause other symptoms associated with tight muscles. There are many different types of yoga. You might find one workout helpful; however, you may want to experiment with different poses to see what works best for you. \nQuestion: diet tips\nAnswer: When shopping for food products, always look for ingredients made from whole foods. All foods contain vitamins and minerals in varying amounts. Some foods have low levels of nutrients while others are high. By limiting certain food groups, you'll limit the amount of nutrient waste that ends up in landfills. Food manufacturers don't need to worry too much about proper nutrition. They use whatever they think the market wants to buy at any given moment, regardless of whether it is healthy. Some companies put their own fillers into their foods to make them taste better and sell more--this is called ""convenience food."" Another reason why companies add these additives to junk food is because their profits depend upon it.\r

What You Should Know About Nutrition\r

Nutrition is vital to maintaining good health. Every day we consume hundreds of thousands of chemicals that are not listed on the labels of our packaged goods. These chemical compounds are toxic. Not only are these chemicals harmful to us directly, but they are often used to produce chemical toxins to be used against us later on in life. When you eat a product labeled ""100% natural,"" you usually end up consuming a large dose of artificial chemicals.

I thought it was an incredible statement; therefore, I decided I needed to write an article that would explain exactly how I came up with this idea. Therefore, I wrote a short article called How I Came Up With My Dream and included it in my blog.

That is why it takes a true spiritual awakening to accomplish anything worthwhile."" And here is what I said:""We live in a world filled with lies... I'm not talking about just the government.

Question: Is a tattoo permanent?\r

\r

Answer: TATTOOS ARE NOT PERMANENT. Many people think they are. They should be ashamed of themselves! Most tattoos are temporary, lasting only a few months, but some can last several years. Just because a tattoo has faded does not mean it's permanently gone. You may see temporary spots, which are merely normal aging of the skin, in your new tattoo. The best thing to do if you notice any changes is to ask your doctor to take a look at your tattoo. \r

Question: I've been told that sunscreen prevents sunburns. What about a watertight hat and sunglasses?\r

\r

Answer: Sunscreen acts by blocking out harmful rays from the sun. That includes UVB rays which cause tanning. It also blocks out UVA rays, which cause premature wrinkling of the skin and burns. There have long been studies showing that wearing protective clothing (shorts, hats) and applying sunscreen reduces sunburn rates among adults. The bottom line is that sunscreen works wonders. Unfortunately, using sunscreen every day isn't always necessary. Your chances of getting burned go up the longer you spend outside without it. In fact, we recommend that all adults wear sunscreen at least once daily in order to reduce your risk of developing skin cancer. To protect against burn damage, a hat made of polyester fibers provides greater protection than a cotton one. If you decide to use a hat instead of sunscreen, make sure you don't leave the brim open when going outdoors. Another factor that increases the chance of burn is the temperature of the environment inside your car. Keep in mind that the sun burns faster and deeper the closer you get to the equator.

Answer: \u201cMultiple Sclerosis (MS)\"" says MS-UK on its website. \""This is not a disease where one day you have a sudden onset of illness, nor does it appear suddenly at any time. In fact it starts years before – often as soon as someone graduates from high school and becomes employed, or even when they attend university.\"" \u201dThere are three types of MS - relapsing/remitting (MSR), primary progressive (PP) and secondary progressive (SP). Each type has different symptoms and treatment options. Relapses are generally defined as the return of MS symptoms within 6 months. The main symptom in PP MS is weakness or numbness in both arms or legs that occurs 2-5 times per month. The symptoms usually become worse over 3-4 days then disappear completely. SP MS typically begins with a few small spots called demyelinating lesions appearing in the brain and spine. These rapidly progress and cause more damage until lesions cover large areas of the body. Symptoms include severe headaches, muscle weakness, impaired vision, trouble swallowing, blurred vision, hearing problems, and involuntary movements. There is no cure for any type of MS but there are treatments available. Talk to your doctor about what is best for you.\r

The IUD has two pieces of flexible plastic called threads, which can be removed after intercourse. After removal of one piece of thread, the other remains inside the body, like a small Tic Tac ring. If you have had unprotected sex since your last use of contraception, you may need to change your method of protection for 1 month before using another type of birth control such as condoms, spermicides, or a diaphragm.\nQuestion: How long does it take an IUD to work?\nComplete Answer: It depends on many factors including: the brand and model of IUD; how frequently you have intercourse; what position and if any you're currently using; whether you've been sexually active recently with men who aren't married or living together; and whether your provider is familiar with and uses the right type of IUD. Because there's no way to predict how long an individual will get pregnant while using an IUD, all women should make sure they know their best course of action if anything unexpected happens during insertion, even if the process feels uncomfortable or painful.\nQuestion: What do I do if my IUD won't stay in place?\nComplete Answer: Contact your provider immediately and tell her you want to remove your IUD or have it removed. Even if your provider doesn't seem surprised by your request, she'll likely ask some questions first, especially if you're having difficulty pulling out the IUD or if the IUD isn't making it much easier. Once you've answered those questions satisfactorily, you might have your IUD removed without any issues occurring. Your provider may also perform a pelvic exam, ultrasound, or blood test.

Why we picked this question

While Apple has never issued an official statement regarding the existence of third party software monitoring features within iOS 9, it appears from a number of sources (including our own internal testing) that Apple may indeed include some kind of option to enable such functionality in future versions of OS X. This is not only because of potential privacy concerns over tracking users across multiple devices, but because there is no doubt that current usage patterns support this function being available. Additionally, given the widespread use of iMessage, which includes both the ability to send text messages directly through the Messages application and to receive SMS alerts via iMessage itself, it would not surprise us at all to see third party messaging applications being integrated into the system. Of course, as noted above, this functionality could potentially allow companies like Google to access data concerning users of its products — but at least in theory, this shouldn't matter since it wouldn't necessarily be possible for Google to actually track any messages sent through its service. In practice, however, it seems unlikely that this feature would really become widely used outside of those situations where it might have legal implications (and, I imagine, Apple would probably want to avoid those kinds of issues).

Long term effects of the aging process include an increased risk for many chronic diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disease. Certain cancers can also be caused by aging as well as other life-threatening conditions that often develop later in life like diabetes, osteoporosis or heart failure. The increase in risks is not limited to those of old age but applies to children too (see section entitled ""Children"" below). Long-term effects of aging include an increased rate of death from some causes and increasing rates of disability due to others. A person's overall survival depends on a number of factors, including their age at onset, length of time since diagnosis and underlying illness. For example, a 60 year old who developed cancer two years ago and had been healthy until then may now die within three months because he was diagnosed with early stage cancer in his late 50s. On the flip side, if a 40 year old patient shows no ill effect from his recent bout of prostate cancer then it seems likely that prostate cancer will have become inactive over the past five years which would mean his chances of dying during the next 5 years is zero. If the same man had been treated in childhood and developed cancer only 3 months after diagnosis, his chance of surviving 10 years would have risen to less than 1%. There is no simple answer to whether one should get treatment before or after the development of illness or whether any given person has sufficient time to overcome the negative consequences of aging before making such decisions. However, there are ways that people can take steps to improve their overall quality of life while avoiding or delaying the more serious adverse effects of aging.

Answer: The American Medical Association defines the diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis as follows:

<1 year old : No evidence of disease; no signs, symptoms, or laboratory findings; normal results of physical exam. <5 years old : Evidence of disease; signs, symptoms, or laboratory findings consistent with MS (e.g., difficulty walking, numbness, tingling, weakness, slurred speech). 5-10 years old : Signs, symptoms, or laboratory findings suggestive of MS (e.g., increased strength or coordination, decreased movement, visual disturbances, loss of balance, difficulties speaking). 10-19 years old : Symptoms consistent with MS, but abnormal results on standard neurological examination. >20 years old: Normal results on standard neurological examination \u2013 however, most children who will develop MS won't have any symptoms until they're older than 20 years old.\r Answer: Your doctor will check your body for signs of MS before making a diagnosis.

A person's chances of developing MS can be lowered by taking immunosuppressive medications such as steroids or corticosteroids before they develop severe symptoms. However, people who have not had previous attacks of MS may still develop it if they take certain medications that interfere with their immune system's ability to recognize foreign invaders. These include some types of antibiotics like ciprofloxacin (Cipro) which may cause permanent damage to your liver or kidneys; penicillin (Pen); macrolides like azithromycin (Zithromax); azole antifungal drugs like ketoconazole (Nizoral); fluconazole (Tampanel), minocycline (Minocin); sulfasalazine (Erythromycin). In addition, it is possible for you to get MS even though you've never been diagnosed with the condition.\r

\r

What causes MS?\r

MS is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by the body's own immune system attacking its own tissue. It can affect many parts of the body in different ways including the brain, spinal cord, optic nerve, joints, skin and eyes. The exact causes are unknown but research indicates that several factors could contribute to the development of this condition.\r

\r

Who gets MS?\r

The risk of getting MS varies among individuals based on environmental factors, genetics, sex, age, family history of the condition, the amount of inflammation present in the tissues, how much inflammation there is, exposure to toxins, and other biological factors. When you're young, the risk of developing MS may seem higher because of the relative ease of acquiring the disorder. As you grow older, your risk of developing MS declines because you build up more of your own natural defenses against invading bacteria and viruses. Research has also shown that genetic factors influence whether someone develops MS early or late in life. Certain genes predispose people to a higher incidence of MS while others increase their risk of developing it later in life. Some studies have suggested that the presence of these inherited genes explains why most people do not develop MS during childhood \r

If you experience any of these symptoms after taking a medication, call your doctor immediately. It is important to tell your doctor exactly what happened so he/she knows how to manage the problem. \nQuestion: antibiotic\/antibiotic resistant infections\nAnswer: Common bacterial infections such as colds, sore throats, urinary tract infections, and chest infections. Antimicrobial resistance happens when bacteria become resistant to antibiotics. This means they no longer kill most strains of microbes, but still cause problems. The more antibiotics people use to treat infections, the greater their risk of developing a resistant infection. Some of the bacteria that grow resistant to drugs include Staphylococcus aureus (staph), Escherichia coli (E.coli) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.aeruginosa). These bacteria usually don't cause serious illness unless you have other underlying conditions. However, you could get very sick if you aren't treated fast enough. \nQuestion: blood clotting disorders\nAnswer: Blood clots occur when two blood vessels — the carotid artery and vein — break off from the main vessel (the arteries) of your heart. They can happen during surgery, physical exertion, pregnancy or childbirth, and heavy lifting. Your doctor may order tests to determine whether there is a problem before making a decision about a possible procedure. Most commonly, clots occur in the legs when someone stands up too quickly after sitting for long periods or walking over uneven terrain.

The AOA website provides additional information regarding eye care for adults and children with special needs. This includes guidelines for choosing an appropriate prescription lens choice, as well as advice for selecting and fitting corrective lenses. Eyeglasses may be considered high risk if they cause symptoms like redness or irritation when worn by people who have diabetes, heart disease, stroke, certain cancers, liver diseases, kidney disease, or other conditions that can affect vision. Some eyewear also may not protect against the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. For example, many sunglasses prevent UV light from reaching the retina but do nothing to shield your eyes from UV radiation from sunlight. Even when these types of eyewear provide protection from the sun, they can still reduce your vision because they limit how much sunlight reaches the back of your eyeball. These limitations in vision are known as retinal detachment. If you experience problems with seeing after wearing eyewear, consider getting some new glasses. If your doctor recommends a different type of prescription lens, he or she might recommend reading the AOA's ""Optical Safety Guide,"" published in 2002. To learn more, see our contact us page.


Why would someone go out of their way to get my prescription?

When someone purchases glasses online, the process usually involves paying a small fee through PayPal so the company can verify your identity and ensure that you're over 18 years old. Once they confirm that you're over 18, they then send your prescription to your local optometrist, who uses your signature on the letter to fill it out. Your local optometrist will typically charge $20-$25 to get your prescription filled. After that happens, there is no need to call again! There are many websites available where you can buy glasses without making a trip to the office — you just put in your name and address, choose the model and size you want, and pay via credit card.

Can I use any prescription lenses while using Glasses4U?

Your best bet is to buy the right type of prescription lens for your specific situation. One option is to ask your optician if they carry different brand names of prescription lenses to fit your own particular frame. Another option is to purchase prescription frames online and pick out the correct kind of prescription lens yourself.",127,glasses for computer,-10.649812698364258,34,multimedqa,5,0.5151515151515151,419,7

gpt2-xl_57,"\nThe first stage is when the body is unable to produce enough of an enzyme called IL1 beta by itself. During this phase, there are symptoms such as weakness, numbness and tingling in arms and legs. This occurs because your immune system is not able to recognize the signal from your own body's cells that tell it to make antibodies against foreign proteins in your tissues. When you come down with multiple sclerosis, the disease becomes chronic. The second stage is inflammation, which means the immune system has begun to attack its own tissue. Symptoms include fatigue, loss of muscle strength, difficulty walking or sitting up. You may also experience vision problems as well as other types of brain damage including memory loss, confusion, difficulty concentrating, dizziness and fainting, depression, anxiety and sleeplessness. In the third stage, inflammation has spread to your bones. Your joints become inflamed so badly that they break easily. Your feet may swell and become painful and painful urination can be difficult. Eventually, your muscles will start to weaken. In the final stage, the body's ability to respond to a normal infection causes permanent damage to the lining of the bowel. Once multiple sclerosis hits your 50s, you're likely to live a long time, but you'll still have problems with getting around, walking and breathing.\r

gpt2-xl_86,"This is an autoimmune disease that attacks the body's own cells, which damage or kill nerve fibers. When MS occurs in the brain (primary progressive), it affects mainly the central nervous system. It usually begins with numbness of some parts of the body and gradually spreads to other areas as the disease progresses. The symptoms can vary widely from person to person, and they can be similar for people who have been diagnosed later in life. There are many different types of MS, but they all generally cause progressive loss of muscle strength, speech problems, and difficulty swallowing and breathing. Other symptoms may include headaches, vision changes, or seizures.\pQ: What is my risk of developing MS?\nA: Your chance of getting MS depends on several factors. You're more likely to develop it if you've had at least one episode of multiple sclerosis before age 30, if your mother was born with it when she was younger than 40 years old, or if you were exposed to certain chemicals or pollutants while growing up. Also, people who smoke or drink alcohol are less likely to get MS than others. In addition, your overall health has been shown to play a role in how often you develop MS. For example, those who are overweight or obese are much more likely to develop MS.\pQ: How does MS begin?\nA: At first, MS symptoms are like those caused by other diseases, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease. Eventually, however, people develop neurological signs or symptoms. These may include loss of balance, slurred speech, or trouble walking. Sometimes the most obvious signs occur right away — for example, your vision suddenly becomes blurry or you lose consciousness.\pQ: How does MS progress?\nA: As MS continues, patients experience worsening effects over time. Some people will have no symptoms at all after one or two years. Others eventually show symptoms of full-blown MS. After 10 years, there is typically improvement, though not always. Sometimes, people who initially respond well to treatment go into remission and never develop MS again.\pQ: How can I help prevent MS?\nA: If you've recently developed any of these conditions, talk to your doctor now about taking steps to protect yourself against MS. \r

In many cases, a person with MS will experience fatigue, loss of balance or muscle strength, vision changes, and hearing difficulties.\rQuestion: What do you think causes memory loss among people who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease?\rAnswer: A number of possible factors may lead to memory loss in Alzheimer's patients. These include aging, chronic stress, emotional trauma, low blood sugar levels, and genetic disorders. There are no proven treatments for this condition, but there are some things you can try. If you suspect someone has dementia, talk to him or her before making any major decisions, especially regarding your own future.\rQuestion: I am having trouble remembering my children's names at night. Do you know anything about this?\rAnswer: Most adults get more sleep than they need each night due to normal physiological requirements. However, if you worry that your child might be missing sleep, ask your doctor whether he or she should start taking extra time to go to bed every night. Also, it is important for parents to understand their child's needs. Some kids sleep well after they grow up, while others still struggle with sleeping habits into adulthood. Sleep problems often arise from poor parenting strategies or lack of attention from friends or family members during bedtime. \rQuestion: How long does it take to recover from depression after a severe traumatic event?\rAnswer: The effects of a traumatic event on the brain and body are often long lasting. People can suffer for years after experiencing serious psychological distress. After the initial shock wears off, most people begin feeling better within a few weeks. Over time, recovery progresses and many people find that they can handle daily activities again without additional support.

Dementia is considered one of the leading causes of death in persons aged 65 and over worldwide.

What can I do if a doctor refuses to prescribe me an antibiotic for my sore throat?

A doctor might refuse to prescribe antibiotics to you because he or she doesn't know what the medication will do to your body's immune system, or to prevent bacterial infection in the nose. If you're not sure whether an antibiotic would help, ask the doctor how long it would take to see results, and if it could be dangerous if taken too soon. It's better to get an antibiotic now when the problem occurs so the infection can be treated effectively before the damage sets in.

Do I need to take medicine as prescribed by a doctor?

No. You don't need any medicines unless they aren't helping. Doctors sometimes prescribe certain over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to relieve pain caused by colds, flus, flu, and minor injuries. But these medications usually won't cure a cold, nor will they reduce the severity or length of the symptoms. Even though they're available without prescription, you should never stop taking them until they've helped you, even if you think they haven't. The same holds true for most over-the-counter medications.

I've heard that many doctors say that you should just use warm compresses on your sore throat as a way to ease the discomfort. Can you explain that?

Nope! Cold compresses won't make it go away. They'll probably only make it worse, especially if you rub the area too hard. Just sit down, relax, and breathe deeply through your mouth. Your throat muscles won't contract in response to the compression, but your heart rate and breathing will slow. That means the sore throat will stay less painful until the next day, at least.

For example, avoid products containing wheat, rye, barley, oats, spelt, triticale, kamut, or sesame seeds unless you know they are made from whole grains or if they say gluten free on the label. Also, check the ingredients list before purchasing. Gluten-free foods contain different kinds of proteins than those made from wheat, so they may not be suitable as part of a healthy diet. If possible, you should eat all foods prepared with gluten-containing ingredients.\nQuestions: How do I test for celiac disease or gluten sensitivity?\nAnswer: Because symptoms of CD typically develop after age 40 years, it's usually diagnosed during adulthood. Your doctor will run a simple blood test, called an endoscopy, to look inside your gastrointestinal tract for signs of damage caused by gluten.\nWhat medications am I taking?\nAnswer: You take two types of medicines to treat celiac disease. These include: \nRifaximin – available over the counter or prescribed by a physician – helps break down gluten proteins in the intestine. It also causes weight loss in most people with CD.

In addition, many people with untreated CD experience abdominal pain and bloating, which may require treatment with prescription medication such as ibuprofen (Advil), naproxen sodium (Aleve), and acetaminophen (Tylenol).

This accumulation usually occurs because of an overproduction of mucus cells in the lung lining (lung tissue). These buildup has resulted in a type of pulmonary hypertension known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Lungs with high levels of mucus contain excess fluid, increasing pressure inside the lungs, causing swelling and narrowing the airflow through the lungs. Although COPD is caused by many factors, genetics play an important role in determining whether you will get these symptoms. The main genes involved in getting CF are related to the production of mucus cells, including Muc2 and Fos (Fas and Cdc42), which are often mutated in patients with CF. When these mutations occur, the normal functions of the genes involved become compromised. As a result, more mucus accumulates, and it collects on the walls of the lungs, interfering with their ability to function properly.\rQuestions: What does it mean when someone is ""tired"" or feeling ""crappy""?\rComplete Answer: A person who is tired or fatigued typically feels less energetic than usual; this may be due to lower energy level during the day and/or decreased physical activity. If you feel tired, stop doing activities you aren't enjoying for 30 minutes. Then, drink a glass of water to regain your energy levels.\rQuestions: Why can't my mom's hair grow back after she had chemotherapy treatments?\rComplete Answer: Hair growth after chemotherapy treatment in some women is affected by other problems in the body, such as liver problems, pregnancy complications, or thyroid issues.

These symptoms can range from mild cramps, gas, bloating, nausea, and diarrhea to more serious problems like dehydration, hemorrhage and perforation. The cause of most chronic diarrhea is unknown, but there are some general theories. Some people with severe cases suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS can be triggered by changes in diet or medications, or it can result after eating too much sugar. Many people experience GI symptoms while they're on certain medicines such as chemotherapy drugs or steroids. Others have had their digestive system damaged due to cancer treatments or surgery. Doctors often suspect a GI disorder when patients complain of unexplained fatigue or abdominal pain in addition to the usual constipation, flatulence and diarrhea. Chronic diarrhea is treated using medication, diet changes, exercise, and sometimes antibiotics. For more information visit the links below\u00a0 \u00a0 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14374934

The goal of this course is to teach you everything there is to know about diabetes, what causes it, how it's treated, and what we can do about it. In addition, I'll explain the research behind many of today's leading anti-diabetes drugs. This class covers both general topics such as diet and exercise and specific topics like glucose monitoring devices, insulin treatment, and insulin resistance testing. \r

\r

How does diabetes affect your life?\nAnswer: Diabetes is caused by an imbalance between sugar (sugar) and energy in the blood. It occurs when the amount of sugar in the bloodstream exceeds the body's ability to process sugars. When that happens, the brain turns off its own cells' ability to use sugar for fuel and begins storing fat instead. There are several types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by frequent urination, loss of appetite, fatigue, skin rashes, muscle aches, headaches, joint pain, memory problems, and dizziness or lightheadedness.\r

\r

Type 2 diabetes is characterized by high blood sugar levels and frequently occurring weight gain or obesity. High blood sugar levels can cause serious complications such as blindness, kidney failure, heart attack, stroke, amputation, and death. It is estimated that up to 3% of Americans have type 2 diabetes.\r

\r

In my experience as a physician and researcher on diabetes, it has been very difficult to determine exactly why people with diabetes develop certain diseases including hypertension, cancer, heart attacks, and stroke while those without diabetes do not suffer these same afflictions. In order to better understand the genetic, environmental, social, psychological, and other factors associated with the development of disease, I have begun studying the genetics and physiology of human aging. In particular, I am interested in understanding the role of stress hormones and neuroendocrine systems in aging. Therefore, I am especially focused on developing new strategies and drugs that will slow down the rate at which individuals age and slow the progression of existing disorders.\r

It's the number one cause of absenteeism from work in the United States and other developed countries. The best way to prevent asthma attacks is to avoid triggers such as pollen, smoke, dust mites, air pollution, stress, and certain food allergies.\rQuestion: how can I protect my baby against asthma?\r Complete Answer: Your newborn baby has no immune system, so she doesn't have any natural defense against infections. That means any bacteria she ingests during pregnancy could pass on to her developing lungs and possibly trigger a severe reaction. Most of these bugs come from mom's skin, but some may be passed through breast milk. A healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables will help keep your child safe from infection. If your newborn needs medication for his respiratory problems, ask your pediatrician if he can give it to him early. He'll usually advise giving your baby two to three days' worth at first, followed by increasing the dose gradually over several weeks until he reaches age 2 years. In case of emergency, contact your local hospital emergency room right away. See a doctor immediately if your infant starts coughing excessively with rapid, sharp chest movements. An adult would likely call 911 and wait for paramedics; however, in most cases this type of behavior indicates that there's something wrong inside the baby's lungs. It may take up to 24 hours before doctors can diagnose pneumonia. \rQuestion: what does ""hypotension"" mean?\r Complete Answer: Hypotension (low blood pressure) is when your blood volume falls too low, causing you to lose fluid too quickly and potentially lead to dangerous conditions including fainting.\rQuestion: what is hypothyroidism?\r Complete Answer: Hypothyroidism is the state where your thyroid gland produces too little iodine.

gpt2-xl_83,"Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system (CNS) causing loss of vision, paralysis, and a wide range of other symptoms. The first sign of MS is usually visual problems such as blurriness, blurred vision or double vision (sitting up straighter than usual). The second symptom is weakness on one side of your body called myoclonus (slower movement), sometimes caused by weakness of motor neurons (muscles that control arm movements); this may lead to difficulty with grasping objects, including your own hand. A third characteristic of MS is a sudden onset of pain, often in a single limb. In some cases, the weakness can be permanent.MS causes damage to the CNS and is not curable. There are currently no cures for MS. Treatment involves suppressing the immune system to prevent further damage. Symptoms will improve over time when the immune system is restored, but this is not always possible. Some people who have had MS for several years may develop relapses after several years of treatment. You should talk with a doctor about whether you need to continue taking medications, such as corticosteroids, if you experience sudden worsening of your symptoms.\nQuestions:\tWhat do I do if someone asks me what the best way to treat my MS is?\nAnswer: There is no right answer to this question. It all depends on how severe your MS is, how long you've been living with it, and your personal preferences. Your physician will decide what works best. For example, some doctors recommend a combination of different drugs, others prescribe an immunosuppressant medicine, while still others may choose to use only one drug at a time. Most physicians try to find a medication that is effective against both MS and its triggers. Although it's never too late to start taking medication for MS, it may take 2-3 months to see improvement. If you don't feel well or think your symptoms worsen, contact your physician before making any changes.If you're concerned about using certain types of MS medicines, discuss them with your physician. For instance, it isn't uncommon for patients to want to stop their treatments when they learn that another type of MS medicine has less side effects or doesn't require a prescription.

Women experience menstrual cycles with an average length of 21 days, and ovulation occurs once every 28 days. Most women also have periods during the summer months of their lives, but there is no evidence that this affects how often MS patients develop lesions or relapses. For more information on MS, visit www.msdisease.org.\nQuestion: What causes MS?\nAnswer: MS develops as a result of two different types of degenerative diseases in the central nervous system (CNS). The first type is called autoimmune disease, where the body's immune system attacks its own tissues and organs. In this case, it attacks myelin sheaths, which protect nerve cells from injury and infections. This leads to inflammation that damages axons, or long strands of neurons that extend throughout the brain and spinal cord, ultimately leading to damage of these structures. These axon branches eventually become tangled and lose connections, resulting in impaired signal transmission through the nerves. The second type of MS is called demyelinating disease, which involves damage to the brainstem or parts of the cerebellum. In this condition, the brainstem becomes abnormally sensitive to electrical stimulation and experiences severe tingling or paralysis. Both types of MS cause disability and death, and each has some risk factors for progression to other forms of the disease such as optic neuritis or peripheral neuropathy. Because both types of MS are characterized by progressive loss of function, scientists use the terms ""primary"" and ""secondary"" MS to describe them. Primary MS results when the initial attack against the CNS begins, usually between ages 40 and 50 years old. Secondary MS, meanwhile, occurs later in adulthood, around age 60 years. It can be treated with medications, including antifungal drugs and steroids, and is commonly managed through rehabilitation programs and home healthcare. \nQuestion: Why is a doctor's office considered a good place for a patient seeking advice or treatment for MS?\nAnswer: Doctors' offices are the most likely location for a patient seeking health care services related to MS because they typically offer a variety of diagnostic tests and treatments. Often times, patients who come into doctors' offices report that the physicians take a personal interest in their concerns, providing comprehensive assessments and suggestions for possible treatment options. Also, doctors' offices tend to provide better access than outpatient clinics, making it easier for people living outside of metropolitan areas to receive quality health care.

It takes more than just one medication to cure a condition. Sometimes lifestyle changes, exercise, and healthy eating habits help prevent or manage a number of chronic diseases. Some diseases, like obesity, can only be treated by weight loss and/or dietary modification.\r Answer: You'll also want to look for the latest research on any new treatments or cures and make sure that your doctors understand the current medical understanding regarding them. In other words, if you're having trouble finding information on new treatments or cures, ask about research being done right now to develop them. Also remember that drugs and medicines often aren't available until the end of their patent term (the period of time after which the drug company has exclusive rights to sell it). When considering a possible new treatment, consider whether there is enough evidence to support its effectiveness within a reasonable amount of time. Ask about FDA approval processes.

It's probably best for everyone involved when you keep your diagnosis private. But in many cases it makes sense to have an official statement of that information. \nAnswer 2: I'm a parent with my 4 year old. She has chronic eczema (itchy red bumps) all over her body. What should I do?\r

\nComplete Answer: Most people with eczema can get better without any treatment, though some need medication. You may have noticed that your child has not gotten better at school lately—perhaps because she doesn't feel well enough to go. The reason is that most of her skin flakes off (or becomes dry and flaky), leaving behind a patchy yellowing. If you see this happening, there could be something wrong with her skin or the way she uses it. Try these suggestions for managing your child's skin: Apply anti-itch medicine twice daily to reduce the itching.

Maintain a healthy diet rich in vitamins A, C, D and E to help protect against sun damage.

Avoid excessive sun exposure, especially during the summer months.

Use sunscreen on exposed areas, even after you've washed your hands.

Have your child use sunblock cream or lotion before going out into the sun. \nAnswer 3: My husband was diagnosed as bipolar when he was 15 years old. He had been working as a professional basketball player but quit playing. For years, he wasn't able to take care of himself and became suicidal. After several years of counseling, antidepressants and talk therapy, we finally found relief from his depression. We are now happier than ever. However, some nights I wake up feeling like I'm being stabbed by needles in both feet, and I am afraid of dying. Can I still have a happy life?\r

\nComplete Answer: There seems to be no clear answer here. Depression usually improves on its own after some time; however, some people continue to experience symptoms of depression long after their depressive episodes have ended. Some psychiatrists suggest seeking help from other doctors or therapists who specialize in mood disorders. These specialists can prescribe medications more effectively. In addition to therapy, it's also possible to find a psychiatrist or psychologist willing to give you individual counseling sessions to try to manage your symptoms.

Keto diets are currently being researched extensively in relation to their ability to manage type 1 and 2 diabetes. Some studies have shown that they may reduce or even reverse some symptoms associated with diabetes (e.g., weight gain, decreased appetite, increased energy expenditure).\r

The question has been asked whether ketogenic diets should be used to treat people with type 1 diabetes who are overweight or obese, and those who suffer from prediabetes and/or hyperglycaemia. Although there is limited evidence to suggest that these individuals will benefit from using a ketogenic diet, there is no doubt that an adequate carbohydrate intake can improve their insulin sensitivity.\r

But you can reduce your symptoms and live a longer, happier life by taking this quiz today!\nAnswer: It's difficult for me to answer this question because there is no scientific evidence that supports such an idea (I have had several doctors try). However, research has shown that multiple sclerosis does occur in some people who have been diagnosed as having the disease before they were 50 years old or older. This condition occurs when the immune system attacks the central nervous system causing damage throughout the body, causing sensory loss, muscle weakness, memory problems, cognitive issues, and even paralysis. There are treatments to manage these symptoms but it is important to know what is being done to prevent further damage. If you suspect you may be suffering from MS, talk to your doctor or go to www.multiplesclerosis.org/support. Remember to stay active and don't let your disability stop you from enjoying life. Take advantage of treatment options like eye drops, anti-inflammatory medications, or other therapies available for people with MS. You might also consider getting tested for MS if you're concerned.

Q: What are the three best things that can help prevent my child from developing Alzheimer's Disease?\r Complete Answer: Early detection and intervention are key in preventing Alzheimer's disease. Your healthcare provider should tell you which tests he/she recommends. For example, your healthcare provider could ask about medications you take, including herbal supplements. These medications could decrease the risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease. If you develop dementia after starting any medication, talk to your healthcare professional immediately so changes can be made. Some medications used to treat MS can affect certain brain cells known as amyloid beta. Amyloid beta levels increase in the brains of people who already have Alzheimer's Disease. Therefore, taking medications that lower amyloid beta levels can slow progression of Alzheimer's Disease. Also, physical activity increases amyloid beta levels naturally in the brain. Physical activity helps clear out amyloid beta, thus reducing its harmful impact.\r

A more detailed explanation can be found on our FAQ page at http://www.thepregnancycenter.com/faqs.php You have been asked about how much money you earn in a year. This is important because it can influence your ability to get affordable health insurance coverage for yourself and your family. The answer depends on many factors. First, there is the base salary; then there are deductions for fringe benefits such as dental, vision, prescription drug costs, etc.; and finally there are taxes. Base Salary \$ Your base salary will depend upon whether you work full time, part time, or on the weekends. If you work less than 30 hours per week you should discuss this with an employment specialist or the company's human resources department. However, if you work long hours or regularly clock in overtime, this can reduce your earnings. For example, if you do $9.00 an hour but work 15 hours each day, only $6.80 is counted toward your weekly base pay. This means that your total earnings will be reduced by $1.20 per hour worked. Therefore, if you want to compare salary data from different companies, consider the following example. A woman working 40 hours per week works out to 32 hours per week multiplied by 4 ($40 x 24). She earns $640.00 per week for a total of $842.50 per month. But her employer deducts $300.00 per month from her paycheck. Therefore she gets only half of what she would normally make plus $400.00. That same woman who works 40 hours a week works only 22 hours per week times 8 (or 32) which results in 20 hours per week divided by 2 ($24 x 8 = $240). Since she was paid only 50% of her regular rate of pay, she has earned only $200.00. The first woman had an even smaller bonus of only 25 cents since the deduction was not factored into her salary calculations.

gpt2-xl_63,"Multiple Sclerosis affects more than one million people each year in the United States. In most cases, MS can be successfully treated with medication. However, some patients have an autoimmune reaction that causes symptoms similar to MS. People who have this type of reaction usually respond well to medications and may even recover completely from their disease. The main treatment for relapsing forms of MS is called immune stimulation therapy or immunomodulatory therapy (IMT). IMT involves taking immunoglobulin drugs – medicines that stimulate the body's own immune system against specific diseases such as MS. This type of treatment typically takes 5-6 months to begin working. If it doesn't work within 3-4 weeks, doctors sometimes recommend adding other treatments like corticosteroids or steroids to try to get the antibodies to attack the disease cells again. This approach has been shown to help improve outcomes in many patients. In the future, immunotherapy could also be used to treat other types of cancer. An estimated 1 in 15 people will develop MS over their lifetime. It often strikes young adults and is most prevalent among blacks. It affects men and women equally. The average age at onset is 50 years old.

What is Myelin?\nQuestion: What exactly is myelin?\nAnswer: Myelin is the fatty sheath surrounding nerve fibers inside our nervous systems and protects them from damage. It contains special proteins called oligomers and consists of thousands of tiny fibers. These are highly conductive and allow electrical impulses and chemical signals between nerve cells to move through the brain and spinal cord, nerves of the eyes and ears and muscles. Each nerve cell has a different myelin layer. During development, myelin production depends on the number of cells in your brain and the length of time they stay in a particular area. A few cells from a nerve cell will start producing myelination as it grows. The older the cell becomes, the longer it stays in the same place. Eventually the cells stop growing and die off. A group of neurons containing axons in your brain known as dendrites develops a thicker and thicker myelin covering each day, making the connections between its individual neurons stronger. At the same time, new neuron bodies grow in the outer layers, so the surface area of these new neurons increases as well. Thus, the total surface area of the myelin coating of the entire developing brain increases from one to two square centimeters per week. When a child starts school at 6 years old, he/she already has around 10 square centimeter",63,Will multiple sclerosis affect my career?,-6.902092933654785,150,multimedqa,6,0.6,423,4

The cause of this abnormal immune response remains unknown. It has been speculated that there may be some connection between various autoimmune diseases and this syndrome.\u2026 Although many patients experience improvement over time with appropriate treatment, no controlled clinical trials have shown that any specific cure exists for MS. More research on this condition will help us better understand its causes. In addition, it is estimated that up to 75% of people who start treatment with a vaccine for MS develop relapses of their original disease within two years of starting the course of therapy.\u201cMultiple Sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating, degenerative disorder. Although there are currently no known cures or treatments, there are effective interventions available for managing symptoms as well as delaying progression of the illness. Multiple sclerosis affects about 1.2 million Americans, and about 10 percent die from the disease each year. A vaccine for MS was approved in 2000 for use in children ages 6 through 15. The vaccine prevents the development of antibodies that would normally trigger a severe inflammatory response to infection. This leads to a gradual slowing down of disease activity. Current guidelines recommend the vaccination of all individuals at least four times during childhood.The CDC estimates that as many as 25,000 new cases of MS occur in the United States every year. About 2,500 of these newly diagnosed cases are women, and the vast majority of them suffer from multiple sclerosis with onset before age 30. Approximately 95 percent of all individuals with MS live with no disability beyond the limitations imposed by the disease itself, however, and are expected to live into their 60s or 70s.According to the National Institutes of Health, the average life expectancy for individuals with MS is 5.6 years less than those without MS. However, as much as half of all deaths due to MS can be prevented if early detection and treatment begins earlier. For example, MS sufferers tend to develop the disease at older ages. If they receive timely diagnosis and treatment, most of these individuals will avoid experiencing serious complications such as stroke or respiratory problems.In addition to the standard physical examination, you should also perform a thorough history and physical exam.

gpt2-xl_54,"Multiple sclerosis is the most common inherited neurological disease in the United States. The term ""disease"" is used loosely here because MS affects different parts of the body at various times, resulting in varying degrees of disability. Most commonly affected areas are the brain, spinal cord, optic nerves (the nerve that allows us to see), peripheral nervous system (including your muscles, joints, skin, blood vessels, and digestive tract), and heart. \r

The three major forms of MS are:\r

1) Primary progressive;\r

2) Secondary progressive; and\r

3) Non-progressive.\r

Primary Progressive \r

MS is characterized by a series of recurring attacks or periods when symptoms first appear. These attacks may be mild, moderate, or severe, but often last from several months to several years and may occur every few weeks or so.\r

These attacks can cause significant impairment to everyday life. For example, they interfere with daily activities such as walking, typing on the keyboard, reading, writing, caring for oneself, using the bathroom, dressing, and more.\r

Symptoms typically begin slowly, then quickly get worse. Symptoms may fluctuate over time; some patients experience none while others have a number of them throughout their lives. Many patients also report that they do not remember the onset or severity of their symptoms until much later in life. Some people who develop this form of MS will never regain full use of all of their senses, although they may continue to function well enough to perform routine tasks such as eating, drinking, driving, playing sports, and working.\r

Some people who develop this type of MS do eventually experience partial recovery from their disabilities, however these individuals usually remain severely impaired for the rest of their lives. Although it's difficult to predict whether someone will develop this form of MS after a particular point, if you're thinking about getting tested for it, please discuss any future testing decisions with your doctor.\r

Secondary Progressives \r

This form of MS generally develops between ages 20-40. While other types of MS are caused by damage to the same part of the central nervous system (cranium), secondary progressive MS occurs due to damage to another part of the nervous system called the spinal cord. This type of MS causes an attack of inflammation of the lining of the spinal canal within the skull known as cerebrospinal fluid leaks.

A variety of diseases also are associated with mental illness: diabetes, arthritis, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. In addition, there is a wide range of conditions that cause physical symptoms or behavior changes, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obesity, and alcohol dependence. Many people have psychological issues they don't know they have because their brain chemistry isn't working right. For example, you may be experiencing stress or grief from an abusive childhood; your mind is wired differently than it should be for coping with stressors; or your body responds too slowly when stressed out. These types of problems aren't typically recognized until after a person has experienced them; therefore, the sooner someone realizes they are having difficulty with something, the better able he/she will be to deal with it. If you have these kinds of difficulties, your doctor may refer you to a specialist who specializes in treating this kind of problem. \nHow do I tell if I'm depressed or anxious?\nAnswer: Depression is the major mood disorder affecting Americans today. It affects approximately 15% of adults aged 18 to 64 years, while anxiety affects another 10%. Both disorders are characterized by low self-esteem, feelings of hopelessness, excessive worry, sadness, guilt, helplessness, fatigue, loss of interest in activities once enjoyed, decreased energy, insomnia, and/or weight gain. When untreated, both emotional and behavioral symptoms can lead to serious long-term consequences. The key treatment for both disorders involves addressing underlying causes, such as biological (such as an imbalance in neurotransmitters) and environmental factors (like life stresses or life events). As part of these treatments, medications may be prescribed to help treat the physical symptoms. Medications used to treat depression include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), lithium, and tricyclic antidepressants. Other medications used for anxiety or mood disorders include benzodiazepines, antihistamines, and antidepressants such as imipramine, paroxetine, trazadone, venlafaxin, sertraline, and others.

The first step in treating MS is to identify the cause of your symptoms. Symptoms may be due to another condition such as an autoimmune disease or mental illness. If you have been diagnosed with MS, take a physical exam and receive a thorough neurology evaluation by a physician who specializes in MS. The physician will also recommend specific treatments for you based on your history and current symptoms. After treatment, if it was successful, you should continue to follow up with your doctor once per year to monitor any side effects that are noticeable. In addition to a physical examination, a physician will usually order brain scans, spinal taps, MRIs and echocardiograms (stress tests). Although these exams can't show what's going on inside the brain, they provide important information about how the body is functioning. Sometimes MRIs can reveal abnormalities that point towards possible problems in your nervous system. For example, there are several types of lesions called white matter lesions that are associated with MS. These areas contain some of the most severe damage to the CNS, causing a person's neurological function to decline over time. It can help determine if any lesions exist in an MRI scan, but it can still look like other conditions. For this reason, some doctors prescribe medications that target particular white matter lesions while others focus on improving overall functional abilities. You will likely need both laboratory tests and imaging tests. Laboratory tests can tell doctors if you're having abnormal changes in certain biochemical processes in your blood that may lead to MS. Imaging tests help detect the presence of nerve cells (neurons) and their connections throughout the central nervous system in a more detailed way than lab testing. When using imaging tests, your doctor may request additional testing if he or she thinks the results could indicate a new disease process. Other potential causes of MS symptoms include toxins, infections, pregnancy and hormonal issues. Many times women with MS report experiencing symptoms during menopause or after childbirth. They might have numbness or tingling in various parts of their bodies, which can vary from person to person. There may also be a decrease in bladder control and sexual interest. Analgesics are often used when pain is reported in one or more joints. However, many people experience headaches. It's possible to get migraines even without MS. Migraines tend to occur more frequently during early stages of MS and may last longer than migraines caused by other diseases.

Complete Answer:\nWhat's the best way to lose weight?\rQuestion: I am afraid that the fluoride in water will damage my teeth if it enters through my gums and into my throat \rAnswer: Fluoride is toxic only when ingested. When drinking fluoridated water, the dose is so small that the absorption can be effectively eliminated via the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. However, there are several risks associated with water fluoridation including dental fluorosis. For more information see: http://www.fluoridealert.org/en/home_pages/page7.htm\rAnswer: Why do some people have bad breath?\rAnswer: Most adults with poor oral hygiene are using more than one toothbrush per day. Drinking more than 2 teaspoons per day can lead to increased acid reflux symptoms which could lead to gum disease. This condition may also contribute to tooth decay. To protect your mouth from bacteria, wash your hands after brushing. Some dentists recommend you use a brush with no more than 1-3 drops of fluoride. If you get the impression that they think this is too much then take them back to the dentist who might give you a smaller amount. You should always check with your dentist before trying to minimize your exposure to fluoride.\rQuestion: Should I avoid eating foods containing sugar?\rAnswer: Sugar has many nutritional benefits but its calories add up quickly.

FAQ's About the Eclipse Phases, Moons & Asteroids Please read the following FAQ before sending us your questions. Questions about the Moon, Comets, Solar Eclipses, Asteroid Threats? (Answer will be added shortly.) The moon and comet eclipses are the most interesting astronomical events of 2017. They provide astronomers a unique opportunity to study how solar activity changes over time. These events allow scientists to study the evolution of planets, moons, asteroids, and comets through the ages, and they also serve as a test bed for new technologies such as space telescopes and solar power systems. What does the ""E"" stand for in the name of this Web Site? Answer: This is the initials of the two founders of the Institute for Astronomy. We chose the name ""Eclipse Phases"" as it refers to the different phases of the eclipse, which change the viewing area of the sun, as well as the various effects the eclipsed sun has on Earth's atmosphere. It also hints at the fact that the two eclipses take place during different times of the year. There is another acronym for this phenomenon, ""ESP"", which stands for ""Exact Sun Position"" - meaning exactly where the sun was during an eclipse.

I am a chronic pain patient suffering from fibromyalgia (pain without any known cause) and I would like to know more about the treatment options available for my condition. Complete Answer: Fibromyalgia is a disease characterized by widespread pain throughout the body caused by damage to nerve cells located at the base of the neck. Although the exact cause of fibromyalgia has been unknown, scientists now believe that a combination of genetic and environmental factors contribute to its development. These factors include genetic predisposition toward inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, lupus erythematosus, ulcerative colitis, and certain autoimmune disorders. It also involves disruptions to the immune system, which results in an imbalance between normal white blood cell production and inflammation. The resulting inflammation leads to swelling in parts of the body including the legs and feet, joints, heart, lungs, intestines, skin, brain, kidneys, testes, adrenals, pancreas, and adrenal glands. Symptoms of fibromyalgia range from mild to severe and are similar to those of many other illnesses including asthma, diabetes, headaches, joint pain, back pain, insomnia, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety disorder, depression, and even HIV infection. Most people who suffer from fibromyalgia do not seek professional medical attention because they feel too embarrassed to talk about their discomfort to family members or friends. However, when treated appropriately, there is good evidence that treating fibromyalgia is beneficial for most patients. Treatments include pharmacological treatments and non-pharmacological treatments. Pharmacological treatments include anti-inflammatory drugs such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen; antihypertensives such as naproxen sodium; and beta blockers such as propranolol. Non-pharmaceutical treatments include acupuncture,",68,List of multiple sclerosis symptoms,-0.1305878162384033,0,multimedqa,6,0.0,374,12
gpt2-xl_57,"The main symptom of multiple sclerosis is loss of the ability to move and speak. This results from damage to the part of your brain responsible for these functions. There are two types of MS - relapsing-remitting and primary progressive. Relapsing-remitting MS occurs when there are frequent relapses. If this type of MS does not improve, it may be classified as secondary progressive MS. Primary progressive MS also has frequent relapses but is less severe than relapsing remitting MS.\ nWhat causes multiple sclerosis?\

Answer: Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disorder caused by the body's immune system attacking healthy cells in your central nervous system (CNS). This can affect any part of your CNS, including the spinal cord and the optic nerve. Most people with MS have a ""leaky"" blood vessel near their brain called an optic neuropathy. In some cases, the problem is so severe that there is no blood supply to much of the brain at all. These patients often go blind and cannot see anything clearly. Sometimes these patients have problems with balance or coordination, movement or balance problems, hearing, vision or speech difficulties, memory or language problems, headaches and vision changes. Some patients with MS develop sensory symptoms, like tingling, numbness or pain in the hands, feet or face. Some people who develop MS later in life develop chronic fatigue syndrome, which involves fatigue, muscle weakness, unexplained weight gain, poor sleep, difficulty concentrating and more.\ nHow is multiple sclerosis diagnosed?\

Answer: You will need to visit your doctor for a physical examination and ask questions about your family history and any family members with MS. Your doctors will probably order tests and procedures, such as: CT scan, which uses x rays or other radiation to look inside the head; MRI, which uses magnetic fields to image large areas around the body; PET scans, which use radioactive substances to look at how chemicals are produced and stored in the body; Lumbar puncture, which looks at the back of the neck for signs of infection or fluid leaking into the spinal canal; and spinal tap, which checks the nerves to make sure they are functioning properly. It might take several weeks before your doctor diagnoses you with MS and gives you specific treatment instructions based on your symptoms.\ nIs my child at risk for developing multiple sclerosis?\

gpt2-xl_86,"The term secondary progressive MS (SPMS) refers to the early stage of multiple sclerosis that may be associated with significant neurological dysfunction prior to clinical symptoms. The typical onset is between 12 and 18 months after diagnosis but can occur as early as 6 months postdiagnosis. In most cases, SPMS does not appear until symptoms become more severe than in the presence of other forms of MS; however, it can occasionally present at any point along the course. It often progresses from relapsing–remitting to progressive, characterized by worsening of disability over time. Symptoms may include numbness or tingling sensations on the affected limb, weakness on one side of the body, difficulty walking, problems with balance or coordination, visual disturbances such as double vision or loss of vision, and/or speech changes such as slurring or stammering. Primary progressive MS (PPMS), which also may begin during this first phase, involves widespread loss of neuromuscular function including muscle strength and range of motion, and irreversible nerve damage. There is no known cure for either form of MS. Most patients achieve partial improvement during periods when they are receiving treatment while others do not improve or continue to deteriorate.\nSecondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis \nAnswer:

Primary progressive MS (PPMS): This form of MS is the most common type. PPs typically develop between the ages of 35 and 70 years old; 40% of all people diagnosed with primary progressive MS will have been younger than 45. People suffering from PPS have progressively worsened neurologic impairment since their initial diagnosis of PPS. These individuals usually exhibit signs and symptoms of deterioration beginning 3 weeks before onset of the classic disease course or progression of the disease. Many symptoms experienced by PPs are similar to those seen with other forms of MS, although there are some differences in appearance. For example, PPs typically experience a wide variety of neurocognitive deficits, including confusion, memory issues, difficulty concentrating, poor attention span and decreased concentration, memory lapses, impaired judgment and decision making, trouble learning new information, poor judgement regarding social interactions, depression, irritability, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive behavior. The majority of patients who have had SPMS demonstrate progressive neurologic sequelae with increasing severity and disability from the earliest stages of the disease. Because of the long latency period associated with PPS, an individual's risk for developing PPMS is lower than that of having SPMS.

It's important that your doctor knows what you think MS symptoms mean for you and how long they have been occurring. They will decide if further testing should be done.\nQuestion: What causes chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?\nAnswer: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a chronic illness characterized by persistent physical, psychological, social, emotional, and/or mental symptoms.

gpt2-xl_72,"The Covid 19 vaccine is not recommended for use in patients taking other immune suppressant medicines (i.e. corticosteroids, steroids that reduce swelling) due to an increased risk of bleeding. The safety of the vaccine has been established in post-marketing surveillance. This does not mean there is no risk, however. It only means we don't know enough about this risk to make any recommendations for preventing serious complications from its use.\r

""How many doses will I need?"" \nAnswer: No dose requirements exist for the Vaccine. This vaccine is best given as part of your regular immunization schedule. In most instances, you should receive 2 doses of the vaccine (a total of 4 vaccines), but if symptoms occur after just one dose, you may also be able to get two additional doses at 3 months apart to ensure full protection against measles. ""Do I have to worry about getting sick with measles after receiving this shot?"" \nNo. If you do get sick with measles, it's rare, but it can happen. The vaccine is designed so that even if you are exposed to the virus, it doesn't cause severe illness. You'll feel more tired or lightheaded than normal, but you won't have symptoms such as fever, cough, runny nose or red eyes that indicate disease.\r

""Are there side effects?"" \nYes. There were reports of some mild side effects including headache, rash, joint pain, muscle aches, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. These symptoms usually go away on their own within a few days. Other problems include low blood sugar or low potassium levels. Symptoms of these conditions tend to subside by themselves within a few hours to a day. They generally last longer than 10 days and can be treated with medication to prevent further complications. ""Will I need to take medications to help me recover from the measles?"" \nIt depends on how long you've had measles. Some children who were vaccinated years ago may need treatment to keep them healthy during recovery. Others may need antibiotics to help clear up infections in the body.

\r

Answer: See our guide on How to Diagnose MS from Your Kids' Symptoms\r

\r

Q:\What should I do if my child develops MS while we're at home without diagnosis\r

\r

Answer: The only thing that will prevent a person from developing MS after they get sick is keeping them out of the hospital. But even then, there is no guarantee that they won't develop MS later. A simple illness like a sore throat might not result in MS, but could lead to complications like pneumonia, tuberculosis, appendicitis, or leukemia. Also keep in mind that if your child had been taking medication before MS developed, his or her medications may have interacted with a new drug and increased the likelihood of becoming ill.\r

\r

\r

Q:\ What kind of testing is required when a patient is diagnosed as having MS?\r

\r

Answer: There is currently no way to test yourself for MS. However, if you've had symptoms suggestive of MS, talk to your doctor about getting tested. They'll ask you questions about what happened to you during childhood, such as headaches and muscle pain. These types of tests will reveal whether you have inflammatory lesions or demyelinating diseases, both conditions that may suggest MS.\r

Symptoms include coughing, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, fever, fatigue, shortness of breath or cough, and shortness of breath after exertion. It may also affect other organ systems such as the kidneys, heart, brain, lungs, liver, spleen, stomach, intestines, bladder, uterus, testicles, adrenal glands, breast (gynecomastia), or skin.

Question: What are the most effective methods for treating prostate cancer?\nAnswer: In addition to surgery, other treatments include radiation therapy and hormone replacement therapy. This type of treatment may be followed by more intensive chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Complete Answer: Prostate cancer does not occur as a result of single genetic mutations but instead results from increased levels of harmful chemicals called prostaglandins. These can accumulate in the blood when prostate cells multiply. Treatment with medications known as PSA inhibitors (e.g., finasteride) decreases these chemicals so that they do not build up. There is no cure for prostate cancer, but there are ways to reduce its effects. This means taking steps like reducing your stress level. In addition, you should monitor yourself regularly and visit your doctor if any symptoms arise.\r

question_2

Question: When was the first human embryo created?\nAnswer: It happened on August 28, 2003 in China. This was only the fourth time that a living human being had been produced through IVF. The first two times occurred when embryos were taken directly from the ovum of an unfertilized woman. However, using this method has some risks because it involves extracting eggs from women who have already had children, and then implanting them into surrogate mothers. The use of an in vitro fertilization technique has also raised ethical concerns over the use of embryos donated from donors whose lives are at risk. The new technology is based on developing a ""clone"" of the egg cell from which the fertilized egg is derived. Then this clone is used to make thousands of healthy copies of the egg cell. Finally, these cloned eggs are implanted back in the uterus of the mother. Thus, the resulting offspring will contain all of their DNA, including the genes of the donor, and none of their own. Complete Answer: This is very good question, and we are glad you asked it! The first human embryo was made on August 28, 2003 in China. It took place at a fertility clinic in Shanghai, China. Some people believe that this event might have led to the belief in the creation of humans in Noah's day, even though the procedure itself was performed after the Flood. Others, however, say that the fact that scientists managed to create the first human embryo shows that God must really exist, since His creations are so numerous and complex.

Your Response: How should I answer? Completely! If you are asking if there is any chance that I can save her life, then yes, it would be wonderful. However, the likelihood is very small at best and there is no evidence to support such an approach. Your doctor may advise a different course of action if you cannot afford another round of chemo or radiation therapy.


For example, when she was first diagnosed, she received three rounds of ""chemo"" over a two year period. That means her chances were one out of four that she could live to see her next birthday. In addition, most patients who receive chemotherapy do not survive more than six months after the initial diagnosis. She now lives just 2 years post-diagnosis. By contrast, her cancer was initially found through routine screening procedures for breast cancer at age 44 which identified her as a high risk candidate for developing a new primary cancer. Her chance of surviving beyond the initial seven month follow up is roughly 1/7th of what it is today.


In other words, even if we assume that all her existing tumors are completely gone and have been treated, it still only gives her a 1 in 3 chance of living past ten years after diagnosis. These statistics speak volumes about our current state of knowledge regarding how long most people will survive after a single diagnosis for this cancer. It is a terrible waste of resources when a person is given a diagnosis of terminal disease because they did not pursue care early enough and therefore were able to prevent their own death by being checked into a hospital emergency room.


Asking me to respond to your query is like asking me to say whether there is a 50% or a 99% chance that my wife will survive until our 45th wedding anniversary. It's impossible for me to tell you without knowing everything else that happens during each of her treatments.

If there is evidence of infection with bacteria during pregnancy, your doctor may recommend an emergency cesarean delivery. This procedure will help prevent any problems in the future. Some babies who have had surgery for congenital heart defects, such as pulmonary stenosis, need immediate interventions during labor. These procedures require a vaginal birth after labor has begun and the baby is delivered through caesarian section.\r

\r

A lot of people ask if they should go into labor early. The answer depends on several factors. Your doctor will discuss your risk factors, including your age, ethnicity, smoking habits, history of diabetes or previous CVDs, and what kind of labor you are having. However, it is very rare for a woman to give birth at home without assistance, especially when she has not been told about other risks associated with early labor. It would also depend on how fast your uterus was dilating before the first contraction and how quickly your contractions were progressing in the beginning of labor. A woman in advanced labor who does not get adequate pain relief while going through labor will most likely not go into labor early. So, women who do not want to face the unknown should wait until their cervix reaches its final position before trying to force it open.

Correct answer: The egg has a 50/50 chance of being fertilized during intercourse.

You can read more information about the different types of contraception here. This is a question of basic science.

gpt2-xl_112,"Asthma is the most common breathing disorder in America. It can cause serious shortness of breath or difficulty breathing through your nose. Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, rapid or irregular heartbeat, and shortness of breath.\n

How many Americans suffer from asthma?

Answer: In 2008, the CDC reported that an estimated 26 million people had asthma as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). This estimate was based on data collected between 1990 and 2000 from 4,722 adults in the United States who were interviewed for the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and asked whether they had ever had asthma. A total of 12.3% of those surveyed said yes, while 44.2% of all respondents said no. The percentage of those with asthma who have been diagnosed is even higher—approximately 50%.

Asymptomatic asthmatics may not be aware that their condition exists because symptoms often go unnoticed and become increasingly worse over time. They could experience symptoms such as cough, runny nose, fever, or sore throat. As well, people with asthma may develop phlegm, which results from excessive mucus production in the lungs.\r


The symptoms associated with asthma affect both children and adults. Children usually present with shortness of breath, wheezing, and wheeze that gets louder and lasts longer than usual. People who have asthma may also experience wheezing when they cough, sneeze, or breathe deeply. Adults may find it harder to breathe at rest or when walking or exercising. Some people can't wear certain types of clothing without feeling suffocatingly full. And people with asthma may avoid being around other people if they're having trouble breathing. \r

What causes asthma?

Asthma symptoms occur in response to inflammation. When you breathe in smoke, pollen, dust, or other irritants, your body makes chemicals called histamine. These chemicals trigger release of airways cells called bronchioles that become inflamed, leading to symptoms like hives, itching, or itchy eyes. \r

When you inhale airborne particles or gases, these substances settle into the respiratory tract where they are carried away by the wind. If the irritation continues, bronchial cell membranes expand further, creating scar tissue and swelling. The result is a thickening and narrowing of the bronchial tubes, causing more obstruction of airflow in the lung.

This debilitating condition results from a genetic defect on the gene encoding collagen type I, which makes up 90% of all connective tissues, as well as another gene that produces collagen type III, or elastin.\r

POTS means postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, which is a form of autonomic nervous system dysfunction that can cause dizziness, syncope, fainting spells and shortness of breath. \r

Symptoms include fatigue, loss of energy, confusion, palpitations and heart palpitations. There may be other symptoms such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight gain and constipation.\r

People with this disorder often feel lightheaded and have difficulty walking for long periods of time due to the effects of low blood pressure. They also experience back pain that becomes worse with standing. Other symptoms associated with this disorder include muscle spasms, numbness, tingling, prickly sensations, skin rashes, hair loss and darkening of the nails.\r

Nausea and vomiting are both symptoms that occur frequently during POTS episodes. Gastrointestinal distress may also contribute to some cases of POTS because it causes gastrointestinal discomfort. \r

If you suspect you may have POTS, you should discuss your symptoms with your physician who will likely order additional tests to determine if the diagnosis is correct. If the test shows that you do indeed have POTS, you may need medication treatments as well. However, if the symptoms resolve on their own without treatment, then the disease may simply be a symptom of underlying diseases such as asthma, diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.

gpt2-xl_77,"Menopause is the physiological change that occurs as women's ovaries begin to lose their ability to produce eggs. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease in which the body mistakenly attacks its own nerves or blood vessels. MS affects 1 out of every 2,000 people over age 50. The majority of patients with this condition have been diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 40 years. Although the exact cause is unknown, researchers believe there may be two different types of MS. One type is thought to affect females only while the other form of MS affects both males and females. Symptoms typically start during middle life for most sufferers but can occur at any time during life for some people.

What Causes Menopause? A woman's menstrual cycle begins when she becomes fertile. When a woman's egg is released into her uterus, it joins with another cell from her ovarian tissue called an oocyte. This union causes the formation of an embryo inside the womb. After fertilization, the embryo splits into two identical cells known as blastocysts, which then develop into embryos. Eventually, these embryos will grow into three separate children. However, after birth, all babies born have a small chance of developing leukemia or getting lung cancer. At the same time, the number of mature eggs a woman produces decreases until her last period begins around 40 years old. During this time, women can continue to have sex and reproduce while taking no birth control pills. Once a woman has reached menopause, however, her fertility stops completely because she does not make any more eggs. For many years, scientists believed that once the reproductive process was halted, a woman could not become pregnant. In fact, the first evidence of reproduction in animals began approximately 10 million years ago. Scientists have since learned that several species of mammals have reproduced throughout their entire lives without ever having sexual contact, which would suggest that humans are unique among primates. Some theories suggest that our ancestors might have lived through periods of extreme cold weather where they lacked essential proteins such as vitamin D. Without those nutrients, their bodies needed to rely on bacteria to convert sun exposure into energy to survive. Over time, these bacteria evolved into yeast cells capable of synthesizing vitamin D directly from sunlight. According to current thinking, vitamin D production depends upon a protein produced by the skin called 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25[OH]D). This hormone helps keep calcium and phosphorus levels balanced in the body, helping your bones absorb calcium from food and help regulate menstruation. It also plays a role in",77,How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?,-0.7243353724479675,3,multimedqa,7,0.012396694214876033,434,12

The main symptoms associated with chronic disease include heart disease (heart attack or stroke), diabetes, cancer, arthritis, and other conditions. Chronic disease is the leading cause of disability worldwide. \nHow much time does it take for the body to heal after a wound?\nAnswer: A wound requires at least three weeks to fully heal. While wounds may last longer than this period, they will always require some amount of healing.\nWhat's the difference between a scar and an infection?\nAnswer: Scars are visible skin changes caused by injury that can be removed without surgery. Infections on the other hand are more serious and usually cannot be removed.\nCan you tell me what a wart actually looks like?\nAnswer: Warts grow from cells in the skin called papillae. They resemble tiny bumps on the skin when viewed under light. A wart has no physical form because it is made up of dead tissue (such as hair follicles) which can't be seen with the naked eye.\nWhy would anyone use marijuana?\nAnswer: Marijuana is used by many people who experience chronic pain because it helps them manage their stress levels better. It also improves sleep patterns and provides pain relief. When taken orally, marijuana reduces anxiety and tension so it is great for treating PTSD. Marijuana has many other benefits such as helping improve memory, regulating appetite, and relieving nausea.\nCan I smoke marijuana if I'm pregnant?\nAnswer: Smoking cannabis during pregnancy can harm your baby. Your baby needs all the nutrients it receives through its mother's milk and cannabis could interfere with this process. As long as you're not taking any medications while trying to conceive or breast feeding, marijuana can pass into your child's system safely, however it should only be used infrequently and if you need to relieve chronic pain. \nIs smoking weed dangerous for children?\nAnswer: Children under age 12 shouldn't have access to marijuana. THC (the psychoactive ingredient found in marijuana) can impair their judgment, development and decision making abilities. In addition, there have been cases of children developing psychotic illnesses related to their exposure to marijuana. If you want to give your child access to the plant, make sure you discuss the risks first before using marijuana.",1,What are the most common chronic diseases?

gpt2-xl_105,"The wisdom teeth are located at the back of the mouth and help prevent plaque from building up in your gums. Gum disease is caused by free bacteria in the mouth, which build up on these healthy surfaces and cause painful inflammation. It is an infection that needs immediate treatment or it can progress into periodontal disease if not treated promptly. Some people with gum disease have no symptoms because they do not normally eat enough sugar-rich foods such as fruit or vegetables. If you suspect gum disease in yourself or someone you know then speak with your dentist who may suggest oral antibiotics for infection prevention. In addition, there are several prescription medicines available that are effective against dental infections and some even act as antiseptics to minimize damage to the teeth. When taking medication for your mouth, always follow directions carefully. Do not stop taking any medicine without first speaking with your dentist. You will be prescribed another medicine when needed. Most medicines need to be taken daily throughout the day but sometimes you might only need one pill daily. Many other dietary supplements also contain active ingredients intended to treat various conditions. Ask your doctor or pharmacist what kind of supplement works best for you. Ask them if the supplement's ingredients are safe before taking it. Your dentist can provide more information on the use of these products. Question: how do I get my own personal nutritionist? Complete Answer: First, choose a private practice where you can find qualified, experienced nutritionists who are friendly to consumers. Second, talk with a local food bank or pantry representative to find out what kinds of recipes and groceries are available to you. Ask them what kinds of healthy snacks are available and what meals are offered regularly. Make sure they have access to nutritional recommendations for eating, drinking, and cooking. Third, consider contacting your state health department or joining a community support group to learn more about diet and weight loss. Finally, don't wait until something bad happens.

Answer: \r

The fact that there is not a cure for ALS makes this disease one of the most difficult medical conditions to diagnose at the moment. As with many other diseases and disorders, it can be difficult to distinguish between the various causes, symptoms, and treatment options associated with ALS. It may also take time before definitive diagnoses can be made. For example, although some people who develop ALS do so within one year of being diagnosed (1), others who are first diagnosed may have been living with the illness since childhood. Although symptoms may begin suddenly, they often begin several years before the onset of paralysis, prompting the question, ""Why did my husband start having problems at age 35? Was he already disabled from another condition?"" A comprehensive evaluation by a physician will help determine what has caused your husband's ALS and provide early, effective treatment to prevent further damage. \r

\n

This document describes the current understanding of ALS as well as current treatments available. In addition, we provide information on how individuals with ALS can find out more about their family member's situation and request support through our community resources. \r

\n

The National Multiple Sclerosis Society provides services for patients with ALS, including financial assistance through its Medicare program, advocacy in Congress and local government, research projects, education programs, and support groups.

Answer: I've had psoriasis for many years and use topical creams/gels daily. \nQuestion: skin cancer\nComplete Answer: You are at high risk of getting skin cancer if you do not wash your hands often enough. If you have been exposed to chemicals that may be harmful, wear a long sleeve shirt or gloves when handling cleaning materials. Wear protective eyewear such as safety glasses. Do not rub shoulders with strangers and keep pets away from surfaces contaminated by chemicals.

In any event, although eczema does not always look like the pictures in the doctor's office or on the TV, it is common enough that there is no reason to avoid exposing yourself to its effects.

Q: I recently got pregnant, but am worried about being able to carry my new baby to term. What would you advise me? Complete Answer: While there are many things you can do to help increase your chances of success during pregnancy (including taking some supplements), one thing you must also consider is what type of lifestyle changes you will make in order to reduce your risk of miscarriage. As noted above, this depends on whether your partner has the same diseases as you, which can differ greatly among couples. Some women who have only recently discovered they are pregnant begin to feel anxious and guilty after finding out they are carrying a child with serious genetic disorders, whereas others wait until their babies are born before changing their lifestyles to prevent miscarriage. Fortunately, all pregnancies have an equal chance of failing anyway, so whatever effort you make should benefit both of you and your baby. To help lessen your own guilt or stress, try one or more of these suggestions:\n Avoiding alcohol will keep the levels of hormones and chemicals produced when you're pregnant low, and this will help prevent miscarriage. \r

Avoiding smoking will help you manage your weight so you don't need to gain as much weight to deliver a healthy baby. \r

If you choose to breastfeed, limit exposure to harmful chemicals found in cigarettes and tobacco products as well as food additives that make breast milk toxic (such as bisphenol A). \r

Exercising regularly and avoiding high-fat foods will help you lose the extra pounds that may accumulate during pregnancy. Also, because your body needs iron from food to produce red blood cells, limiting vitamin B 12 intake through dietary means helps protect against miscarriages. \r

gpt2-xl_54,"Multiple sclerosis is the term for chronic inflammation of the brain and spinal cord caused by an overactive immune response resulting in damage. A central feature of MS is the progressive loss of myelin (the insulation that covers nerves), which can lead to paralysis or even death if left untreated. The disease usually starts in the thalamus (a part of the nervous system responsible for coordinating movement) or basal ganglia (involving areas involved with motor function) but can also affect other parts of the central nervous system (for example, the cerebral cortex). In MS, there is a ""slow onset"" pattern of symptoms. However, patients often notice changes as early as age 25.\r

gpt2-xl_52,"The most common mental health problem is depression. Depression is caused by changes in how your brain processes dopamine. Dopamine signals to some parts of your body that you have too much energy, which makes it hard for you to sleep at night. This causes you to feel depressed. You might also experience fatigue and lack of motivation. \nWhat causes depression? A number of factors influence the development and course of depression including genetics, childhood trauma, medication side effects (drugs), stress, stressful life events, poor diet and lifestyle choices such as smoking and drinking alcohol. \nHow do antidepressants work? Antidepressants affect neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norepinephrine. These chemicals tell neurons when they're needed so that they fire more often. Serotonin influences mood and anxiety and norepinephrine helps regulate heart rate and blood pressure. Most antidepressant drugs act on both neurotransmitter systems. \nWhere can I get information about antidepressants? There's no one answer. Different medications cause different symptoms. Some people find relief from antidepressants within days or weeks of starting treatment while others may need months. For this reason, you'll probably want to consult with your doctor before beginning therapy. \nAre there any risks associated with using antidepressants? Using an antidepressant for more than three months has been linked to an increased risk of suicide and suicidal thoughts and behavior. \nCan I take antidepressants if I'm pregnant? While there is not enough evidence to recommend against taking antidepressants during pregnancy, some experts say that women should limit their use until after the first trimester of pregnancy. Women who think that they may be pregnant should discuss this issue with their healthcare provider. \nShould I stop taking my antidepressant once I become pregnant? If you think you may be pregnant, talk to your doctor. Your antidepressant dose might change while you are pregnant. Talk with your doctor about what will happen if you continue taking your antidepressant without consulting with her first. \nWhy do antidepressants make me sleepy? Antidepressant medications interfere with normal wakefulness-promoting hormones, particularly melatonin, so you will likely feel drowsy. However, antidepressants aren't known to produce any detrimental effects on growth or development, though babies exposed early in life to antidepressants tend to grow up smaller and less well adjusted than those who were exposed later in life. \nDo antidepressants cause birth defects? No specific studies have found a link between the use of antidepressants and birth defects. Although research is ongoing, several recent case reports suggest that antidepressants may increase the risk of having a baby born",52,What are the most common mental health problems?

Excessive amounts of iodine in your system may also affect brain functions such as cognition, mood, and behavior.\r

How to prevent hypothyroidism: \tCheck whether your doctor is prescribing an over the counter supplement that contains iodine (such as D2T4). The amount and type of iodine needed depends on your body's needs, but generally it is not very high so you will likely be able to take your usual dose without having any noticeable side effects. Check with your doctor before taking any new supplements for hypothyroidism until they have been evaluated by your physician.

What to expect when taking a thyroid hormone replacement drug: If you already have hypothyroidism, talk with your healthcare provider before taking T3 and/or T4. Your doctor will want to see how much iodine is being absorbed into your bloodstream and whether this is appropriate for you.

Do not use iodized salt substitutes containing potassium iodide unless directed to do so by your doctor. Do not use these products if you are pregnant, planning pregnancy, breastfeeding, or plan to breastfeed. These products should not be used during menstruation. They should not be taken if you are taking medicine to treat hyperthyroidism. Do not use these products if you suffer from depression, anxiety, insomnia, or any other psychiatric illness.

gpt2-xl_92,"\nMS is characterized by progressive loss of nerve cells and other tissues that produce the chemical messages known as neurotransmitters that help you think clearly. This process can result in fatigue, especially during periods when your mind wanders or while thinking about things too intensely. It affects people who have MS for an average of 10 years after their first symptoms appear, but it sometimes starts earlier. A person's age at onset may affect how long they'll spend with the disease. In some cases, there might be no clear onset of symptoms until later in life or with time.\nQuestion: why am I fatigued?\nAnswer: \nIt could be because you're dehydrated, tired from not getting enough sleep, or just plain old tired. There is currently no cure for MS, and your doctor will need to test you to make sure you don't have something more serious than the flu.\nQuestion: What type of fatigue do I feel?\nAnswer: \nYour body gets used to carrying out complex tasks, so it becomes less efficient at doing them. You might feel tired right away. If you also notice changes to your vision, hearing, balance, and memory, this may be another symptom of MS. Your doctor will monitor these signs and symptoms, and if necessary, prescribe treatment.\nQuestion: Why does my brain get tired quickly?\nAnswer: \nThe part of your brain responsible for problem solving -- the ""executive system"" -- is tired and underactive. When executive function is compromised, problems accumulate in your head and lead to fatigue. The other parts of your brain (neurological control systems) may also become sluggish, which makes you feel sleepy. Many times, you need to stop doing something and rest. For example, you may find yourself having to turn off the TV or computer when you wake up.\nQuestion: How often should I check my blood sugar levels?\nAnswer: \nIf your blood sugar level rises, even slightly, or stays high for a prolonged period of time, it may indicate a problem. While it's important to see a doctor every 3 months or so to check your condition, checking your sugar level monthly can catch a lot of problems before they start, so it's always worth keeping track.\nQuestion: Should I drink water or juice?\nAnswer: \nDrinking fluids helps maintain normal fluid balance throughout the body and is particularly important if you are going to be driving or operating machinery.

Your doctor will be able to tell you which ones are most important to treat. Ask your doctor for some help in finding out what those symptoms are.\bAnswer: What happens when I get a cold?\nFull Answer: Colds occur when viruses and bacteria enter the body through tiny cuts on your skin. They normally cause only mild discomfort, but they can worsen if not treated right away. Some people are more susceptible than others because of factors like race, gender, genetics and immune system strength.\bAnswer: How does my blood type work?\nFull Answer: Blood types are determined by your genes -- these are strands of DNA passed down from parent to child. Each person's genes determine how he or she responds to foods and medications. So, just as there are two types of apples, there are also three types of people: Type A, Type B and Type O. If you don't know which kind of apple to pick, ask your doctor about food allergies. Many foods contain ingredients that react differently to certain blood groups.\bAnswer: Who developed the polio vaccine?\nFull Answer: Dr. Jonas Salk was one of the first scientists to develop a vaccine against polio, a dangerous childhood illness. As early as 1946, he had already published research demonstrating its effectiveness. In 1950, his colleagues Maurice Hilleman, Louis Pasteur, Albert Sabin and Edward Jenner started working together on developing the vaccine. Salk found a small strain of monkey kidney virus, known as SV40, that caused paralysis in laboratory animals and led him to believe that it would work in humans. He made a few small human test trials in 1953, 1954 and 1955 using live polio vaccines produced by the American Cyanamid Company. However, after reviewing the results, Salk decided not to proceed with further development.\bAnswer: Is it true that eating too much sugar increases your chances of getting diabetes?\nFull Answer: Sugar contributes to a number of diseases including obesity, hypertension, high cholesterol levels, heart failure and type 2 diabetes.

gpt2-xl_57,"\u201cThe first stage of MS is called relapsing remitting (RR), which occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the brain. The second phase starts several weeks later, with more severe symptoms called secondary progressive MS (SPMS) which can last for many years. There is also some evidence that SPMS may be caused by an auto-immune disease called relapsing antigen-specific T-cell lymphoma or RASL.\r

\r

While there is no cure for SPMS and there are no known treatments, scientists have found ways to slow its progression through gene therapy, immunosuppressive drugs, and blood cell transplants. In addition, scientists have developed new ways to detect and treat the disease.\r

\r

In general, experts agree that it's unlikely that people will develop SPMS without early detection and treatment. That said, there is currently no cure for RRMS; only therapies that delay its onset and progress slowly enough that people don't lose their ability to function.\r

\r

Many doctors recommend taking certain medications like prednisone or interferon alfa-2b before getting MS symptoms, but this is not a surefire way to prevent MS from developing. Some studies suggest that these medications might actually increase the risk of development of MS. Still others have suggested that they may help prevent the disease if taken at the right time.\r

If you do get MS symptoms, make sure to seek professional care as soon as possible because they're usually worse in those who develop MS late.\r

Healthy Living Question #23 Should I Eat More Fish?\r

Answer: Yes!\r

\r

Fish contain omega-3 fatty acids, which promote healthy skin, hair, joints, and connective tissues throughout the body. Omega-3s are essential to normal brain functioning, especially memory. They are also important to our vision, heart health, and overall well being.\r

\r

Studies show that eating fish helps lower cholesterol levels, prevents heart disease, lowers triglycerides (fatty deposits in the bloodstream), reduces inflammation, strengthens bones, boosts immunity, protects against cancer, and aids digestion. It is also rich in protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.\r

gpt2-xl_86,"MS is a progressive disease that affects the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). The symptoms of MS usually begin between age 40 and 60 years old and progress over time. In early stages of the disease, there may be little or no noticeable changes in your appearance; however, as the disease progresses you will develop many symptoms. Some people experience more severe side effects with MS than others. There is no cure for MS but it can often be managed through medication.\cite{Fouhy_MS_20120328} Question: Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis\nAnswer: Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis is a form of multiple sclerosis that develops in individuals who have not had an immune response from their first infection with MS bacteria (in other words, they have been infected previously without developing symptoms) and have not responded to an immunotherapy drug regimen. This type of MS is called Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.\cite{Mueller_2013_PPMMRS} \end{equation*}\begin{axis}1 & = {\left[\frac{3}{{\sqrt {2}}}}} \times 10^{4} \\ \left( {\rho } \right)= - 2 {\pi x} \times {\rm r^2} \\ \left(\frac{4}{{\sqrt {2}}}\right)= 1 {\rm m^2} + 4 {\rm m}+ 5 {\rm L} \end{axis} Question: I am having trouble finding a good doctor to treat my chronic pain. What is the best place to go? Complete Answer: Your doctor should make sure that he/she is able to diagnose and treat your condition. A good doctor will be aware of the different kinds of chronic pain and will know how to identify those patients that are most likely to respond well to different types of treatments. For example, a general practitioner could recommend treatment for chronic back pain, while a specialist would need to determine which medications work better for a particular patient's condition. When selecting a physician, make sure that both the doctor and the insurance company are willing to cover some of the costs associated with treatment. Also, ensure that the doctor has sufficient education and training before taking on such a complicated task, which may include consulting experts like neurologists and psychiatrists. Lastly, check out our article on choosing a healthcare provider for chronic pain.

For example, Alzheimer's disease is considered one such disease (Alzheimer's Disease). This is why some experts recommend that you consult an independent doctor before taking this medication. The fact is that many doctors do not know about all the possible causes for your condition. If it turns out that the symptoms you're experiencing have nothing to do with MS, then you should definitely consider changing your prescription drug regimen.

Ask Dr. Novella: Is it true that certain types of food increase my risk of developing CFS/ME? What does this mean for me as a patient who wants to avoid eating these foods?

Answer: Yes. Eating a diet rich in saturated fats, red meat, dairy products, sugar and refined carbohydrates is associated with increased risk of CFS/ME.\r

Dr. Novella's Response: I am surprised by this response! While most studies suggest that dietary fat and carbohydrate intake has no direct impact on CFS/ME, the evidence linking SFA consumption to inflammation, immune system activation, brain atrophy, depression and autoimmune disease is quite compelling. The only explanation for such findings could be that consuming these nutrient dense foods has a positive effect on your ability to control systemic inflammation and autoimmune processes.


Some foods that contribute to inflammation include:

Animal fats: Pork, beef, lamb, chicken, tuna, shellfish, nuts, seeds, olive oil, corn, soybean and peanut oils, processed breakfast cereals, and margarine.

Saturated fats: Butter, lard, palm oil, cocoa butter, and hydrogenated vegetable oils like partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (trans-fats)

gpt2-xl_72,"The use of antiviral medicines during pregnancy and in the first three months after giving birth does not increase your risk of having a child with autism. Your baby's immune system will have been strengthened by his or her exposure to a virus that is not present in breast milk. This is why vaccines are given to babies before they're born. As long as you do not smoke, drink alcohol, take prescription medications, or eat foods containing gluten, there is no known risk from using multiple sclerosis drugs while pregnant. If you are on any of these drugs, consult your doctor because you may want to avoid certain vaccines. However, if you think you might be at higher risk for an adverse reaction, talk to your doctor about how to manage it. See your doctor regularly throughout your pregnancy to ensure that he or she is monitoring your condition carefully.\nQuestions: I am concerned my children might get measles. Can I make them unvaccinated?\nAnswer: There has never been a case of measles in San Diego County since 1962. Although many parents believe their children are protected against measles by being vaccinated against it, this is not true. Measles can spread easily among even vaccinated people. Therefore, parents who choose to vaccinate their children should consider doing so for their own protection and those of others around them. Ask your pediatrician what options are available for you.\nHow long can a person remain fully immunized?\nAnswer: A person must receive all four doses (of MMR) before entering school. It takes approximately six weeks until a full dose is produced, and six more weeks before two doses can be administered. In other words, a person would need to wait nine (9)-10 months after vaccination for everyone involved in the vaccine schedule to meet their minimum requirement. If someone else in the household is also receiving an MMR shot, then only one dose would need to be given at each visit until the person whose shot was scheduled for the next visit could receive another dose. Children younger than five years old are vaccinated once every 12 months.

gpt2-xl_79,"No, multiple sclerosis cannot be passed from one parent to another by way of a genetic mutation. However, you may have inherited the condition in the form of a recessive gene (one that is dominant, but not active) or from your mother's side. Genetic tests can determine whether you are genetically predisposed to multiple sclerosis. A screening test at least three years after conception would also help with this determination. The only way to know for sure is if there is some kind of prenatal diagnosis, which would require an amniocentesis, CVS, or chorionic villus sampling. If these tests were positive, it could mean that you were born with multiple sclerosis. Alternatively, a maternal infection such as cytomegalovirus or herpes simplex virus could have been transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy and lead to the development of MS.\nIncorrectAnswer: Yes. Your mother was infected when she was pregnant. She had a low risk of transmitting the disease to you as her immune system was already weakened by HIV/AIDS infection and untreated diabetes. At birth, she also suffered from congenital heart defects, so passing a rare disease like MS on to you could very well happen. There are many ways around this problem though - most importantly, having two healthy parents who share all necessary information is usually enough to make sure no additional siblings suffer from MS\nQuestion: My son has autism, what should I do?\r

Complete Answer: This question requires more discussion than is possible here. In general, families with children with autism will find themselves in a number of different situations throughout their journey. Each situation will involve its own set of choices based upon the needs of each child and the skills needed. For example, an autistic child who is socially awkward and easily bored may need to be taught basic manners and social interaction skills. An older boy who struggles with language skills might benefit from therapy to teach him how to speak. Parents may choose to pursue certain activities for their autistic child such as occupational therapy, speech and physical therapies, art therapy, or even musical training. When parents decide to pursue some specific goal, they must first discuss the situation with their pediatrician. It is important to mention that the decision to pursue a particular activity or skill does not necessarily imply that a child has been diagnosed with autism or any type of developmental disorder. Because there is such a wide range of factors involved in choosing specific goals and practices, it is advisable for families to seek professional guidance before proceeding.\r

""What can I do to prevent my child from developing Alzheimer's?"" \mComplete Answer: The good news is that there are many things you can do right now to reduce your childrens risk of developing Alzheimer's. These include:\n1. Avoiding any exposure to toxins including pesticides;2. Eating a healthy diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, meat and fish.\n3. Exercise regularly, particularly aerobic exercise (such as walking);4. Not smoking;5. Being physically active on at least three days each week;6. Keeping blood pressure and cholesterol levels under control, especially if you have diabetes. \n7. Smoking cessation. As a mother and a grandmother, this answer is personal. But it's also practical. So, please take a moment today to think about how you can protect your family by reducing your childrens exposure to toxic substances - particularly the ones we're discussing in this webinar. \n8. Checking the food labels on everything you buy. Look for products labeled ""Contains Less Than 1% Of Commonly Used Toxic Substance,"" or even just ""Toxic Substances And Chemicals."" If you see such a label, don't eat it! Instead, contact the manufacturer directly and ask them what ingredients are included. You might want to start your discussion with a simple ""thank you!"" If you still find it necessary to purchase such a product, you may wish to consult an organic farmer who knows what he's doing. Your local grocery store probably offers some excellent information about organic foods. Also, read up on your state laws regarding toxic materials, and get involved with your local government.\ n9. Consider using natural ways to help manage disease. A recent study in the journal Brain found that natural anti-inflammatory herbs like St John's Wort prevented memory loss among rats after being fed a chemical neurotoxin known as N-(pyridin-1-yl)-N′-methylbenzamide (BANM).

Q. My husband doesn't like my hair cut short or long. How can I keep him happy? A. You can't always change someone else's expectations of you, but you can make sure to communicate yours honestly. Whether you decide to let your hair grow a little longer or decide to take care of some unwanted hair growth, you can do so without worrying about pleasing others. Try asking your spouse if he likes your current look. Be confident with his answer. Do your best to match the look of your hair color to your natural coloring. That way, he will accept your decision. But don't pressure him into having short hair by telling him how much better it will be to shave off a few inches than trimming down. Instead, give him the opportunity to see how a shorter haircut looks after a week. The truth is that most men who think their wife shouldn't wear her hair short don't really understand women in general, or how women usually feel about their own appearance. Sometimes they want to see how a different style looks on other people instead of comparing your hair length to theirs. And sometimes they don't even realize women actually feel good about themselves regardless of their appearance! So rather than being offended or angry, try showing interest in how others' styles look. Also, remember that many people will probably enjoy watching how you manage your own appearance. Asking questions such as ""Have you ever thought of cutting your hair?"" or ""Does your hair feel nice today?"" can help encourage your husband to",130,neck and shoulder stretches,-0.0274256635457277,0,multimedqa,7,0.0,436,15

gpt2-xl_101,"A doctor would likely diagnose you with leukocytosis (a form of swollen lymph nodes) or an overactive immune system. These conditions may be caused by a virus, fungus, infection, tumors, and/or other serious conditions that can affect your lungs and organs. However, there is no evidence at this time that exposure to radiation from ionizing radiation causes these diseases. In fact, a person may become ill from the sun even without ever having been exposed to it. This condition could occur after exposure to sunlight for several hours during a day or week, or even in a brief period of exposure at night when the UV rays pass through windows. When this occurs, the body's immune response will trigger an inflammatory reaction in your lung cells called Epstein-Barr virus infection. Other possibilities include allergic rhinitis (allergy to dust mites), sinusitis, allergies, asthma, hay fever, and upper respiratory infections such as pneumonia. The key point here is that there has not yet been any scientific proof that the direct effects of radiation on the human body produce adverse effects. It is possible that some people experience more symptoms than others due to genetic factors or lifestyle choices.\r

The optimal diet for preventing chronic disease includes foods rich in nutrients like calcium, zinc, vitamin C, selenium, potassium, iron, copper, omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, protein, magnesium and vitamin D. If you need more help with this question or want even more specifics, check out our guide here:How Much Fats Should You Eat?\nAnswer: A calorie is not just a calorie; it's also a kilocalorie (cal). To find out how many calories you're burning at rest and during exercise, consult your physician. Complete Answer: Your body uses fat as its main source of fuel. Because of this, a calorie is actually equal to 4.2 grams of carbohydrate (CHO) plus 1 gram of protein plus 0.8 grams of fat. That means each 100 calories burned will be comprised of 28% fat, 50% CHO, and 22% protein. You don't have to worry too much about the exact number because we'll talk about exactly what those numbers mean later on. How Much Water Do I Need Each Day?\nComplete Answer: Drink 8 glasses of fluid per day. There are no specific amounts listed anywhere, so there isn't really an answer to this one either, but the general consensus is 2 liters of fluids per pound of body weight every day. How Many Calories Are in a Pound of Fat?\nComplete Answer: 1,200+ Calories. However, if you can make the argument that the amount of energy stored in fat is greater than the caloric value of the same amount of energy stored in carbohydrates, then you might argue that you should consume more carbs to compensate for the difference. One way to do this would be by eating breakfast before hitting the gym. It seems counterintuitive to eat something like cereal or toast for breakfast, since it could take hours to digest those carbs before you feel full. But according to the Mayo Clinic, eating breakfast may not only keep you full longer, it may also reduce insulin resistance. Another way to get around the problem of meal timing is by incorporating high-fat snacks throughout the day, which you can easily make yourself through high-protein smoothies.

In psychotherapeutic therapy, the therapist helps patients cope with their symptoms by helping them change behavior patterns that lead to their negative thoughts and feelings (such as anxiety or depressive disorders).\nQuestion: is there any relationship between psychotherapy and psychoanalysis?\nAnswer: There are many similarities between these two areas of study, but in particular the therapeutic application of psychoanalysis differs from the use of psychoanalytic theory in psychotherapy. For example, in psychoanalytical theory, the goal of treatment is to uncover and understand some aspect of the patient's own life history, whereas in psychotherapy the focus is on changing maladaptive behaviors such as eating and sleeping habits.\nQuestion: what are the main differences between the psychotherapeutic and the psychoanalytic perspectives on a patient's mental illness?\nAnswer: The primary differences are that in psychotherapeutic therapy the emphasis is on improving an individual's mood and making positive changes in interpersonal relations rather than on investigating aspects of the patient's past (e.g., exploring personal tragedies), whereas in psychoanalytical analysis the aim is to reveal underlying themes (e.g., examining the patient's religious beliefs, personality characteristics) that help explain certain cognitive distortions (e.g., splitting the self into the ""I"" and ""not I"") that manifest themselves in clinical illness.\n

gpt2-xl_108,"\nCerebral edema is a general term used for an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain (cerebrospinal fluid). It can also refer to excess fluid in or around the spinal cord. It may be associated with signs and symptoms of other conditions such as stroke, meningitis, encephalopathy, or traumatic brain injury. Symptoms include headache, dizziness, fatigue, loss of concentration, confusion, disorientation, and unsteady gait or balance (myalgias). Common causes of cerebral edema include trauma (e.g., car accident), infection, head trauma, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and metabolic disorders (e.g., obesity, hypertension). The severity of cerebral edema depends on the location of the accumulation of fluid and the amount of water present. For example, cerebral edema that occurs within the spinal cord is more severe than that which develops outside it. As a rule, cerebral edema of less than 3 liters (about 8 ounces) per 10 liters of blood is not life threatening and does not require immediate treatment; however, if there is excessive amounts of fluid within the central nervous system (CNS) then it requires evaluation by a physician\nAnswer: \nA person's age alone cannot determine their potential risk of developing cognitive impairment from an underlying cause, such as Alzheimer disease.

Example: Mary has a high cholesterol level and is 50 years old. Her family doctor recommends she have her total cholesterol measured annually because that may indicate her increased risk of developing dementia. However, Dr. Smith reports that he recently performed a physical examination that revealed Mrs. Smith had no evidence of atherosclerotic plaques or plaque build up in her arteries, but he did notice her elevated LDL (""bad"") cholesterol level was slightly higher at 6.6. He then decided to perform a detailed neurological exam on Mrs. Smith to confirm his findings. Based on this review, he advises that he will order a further electrocardiogram and perform a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan later this month to evaluate the progression of her dementia. If Mrs. Smith were only 40 years old, then the risks would most likely outweigh any benefits of her additional screening test.\r

The best way to learn more is through the books below. See also these two videos from my series on Diabetes Knowledge in Action for an overview. Question: How do I know if I have type 1 or type 2 diabetes?\nAnswer: Both types have the same genetic predisposition to develop diabetes, though they present different symptoms at different times. Type 1 is caused by a defect in the genes that code for insulin, while type 2 occurs due to damage to beta cells in the pancreas, causing them to produce too much insulin. It's important to note that both types of diabetes affect people differently. For example, type 1 diabetes has no known cure, whereas type 2 requires immediate surgery to remove the damaged beta cells (and often results in permanent blindness). Also, while type 2 diabetes usually occurs with a shorter duration than type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes typically develops in adulthood and is more serious. If you're interested in learning more, check out my page Type 1 vs Type 2 Diabetes or this short video on how to determine your type. Question: What are some of the treatments for type 1 diabetes and what should I expect?\nAnswer: Unfortunately, there isn't any one treatment that works for everyone. However, there are several therapies that can reduce symptoms without making any long term effects on blood glucose levels. These include oral antidiabetic agents like metformin, sulfonylureas, pioglitazone, nateglinide, sulfonamides, glipizide, and others; intravenous insulin delivery devices such as insulin pumps and insulin pens; and dietary measures such as increasing whole grain consumption, consuming fewer sweets and processed foods, and reducing sodium intake. This is just a small sample of many available treatment options. Check with your doctor before starting any new medication or dietary measure unless otherwise directed. You'll find even more information on treating type 1 diabetes here: http://www.diabetesinfo.org/treatment/. Question: Is the cost of living related to how much diabetes I'm having?\nAnswer: Not exactly. Living costs vary depending on where you live and whether you qualify for financial assistance programs.

In some people, stomach acid is necessary for proper digestion so it is important to consume foods containing calcium. Also avoid drinking lots of water at any one time as this can cause problems with stomach acid, which could lead to dehydration. An occasional meal high in protein and fat along with a healthy amount of carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, fiber and other nutrients can help replenish depleted stores and build up muscle strength while reducing cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

If you are pregnant or breast feeding then you might want to consider drinking less alcohol or avoid getting into situations where alcohol is likely to be present, such as at parties. If you are allergic to aspirin, check that your medicine contains aspirin before taking it.

What does my employer contribute toward my care? The employer's share of your out-of-pocket costs is equal to 60 percent of your total annual compensation, including wages, bonuses, commissions, profit sharing, tips, and taxable fringe benefits. For example, in 2017, an employee who makes $60,000 per year would pay $5,960 into his or her individual retirement account (IRA). The employer's contribution is 40 percent ($4,040) of that amount, which equals $2,240. Thus, the employee pays $2,120. In addition, if an employer contributes towards the employee's insurance premiums using payroll deductions rather than cash payments, the employee will pay 30 percent of those premium charges directly to their insurer. For 2016, contributions were estimated as follows: Employer contribution 60% of salary or $4,040 Employee contribution 40% of salary or $2,720 Total annual benefit of $7,480

gpt2-xl_77,"Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that attacks the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. Symptoms of MS may include vision loss, numbness and tingling in hands, legs or feet, paralysis, muscle weakness, and difficulty walking, speaking, swallowing, swallowing again, and getting around (dysarthria). Menopausal symptoms are often confused with MS. However, they are distinct conditions caused by different underlying causes. \rAnswer: A woman's menstrual cycle can affect her ability to tolerate pain. Women who have regular periods for a long time also tend to experience more pain than those women who menstruate irregularly or not at all. This pain comes from nerve endings on the vulva, cervix, labia, and upper thighs. Although there are many types of pain disorders, these come from nerve signals sent throughout the body by specific areas of the nervous system. The problem occurs when nerve endings send too much signal or cause other problems that make them feel worse than normal. Pain that arises during intercourse will likely be due to the nerves that transmit pain messages. If you have had the surgery to remove your uterus, you will probably experience some pain during sex, but most people will never notice this. This type of pain is known as dyspareunia. You may need medications if your pain lasts longer than 3 weeks. Common medications include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and others; antidepressants like sertraline, desipramine, and others; anticonvulsant medications including gabapentin; beta blockers (e.g., amitriptyline); tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline, imipramine, and others; and opioid analgesics. Certain foods and herbal supplements can help treat symptoms of dyspareunia. When your symptoms become unbearable, it is important to seek immediate medical attention because they could indicate a serious condition requiring emergency treatment. For example, if you find yourself unable to get out of bed or go about daily activities, immediately call 911 or your local emergency room. \r

You should also know that when you disclose your MS, there is no requirement that you take any medication, and it may actually make you more comfortable with co-workers since they do not need to learn anything new from an illness of yours. In addition, if you discuss MS with your employer's HR department, they will typically ask you to meet them for a short period before returning to work and then promptly notify you of their decision based upon what you revealed during this meeting. It is important to remember that you must never reveal a medical condition until after the fact - it is inappropriate to disclose information prior to receiving a positive response (e.g., ""I'm so glad I found out!"") from a doctor.

\nAnswer: Disclosing Multiple Sclerosis at Work\u00a0Answer: The first thing you should do is find out what kind of job you're applying for; what kind of environment you'll be working in is another issue altogether. For example, if you're employed as a research scientist for a pharmaceutical company, it might seem like a good idea to disclose your MS. However, many companies prefer employees who aren't too forthcoming about diseases (like MS), but don't want to risk losing out on potential new hires. Therefore, it may make sense for you to wait until after you've been offered employment at the company to ask about MS. However, even after being hired, you should definitely come clean as soon as possible. While your boss shouldn't be penalized for doing so, it might still give off the impression that you're hiding something.

The ketogenic diet is an extremely effective way to quickly improve diabetes control while reducing the risk of DKA. Low carb diets, on the other hand, have been shown to not only cause significant weight gain but also increase risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, cancer, and type 2 diabetes. The bottom line is that most major health organizations agree that low carb diets are neither safe nor effective in treating diabetes. When you decide to start following a ketogenic/keto diet, remember these four important things:\nFirst and foremost, don't try this at home without first consulting with your physician. Make sure you get adequate food intake, exercise regularly, and follow a healthy lifestyle. It's completely normal to experience some initial discomfort during your first few weeks of a new diet plan.

gpt2-xl_97,"Physical Activity is one of the best things you can do for your body. It burns calories which helps keep up with weight gain or loss. You burn more calories by walking than driving. Some studies suggest that people who walk three miles a day have lower risk of heart disease.\nQuestion: what is the difference between aerobic and anaerobic exercise?\nAnswer: Anaerobic exercise refers to exercises involving the production of lactic acid (a waste product in most muscle cells) instead of oxygen. The faster a person runs, the more lactic acid produced. Aerobic exercises include jogging or cycling.\nQuestion: how many calories does running burn per mile?\nAnswer: Each mile you run burns approximately 300 to 400 calories. Running will give you a burning sensation but it doesn't make you fatter than you would be if you didn't run. If you want to lose weight running will not help you get there. When you're trying to lose fat the first thing you should focus on is reducing your calorie intake.\nQuestion: why do people quit exercising after they start losing weight?\nAnswer: Because once a person starts exercising all their willpower goes out the window. Exercise is hard work and sometimes you just don't feel like doing it anymore. Once a person stops exercising they will become physically weaker making them more susceptible to injury. People who stop exercising for any reason often find it harder to maintain their weight losses than those who stay active and eat well.\nQuestion: what are the benefits of exercise compared to dieting?\nAnswer: Exercise is a natural source of energy. The body has a limited amount of energy so when someone consumes too much food or drinks too much caffeine they will eventually need to consume less calories. However, this only works if the person continues to do other forms of exercise. Dieting tends to leave a person's body feeling hungry and wanting more food. If we restrict our diets as much as possible then our bodies will use any remaining energy to store calories. We will also likely be eating a larger portion of food to compensate for the lost caloric value from the diet. In short, dieting causes us to eat more and burn fewer calories than we normally would. When we exercise we provide our bodies with a steady flow of calories throughout the day. This gives our bodies more time to burn through excess calories without having to worry about overproducing lactic acid.\nQuestion: what is exercise based weight loss diet?\nAnswer: As mentioned above, physical",97,benefits of physical activity,-0.7313868999481201,57,multimedqa,8,0.2556053811659193,418,14

As long as you can do the same number of repetitions and get similar results from each session, it's all good. If you still need more information, go ahead and look up some guidelines in a book or online site; they may help you determine what kind of activity is best suited for your needs. Question: How does my body hold on to fat? \NComplete Answer: When it comes to burning calories, there is no such thing as lean muscle. Muscle tissue is made of many different types of cells -- from connective tissues (muscles) down through the nuclei (cells that make DNA). Each type of cell has specialized functions like absorbing nutrients, transporting oxygen, synthesizing proteins, making hormones, etc., but these function also depend on the type of muscle tissue it contains. In general, when you lose muscle mass, this decreases the amount of calories available to be burned by your muscles, which ultimately causes weight loss. This in turn reduces your ability to burn calories at any given time. You should try to maintain your current level of strength and size if you're trying to gain more body fat. To lose weight quickly, you can either reduce caloric intake, cut back on exercise, or change your eating habits. These strategies will result in weight loss within several weeks if you don't increase your calorie intake beyond your maintenance levels. For example, if you start out eating 500 calories per day, keep it at that level until you've lost 10 pounds or so, then gradually decrease your intake to 400 calories per day to help you achieve your goal. Once your diet has been adjusted and you're losing weight, start increasing your calorie intake again to reach your desired weight. Remember though, maintaining your current weight is crucial because once you drop off, you'll have to begin the process over again. Also note that even small amounts of increased food intake will lead to significant reductions in calories consumed per day, which means that if you suddenly increase your calorie consumption to 2,000 calories per day, you could easily consume between 1,800 -2,200 extra calories without noticing it. Question: Why do people gain weight and why does it not return after a few months? \NAnswer: Weight gain occurs naturally because our bodies store excess energy as fat.

In addition, it's hard for people with poor socioeconomic status to obtain good health insurance coverage. It's also challenging for doctors to find enough qualified applicants willing to take the test for residency programs. So, doctors tend to look down on others and refuse to take patients they deem unqualified. In my opinion, the system needs to change dramatically if the public wants quality healthcare. I feel that the government must create an alternative funding source for hospitals, schools, clinics, and other necessary infrastructure needed to deliver high quality healthcare services.

It is important for them to know what can cause these reactions, especially since many of the products available today contain ingredients which the body does not recognize as harmful.\r

Many medications such as antibiotics or antifungals will trigger symptoms if taken on a regular basis at the same time they are prescribed. Ask your doctor how frequently these treatments should be administered and whether any side effects are expected.\r

Finally, remember that although most kids will outgrow some or all of their allergies, there is no cure for allergies. It is best for children to avoid food allergies altogether, while giving them all the benefits of a healthy diet.

Also, as your body begins using new muscles to replace old ones, you may notice some improvement after only a few months of treatment.\r

Answer: Most patients with MS experience significant improvements from the initial first dose of medicine used during an MS course of therapy. Although there is still much to learn about how MS affects the brain and spinal cord, scientists now know that MS affects many other parts of the body, including the nervous system. These changes can affect both physical symptoms such as fatigue, pain, stiffness, weakness, vision problems, hearing problems, bladder and bowel control, and muscle tone.\r

If you have been diagnosed with MS, it's important to talk to your doctor about any side effects that you might be concerned about because they could influence your choices when deciding on medication. As always, we encourage you to do your own research before taking any medications. Ask your doctor questions to help determine if a particular drug is right for you. Be sure to get all the information needed regarding any medications prescribed to treat MS so you can make informed decisions based on accurate information. \r

gpt2-xl_102,"Eczema is one of the most commonly diagnosed skin conditions in America. It occurs when your body's immune system reacts to an infection. The more severe it gets, the greater your risk for developing allergies, asthma, hay fever, or other allergic diseases.\r

\r

Learn how to tell if your skin is at risk for this condition \r

\r

Answer: Your skin contains a natural defense that helps protect you from these infections. While you may not have ever heard of this system, your skin does a remarkable job of keeping out foreign substances that might cause irritation. If you're exposed to something irritating, such as an insect bite, bug sting, or poison ivy, your immune system will quickly send chemicals into your bloodstream to neutralize the threat. However, your skin also has its own secret weapons that help fight off these invaders. These special cells can also be stimulated by certain medications or environmental factors, so you probably know them better than I do. These immune cells release histamine, which reduces inflammation. When there is too much inflammation on your skin, it can lead to chronic itching and rashes, as well as acne and psoriasis. You could use some basic information on the history of your eczema or your symptoms to help determine whether you've had enough exposure to an irritant and respond with appropriate anti-inflammatory treatment. Ask yourself questions like: Have I been taking any medicines? How long ago were they taken? Do I feel any more tender after using them? How often did I take them? Are my dermatologist's recommendations consistent with what I'm seeing now?\r

\r

Your skin contains different types of cells that are responsible for regulating the amount of inflammation in your skin. If your body is under constant stress (such as a cold), then your skin becomes inflamed, producing even more histamine. This means that your skin should receive less histamine from your environment or medicines. But sometimes your skin does need extra protection from something, whether because you've just been exposed to an infection or you're overworking your immune system. A good way to test to see if the level of inflammation you experience is normal or excessive is through a simple skin prick test. Take two small specks of dried skin and place each one directly onto a cotton ball. Then touch both sides of your face and rub them together until they become moist. Repeat this process with four specks of dry skin. After you've tested all five areas, take",102,randomly gotten eczema,-4.7683305740356445,22,multimedqa,8,0.22448979591836735,419,2

gpt2-xl_63,"Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the central nervous system. People with MS have weakness in one or more of their central nervous systems. These people usually experience numbness, paralysis, muscle spasms, difficulty walking, swallowing, talking and breathing. Some people may be able to walk but others cannot. Others may need special equipment (automated devices) to stand up and walk properly. It can take months to years for the symptoms to resolve completely, and it may never fully resolve.\r

Most people with MS eventually experience some improvement, which varies from person to person, age group, gender, and whether the disease was diagnosed early on or late in the course of the illness. While there are medications available to help manage the effects of MS, most people do not respond well to them.\r

Other conditions may impact your ability to work. For example, many people who have been diagnosed with MS may not recover quickly enough to resume full time employment due to ongoing fatigue, pain and/or disability. Other conditions such as depression, heart problems, kidney failure, diabetes, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may also require you to stay home from work to rest. Although these situations may sound alarming, they are extremely rare. The best way to know if you should stay at home or return to work is to talk to your doctor.\r

Q3: What should I tell my patients when they ask me questions?\r

A3: When someone asks me what the latest news about MS is, what is the first thing I recommend she do? If she has any questions about how the disease progresses or what her prognosis might be, what information to use to inform decisions, etc., I suggest she contact her family physician, neurologist, or other healthcare provider.\r

If she knows what kind of treatment she is receiving, I strongly encourage her to learn as much as she can about MS treatments and research before making any major life changes. One reason we think learning about medical research is important is because we often hear from patients concerned that doctors will refuse to provide certain kinds of care based on a patient's condition or financial status, which prevents them from getting necessary care that could reduce their risk of progression. However, physicians often give patients information about current medical research in order to guide them through treatment options and make informed decisions. This approach helps prevent unnecessary costs and delays. Additionally, our results show that knowing more about MS can increase patients' confidence in the effectiveness of their medication choices",63,Will multiple sclerosis affect my career?,-0.0475953817367553,4,multimedqa,8,0.016,427,4

The disease results from immune system cells (T helper cells) mistakenly attacking our own nerves. A person with MS has abnormal white blood cell production. This imbalance makes the brain more susceptible to attack by the immune system and triggers symptoms such as numbness, tingling, pain, weakness, loss of balance, depression, trouble speaking, and vision problems. If left untreated, these conditions can result in disability or death. \r

Anxiety disorders (including phobias)

Stress

Bipolar disorder

ADD/ADHD

Somatic anxiety

Generalized Anxiety Disorder *

*If you are not sure if your condition falls under one of these categories, please contact your doctor first. \nWhy do some people have more than one type of illness?\nAnswer: There is no single answer for why some people have more than one type of illness. It's important to understand that many psychological and physical illnesses are co-morbid - meaning they occur together. For example, depression and chronic pain can both cause symptoms such as fatigue and pain sensitivity. In addition, there is evidence that certain genes influence susceptibility to various mental and physical disorders. Your genetics could also play a role in how you respond to treatment. An estimated 30% of Americans suffer from at least one psychological stressor, such as severe financial hardship or divorce, each year.*What does the word ""mental"" mean?\nAnswer: Mental means thinking, feeling, perceiving, and acting, as well as thinking about or doing things. Some examples include feelings and beliefs; thoughts and perceptions; actions and impulses; memories and feelings; attitudes and behaviors; ideas and concepts; and ways of relating to others.\nHow does the word ""affective"" differ from the word ""mood""?\nAnswer: When someone says ""I feel sad,"" what they really mean is ""my mood changed."" However, when someone says ""I'm angry,"" they're actually referring to a situation where their mood has become negative. People often use emotional expressions to express a range of emotions - including sadness, anger, fear, surprise, excitement, and joy.\nDo you have any mental health information available to me?\nAnswer: Yes! We provide mental health care information on our website in three categories: Medical Resources, Tips & Techniques, and Self Care. Each category offers information on general health issues, prevention and treatment resources, self-care guides, and coping strategies.

Schizophrenia is more serious in its implications on quality of life as well as physical health.\nQuestion: what causes BPD? \tComplete answer: People with borderline personality disorder (BPD) have a pattern of emotional instability that includes unstable relationships, self-destructive behaviors, and recurrent suicidal thoughts and actions. It is not known exactly how these feelings develop but they can include many different factors including childhood abuse, neglect, abandonment, or trauma. A person with BPD may also have other mental disorders such as: bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, eating disorders, substance use disorders, psychosis, conduct disorder, and antisocial personality disorder.\t Question: What is the prognosis for someone who has borderline personality disorder? Complete Answer: The best outcome for people with BPD is long term treatment. Most people with BPD will achieve full recovery from their emotions.

""In patients with relapsing MS, the symptoms usually begin within six months after the onset of symptoms; however, some patients may experience relapses up to five years after their initial diagnosis."" \r

""As with any infection, there are many different types that lead to chronic inflammatory conditions such as MS.""

""Another theory proposes that the immune response against CNS tissue cells is not adequate, resulting in excessive production of proinflammatory proteins and cytokine molecules.

The most important cause of MS is the immune system attacking your brain cells (neurofibrillary tangles) because the two do not get along. This makes up an estimated 40% of all cases. The other main cause of MS is environmental factors such as smoking or exposure to toxins in food and water. For this reason it is very likely that certain medications you take will decrease your chances for developing MS.

Other important causes of MS include autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, systemic lupus erythematosus, celiac disease, scleroderma, polymyositis, fibromyalgia, eczema, psoriasis, allergies, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, malnutrition, stress, alcoholism, drugs, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and many others.\r

Question: What is a brain scan? Complete Answer: A brain scan is a procedure that uses x rays or other imaging techniques to show the structure of your brain and how it functions. The technique can be used to diagnose disease or determine treatment effectiveness for neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and cerebral palsy.\rQuestion: What is a brain MRI test?\rAnswer: A brain MRI (magnetic resonance imager) is an advanced form of radiography that uses magnetic pulses to create pictures of areas inside the brain. It provides information on the thickness of the cortex (the outer layer of nerve cells), which plays a critical role in cognition. These images may also help doctors determine where and when a person has been injured during surgery.\rQuestion: How does a blood test measure glucose levels?\rComplete Answer: Glucose (sugar) is one of the body's most important fuels. When your blood sugar level drops too low, symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, heartburn, nausea, or vomiting can occur. High levels of sugar in the bloodstream can cause high blood pressure and irregular heartbeat. If you have diabetes, your doctor will monitor your blood sugar level by taking glucose readings at regular intervals. Some types of medications, like some insulin shots, can lower your blood sugar levels. Your doctor will prescribe medication to treat low blood sugar conditions.\rQuestion: How do I tell if I've had an allergic reaction to milk products?\rAnswer: Milk contains proteins called casein and whey, both of which can trigger allergy reactions. Avoid foods with these ingredients, especially those containing lactose. There are few foods that contain casein and no lactose. For example, soy milk and many varieties of rice milk are not made with casein and are safe to consume without causing a reaction.\rQuestion: How do I know if my baby might be having a thyroid disorder?\rAnswer: Thyroid disorders can result in serious health problems. In most cases, these disorders affect children younger than age 6 months. Symptoms include depression, fatigue, weight loss, and muscle aches. While there isn't a specific diagnosis, doctors usually order a series of laboratory tests before diagnosing thyroid problems. Most people with thyroid disorders do well on thyroid hormone replacement therapy. However, certain individuals should get their thyroid checked every year so they don't develop new problems.\r",95,Reading problems in MS,-8.05942440032959,68,multimedqa,8,0.3222748815165877,393,5

Q. How long does it take for me to feel better? \nComplete Answer: Your body will naturally recover from any physical activity you perform within two hours or less. The recovery time can vary based on factors such as your age, what type of exercise you've done previously, and how much water you drank during the workout. In some cases, the recovery time may be longer because there may be a secondary impact from an injury.\r


Q. I have been experiencing this symptom for months, when do I need to see my doctor? \nComplete Answer: This is a sign that you need to visit your physician because the cause of these symptoms may not be immediately obvious. If you suspect the illness is due to a disease, including multiple sclerosis, consider taking a medical history along with a physical exam. You should also determine if there's a relationship between your symptoms and the severity of the illness. If so, you'll want to talk to your doctor to find out whether it might be possible to treat the condition.


Note: It usually takes at least four weeks before your symptoms resolve completely. However, sometimes you may experience only minor side effects, which disappear once your body has adjusted to the medication and diet changes.

Q. Where do my medications come from? \nComplete Answer: Prescription medicines must go through a rigorous quality control process involving independent laboratories and pharmacists to ensure the highest quality and safety standards. FDA requires that pharmaceutical companies conduct drug product trials where they test a new drug against its competitors. There are many different kinds of tests that occur during this process but the most important one is called preclinical testing. The company then compares the drug against a variety of reference products in order to make sure the drug really works well. Once approval of a new medicine becomes final, drugs are reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which evaluates safety and efficacy before making them available to patients.

For example, a cup of white rice has a glycemic index of 50, compared to a high-fiber cereal like brown rice which has only 25. But most people will find that the higher glycemic load of rice helps them lose weight by reducing their appetite. So we know the human body needs carbs as energy. However, is it possible for humans to digest these complex carbohydrates without getting the immediate results of an inflammatory response from our gut lining, known as anaphylaxis?

When asked this question, Dr. Fung replied: \[Yes]\n

It turns out that the human body makes proteins and other chemicals called peptides which help us digest complex carbohydrates. These compounds are called Peptide Gut Immunoglobulins (PGIs). PGI's bind to specific receptors in the gut lining and stimulate the release of anti-inflammatory substances, such as bile acids. By preventing inflammation while helping our body break down the complex carbohydrates, PGI's improve digestion. And at least in mice, studies show that PGI's may",22,my risk for developing type 2 diabetes,-0.4453526735305786,48,multimedqa,8,0.192,359,15

gpt2-xl_57,"Multiple sclerosis is a condition of the central nervous system that causes changes in vision, speech, balance, motor skills, and other functions. This is characterized by relapses or recurrences of symptoms (called attacks) that can last for months or even years. The disease may be progressive (become worse over time), but most people experience periods when it appears no more serious than any of those before.\r

What types of MS is there?

The different forms of MS are called primary (primary) MS, secondary (secondary) MS, and mixed MS. Primary and Secondary MS: These two types of MS have similar signs and symptoms, although they occur at slightly different times during the disease course. They both develop as damage builds up in nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. When this happens, the nerves begin to die off.

These two types of MS have similar signs and symptoms, although they occur at slightly different times during the disease course. They both develop as damage builds up in nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. When this happens, the nerves begin to die off. Mixed MS: A person with mixed MS experiences alternating periods of worsening and improvement. Symptoms vary widely from patient to patient, depending on factors such as age, gender, and family history. It's important to know that any one type of MS isn't better than another.

Is there an effective treatment?

No single drug has proven completely safe or effective for all cases of MS. However, several drugs work well in combination. These include:

Tysabri (Lamictal): Tysabri works to reduce inflammation and pain caused by MS by helping to increase blood flow to the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.

gpt2-xl_86,"This is not a specific disease, but an umbrella term used for more than 90 different diseases in the neurology field (more specifically known as the neurodegenerative disease field). The most important one here is MS. In most cases, it is caused by damage to myelin sheaths that surround nerve fibers in your brain. These herniated sheath fibers can be blocked with medications or through other medical conditions (such as Parkinson's disease) that make it harder for them to form properly.\pIf you have been diagnosed with MS (or any other neurological condition), please consult with your doctor so you know what to expect from treatment. A typical course of treatment will start with medication. Most often, these drugs will help reduce symptoms such as headaches and tiredness. Sometimes they may even improve the quality of life of people with this type of neurological illness. However, some doctors also prescribe supplements which can do similar things. In addition, there are many different types of therapies available for various types of MS including physical therapy, speech and occupational therapy, nutrition, exercise, massage, electrical stimulation, or surgery. You should never stop taking medication even if your symptoms seem worse or you see improvement on your own.\r

Question: What causes the inflammation of the spinal cord (spondylolisthesis)?\r

Answer: The inflammation of the spinal cord usually occurs because of an injury during childhood that results in the degeneration of a nerve root inside the spine. This may be caused by a blow to the head, or from a blow to the knee. Most often, the condition will have been present for several years before a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was made. However, sometimes multiple sclerosis is triggered by another brain disease such as Alzheimer's disease.\r

\r

\r

Question: Does an injection of corticosteroid drugs help cure multiple sclerosis?\r

Answer: A small dose of steroids called prednisone may help relieve symptoms in some patients who already suffer from the disorder. In fact, most doctors now consider prednisone to be one of the first treatments offered to treat MS. However, at this time, no treatment has proved to be more effective than placebo for reducing relapses. Your doctor may still prescribe certain types of anti-inflammatory medications after having done a trial of prednisone. It is important to note however that some doctors discourage using corticosteroids in people without previous MS experience, especially since the side effects can include dizziness, drowsiness, and weight gain.\r

\r

\r

Question: Can the multiple sclerosis virus trigger a relapse in those with MS?\r

Answer: There is evidence suggesting that the presence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the body may play a role in causing relapsing multiple sclerosis in people who do not have HIV. However, there is currently insufficient information to determine how frequently HIV infection might contribute to relapses.\r

gpt2-xl_79,"Yes. Multiple Sclerosis is not contagious like influenza or smallpox. If you have had it once, there's no reason to worry if you have another attack. However, if you do develop the disease again, your chances of passing it on increase because each subsequent case involves a new immune system and therefore more chance for infection. It's better to get tested every few years than never to know whether you have the disease at all.\nQuestion: What is my risk of heart disease when pregnant?\nAnswer: Your risk of having a baby with a heart defect increases during pregnancy, even though the mother has healthy genes. This is due to the hormones which accompany pregnancy that can cause the heart to grow abnormally in one part (the right side) while leaving the left side unaltered (i.e. normal). The resulting condition, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), is usually benign but sometimes requires surgery to correct. You're also much more likely to suffer an abnormal heartbeat during pregnancy, especially after delivery. So the best advice for both mother and child is to avoid smoking, drinking alcohol, and using drugs during pregnancy. Also, keep a close eye on how much exercise you do and drink during pregnancy. As well as this, avoid excess caffeine intake throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding. For information regarding DCM, visit the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists website \http://www.rcogc.org/heart_disease_causes.htm. Question: How long does it take me to recover from a concussion?\nAnswer: A concussion usually heals within 48 hours. Some people may need to stay home for several days. Keep yourself safe by taking steps to protect yourself against further concussions such as wearing protective headgear and avoiding certain situations where contact could occur. Do not drive after getting a concussion; avoid sitting or lying down for long periods, and use caution when playing sports. Ask your doctor what measures he recommends for your particular situation. Question: I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Is there any medication that will help me cope with my symptoms?\nAnswer: Although many people experience improvement with antidepressants, you might be able to benefit from alternative treatments such as yoga or meditation.

""Question: What causes diabetes? Complete Answer: Diabetes occurs when there is an imbalance between insulin (a hormone that moves glucose out of cells) and the sugar glucose available inside cells. This imbalance leads to high levels of blood glucose which can damage muscle and nerve tissue. When insulin levels become too high, they cause the body's cells to use stored sugar as fuel instead of burning fat. After too long without treatment, the diabetic develops serious complications resulting from high blood sugar and kidney failure.\r

""Question: What causes type 2 diabetes? Complete Answer: Type 2 diabetes results from an underlying problem with the pancreas that cannot effectively control insulin levels due to inflammation. Blood sugar levels rise until the liver makes more insulin and the problem is corrected. Some people also have certain genetic conditions causing them to secrete insulin poorly; this condition may prevent the liver from making enough insulin so that the blood sugar rises even higher than normal. There may also be problems in the kidneys.\r

""Question: What causes polycystic ovary syndrome? Complete Answer: Polycystic ovary syndrome is a disorder involving excessive production of male hormones and/or female hormones in women. These excess hormones result in irregular menstrual periods and increase risks of ovarian cancer. In addition, these excessive hormones disrupt the thyroid gland and affect the immune system. It is associated with infertility, breast enlargement, weight gain, acne and hair loss. Menopause can occur because estrogen levels remain high and testosterone levels decrease.\r

If you're outside or in a warm environment with plenty of time between exposure to heat sources your body may not feel as cold but if you're inside with little light available your temperature may increase slightly. Likewise, if you're exposed to extreme temperatures your body could react adversely and cause a high fever. You should always consult your doctor if you have any concerns regarding your temperature levels.\nQuestion: do I really need braces?\nComplete Answer: There isn't an absolute answer to this question because there are many factors to consider when deciding whether to wear braces. For instance, some people who choose to wear braces often report that their teeth are already straightening properly so they don't need braces anymore while others experience increased tooth decay after wearing them. Also, some studies suggest that patients who have orthodontic treatments (such as wisdom teeth extractions) show significant improvement in their gums and teeth. So if braces aren't necessary for you then try using braces in moderation.\nQuestion: why does my mouth feel numb\nComplete Answer: Many people experience numbness and tingling sensation in the face, upper jaw, and neck area due to several conditions including cancer chemotherapy treatment, dental surgery, radiation therapy, and other medical procedures. While these symptoms generally improve within one week after stopping the affected procedure, it's best to check up with your dentist before having a second appointment.\nQuestion: what are braces good for?\nComplete Answer: Well-fitted braces are essential for correcting posture problems such as poor breathing, forward head movement, and excessive drooling. In addition, most dentists recommend that children under 5 years old should only receive braces if they have been diagnosed with a serious oral infection. An infected oral cavity causes inflammation, infection, and swelling which leads to a buildup of bacteria in the mouth that eventually results in plaque buildup and eventual periodontal disease.\nQuestions: why do braces hurt?\n Complete Answer: Most adults",113,asthma and covid,-10.906518936157228,188,multimedqa,8,0.8584474885844748,392,10

Start in your own home first. For example, lie on your back, place one hand behind your head so that it points directly below your chin (figure 4), hold this position for 30 seconds, then slowly release that arm until it rests straight across your chest (Figure 5). Be sure to stretch both arms at least three times per day. The most important part of this stretching regimen is to be certain that each area has been properly stretched prior to any activity, such as exercising. When performing these stretching movements, always bend slightly inward, not out. In order to maintain proper alignment, take an extra 10 minutes after each session to rest your wrists on a bench or table. Always make sure your hands are warm before beginning the exercise. Do not perform this stretching routine while sleeping. Figure 4

The research team conducted a survey of 1,098 patients treated for lung cancer during 2012–2015. They found that 66% (1743/1922) of them did not receive any information about their future prognosis. The most frequent response was ""I do not know."" \r

Question: Do you have any tips for getting pregnant?\r

Answer: You do not need to worry about getting pregnant when using our products. We recommend that you avoid taking certain herbs while on a detox diet, including black cohosh, sage, thyme, valerian, and yohimbe. It is important to consume enough calories throughout your week to increase your body's production of estrogen. When you eat too many foods rich in estrogen, it can cause your blood serum level of estradiol (which makes your ovaries work) to drop below normal. This can result in early menopause, which increases your risk of breast cancer and also decreases your fertility. There are several other medications available on the market that can interfere with the hormones produced by the pituitary gland that help regulate ovarian function. These include some antihistamines and hormonal birth control pills. Please see www.fertilityclassroom.com/problems.html for more information.\r

As you know, many people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) suffer from excessive daytime abdominal bloating and frequent nighttime constipation. The symptoms can be relieved by a variety of dietary changes including decreased fiber intake, increased fluid intake, and dietary supplements such as fenugreek root, psyllium husk, or garlic. However, in order for these foods to work they must be consumed at the right time of day. During the evening hours when your digestive system is least efficient, you will have more difficulty digesting these foods than if you consume them during the morning hours before you go to bed. These foods may also cause weight gain. The best way to prevent this from happening is to eat your vegetables and fruits early in the day so that your digestive system is ready to perform its normal duties during the rest of the day. This is why it is important that you start eating your greens early in the day. If you do not get enough green veggies each day, then you could experience some of the same problems that IBS patients are having (such as excessive nighttime cramps). Fruits and fruit juices contain vitamins and minerals which can help relieve the intestinal discomfort caused by excess fiber. It has been found that people who regularly consume fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains tend to enjoy lower rates of obesity, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.\r

GLP-1 tells the liver to release glucose into cells so that they can use it for energy. In response to stress or illness, your body releases more GLP-1 which stimulates production of insulin in your pancreas.

What do I need to do if I am experiencing problems due to my autoimmune disease?\r

We've provided you with a list of questions to ask your doctor or healthcare provider. Remember that many doctors will be familiar with these questions already so they won't have to explain them. You may want to discuss any additional issues with your own healthcare professional. This includes taking medicines or nutritional supplements. It is important to make sure you understand which medications could interact with each other. Do not stop using medications without talking to your healthcare provider first. Certain medicines can increase how quickly your immune system attacks healthy cells. If this occurs it could lead to complications such as heart attack or stroke. \r

The following information is intended to educate consumers on the current understanding of autoimmune disorders by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). While we believe there is much more work needed before the ACR has definitive recommendations on what treatment options should be available to individuals, this information provides a basic overview on the condition. \r

An estimated 2.3 million Americans experience an autoimmune condition (1). These disorders include lupus, Sjögren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, scleroderma, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritic diseases, Crohn's disease, type 1 diabetes, ulcerative colitis, and Graves' disease. \r

Most people diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder have a positive family history. An autosomal dominant genetic predisposition contributes to approximately 65% of cases (2). People often develop their respective diseases due to exposure to environmental factors, including viruses, bacteria, parasites, tobacco smoke, stress, diet, obesity, drugs, alcohol abuse and even certain vaccines. Other possible contributing factors include infections, stress, poor nutrition, excessive alcohol",109,ehlers danlos syndrome POTS nausea stomach pain,-2.924347400665283,0,multimedqa,9,0.0,382,2

A diagnosis of MS can also have been made erroneously by certain health professionals such as physicians before they became fully knowledgeable in the disease process. In order to make accurate diagnoses more often than not it is advisable that a physician should examine and test every patient for infectious diseases. One way of testing for infections is through a blood test, and there are many types of blood tests available. If you are uncertain whether your blood sample has been contaminated then your doctor would ask you to take another blood specimen and send it for laboratory analysis.\r

Stage 1 - Stage 3 Cancer

The first step is to determine if you have a normal or elevated number on your mammogram (a scan that looks inside the breasts). If your mammogram shows an abnormal number (such as an overactive cell count), you need to get it checked by a doctor. Your mammogram results will also tell you whether you have any other symptoms such as a lump, pain, or tenderness, which indicate your cancer has returned.

Once you are diagnosed with stage 1 or 2 breast cancer, you must start getting treatment immediately. This could be surgery or radiation therapy. A woman who does not begin chemotherapy within 6 weeks after being diagnosed with breast cancer has an 88% chance of dying from it before she turns 60. Even if you start chemo before the 6 week mark, your risk of death remains high up until five years. The earlier you start, the better chances you have. However, women can still benefit from early detection. For example, if you are treated quickly enough you might live longer than someone whose disease has been going undetected.


If you are eligible for Medicare Part B or Medicaid and have access to an appointment within 14 days, you should schedule one.

Your doctor or nurse practitioner will review your results and discuss your options. They will want to know where you are in the disease course (the total amount of time since your last cancer checkup) and how long you've had breast cancer. If they do not think you're likely to die soon, then they'll give you a prognosis (how much time you have left to live). Doctors don't often discuss life expectancy estimates with patients because mortality rates vary widely among different types of cancers. But most doctors know that a survival rate above 80% is generally regarded as good and below 20%. In general, people with late stage (stage 3) breast cancer have a good chance of living a few months longer than those with early stage (stage 0) cancer. But this varies greatly between different countries, so your doctor might recommend a follow-up exam to make sure your cancer isn't spreading in other places in your body (metastases) or to monitor you for signs of distant metastasis (spread of cancer cells across the body).

gpt2-xl_77,"Menopause may be an early sign of multiple sclerosis (MS). Multiple sclerosis is the most common neurological disorder in women; it affects approximately 5% of all females at some point in their lives. MS typically progresses slowly over years until there is damage to the nerve cells that control movement and communication between muscles and brain. Damage to these areas causes muscle weakness, loss of vision, paralysis of certain parts of the body, numbness or tingling sensation, dizziness, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and other symptoms. The disease can affect any part of your body and cause pain, stiffness, fatigue, vision changes, hearing problems, memory impairment, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and joint pain, among others. In addition, you might experience abnormal swelling around the eyes and mouth as well as unexplained hair loss or itching. In addition, people who have had MS usually have a high risk for developing another type of neurodegenerative illness called Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) sometime during their lifetimes. This means that if you already have MS, you are more likely than not to develop LBD later on. There are several things that can increase your risk of having MS later on, including factors such as age, family history, smoking, alcohol use, obesity, physical activity, genetics, infection, diabetes, thyroid disease, exposure to chemicals, and stress.

Q: What is a 'biopsy'?

A: A biopsy is a surgical procedure used to remove tissue from inside your body. Most doctors will perform a biopsy only when they suspect a specific problem in your system—such as cancer. Your doctor will first ask you questions about your overall health, lifestyle habits, and general condition. They'll then give you information about what types of treatments and tests you're considering, which includes your blood work results. Then they will take a small piece of your tumor or lining cells by using a needle through your skin. During this process, bacteria are released into the area where you were removed. These organisms multiply and grow quickly within the tiny opening created in your skin. This creates an environment full of harmful germs. You're encouraged to wash your hands after being examined. If you don't wash your hands before or after your exam, you could spread germs that could infect your own or someone else's bloodstream. It's important to always wear a gown and gloves whenever handling your healthcare provider's instruments.

For example, a recent survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that nearly one in five adults (18%) had experienced an injury from a fall at some point during their lives; 16% were assaulted while sleeping and 11% suffered from depression. The United States has the highest rate of suicide among men in the world. In 1990, approximately 3,500 people committed suicide every day. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism estimates that more than 50 million individuals suffer from alcohol abuse or dependence. An estimated 19 percent of all U.S. households currently use illegal drugs. \nWhat happens when you eat too much food, drink too much water, or take certain medications? How does this affect your body? Complete Answer: Chronic overconsumption of food and water results in weight gain and obesity which causes many physical problems such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and hypertension, which in turn cause an increase in healthcare costs. A healthy diet consists primarily of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts. If we consume these foods in appropriate amounts, the incidence of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and hypertension will be reduced significantly. However, if we overeat or take certain types of prescription medications, it can result in serious consequences including diabetes, liver damage, heart attack, strokes, kidney failure, nerve damage, and death.\nHow can I reduce my risk of developing cancer?\nAnswer: Cancer occurs due to genetic mutations inherited from parents. These mutations occur randomly and so no two people with the same mutation will develop the exact same type of cancer. Approximately 30,000 new cases of cancers are diagnosed annually in the United States alone. Most cases are non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Certain kinds of cancers caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) are caused by HPV. These types of cancer are usually spread through sexual contact. Some strains of HPV also infect the mouth or throat and can cause genital warts, anal cancer, and cervical cancer.

gpt2-xl_35,"A ketogenic diet is not generally recommended as an option for individuals with type 2 diabetes due to the high fat content of most low carbohydrate foods (especially sugars). However, the ketogenic diet is still a viable alternative choice when attempting to control blood glucose levels after treatment has been successful or if the individual desires to achieve a healthy weight while adhering to the ketogenic diet. \NIn order to help you better understand what's behind ketosis, we created this video on how it works.\r

Keto Diet and Insulin Resistance in Type 1 Diabetes \u2014 The link above provides additional information regarding the benefits of ketosis in insulin resistant states such as type 1 diabetes; however, some of the key questions that were answered in the video below may be relevant to your own situation: What does ketosis mean? A normal state of ketosis occurs when there is a sufficient amount of dietary carbohydrates present within the bloodstream to provide for proper utilization by the body without excess glucose being produced. Ketones are produced when the body burns fat for energy instead of relying solely on glucose to fuel its metabolic functions. When the level of blood sugar remains constant during a period of starvation, there is a lack of stored glycogen within cells so the body can utilize fats directly as energy sources. This results in increased activity of several enzymes responsible for converting dietary carbohydrates into usable forms of energy including: beta amylase, alpha lipoprotein lipase, and succinyl CoA carboxylase, thereby allowing the production of acetyl coenzyme A which then is used as substrate to produce ATP through the Krebs cycle. In Type I diabetes, the pancreas produces little to no insulin and therefore must constantly regulate blood glucose levels. As a result, these patients have elevated fasting plasma glucose concentrations resulting in decreased availability of insulin-producing β cells to release the hormone into the circulation. This results in both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia at times throughout the day leading to further impairments in pancreatic function and ultimately, insulin resistance. As part of a comprehensive therapy plan, an oral medication called metformin should be administered daily to prevent further complications associated with the inability of the pancreas to properly secrete insulin.\r

A balanced diet will provide all essential nutrients, vitamins, minerals, fiber and protein so that you can feel full and satisfied. It's important not to overconsume calories because they can lead to fat gain, even if you don't overeat. Keep a food journal to track how many times you have eaten each day. Your daily meal goal should include at least 6 servings of fruits and vegetables. For every 2 1/2 hours awake during the day, aim to consume between 600-700 kcal from solid fats, such as olive oil, nuts, avocados and fish (choose fatty sources of omega-3s). Limit calories and add lean proteins such as chicken and turkey. Try to drink water throughout the day instead of soda, fruit juice and other sugary drinks. Drink plenty of nonalcoholic beverages, which contain electrolytes like potassium, magnesium and sodium. To lose weight, avoid processed meats, dairy products and high-fat snacks like potato chips, candy and ice cream.\nQuestion: what's the difference between eating healthy and having a healthy lifestyle?\nComplete Answer: Healthy means eating foods packed with nutrients that support good health.

But most diets are loaded with added sugars, fats, salt, saturated fats and refined carbohydrates. An American Heart Association study published in March 2009 found that when Americans were asked to report their dietary habits using seven criteria including how much sugar they consumed per day, just 16% reported eating less than 10 teaspoons of sugar daily.

""Answer: What is the best way to prevent osteoporosis?\nComplete Answer: Your best approach is to eat a well-balanced diet high in calcium, vitamin D, protein, and magnesium (3). If you are not getting enough nutrients, consider taking a multivitamin supplement containing vitamins A, C, E, and K, along with other minerals such as zinc and selenium. Other things to consider include not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly. Exercise helps maintain bone density by increasing fluid intake and reducing muscle wasting (4), which is why most people who have been exposed to trauma develop osteoporosis. Smoking has been shown to contribute to both short and long term bone loss (5), while obesity increases risk of fracture through its effect on calcium absorption and calcium metabolism (6)."" \r

""If you're looking for something specific, we will find what you want if you know the right keywords,"" she said.

In addition to direct support, Gaudet also points out that many people use the site to seek personal advice from physicians, dietitians, pharmacists, acupuncturists, podiatrists, chiropractors, massage therapists, nutritionist, and other healthcare providers.

Complete Answer: In many people who contract strep throat, there is only mild soreness in the upper part of their throats at first, but then develops into severe pain in the chest area. This type of strep throat symptom is called ""strep throat cough"" and can last several days or even up to three months. If left untreated, a chronic infection could develop within two to four years.\nQuestion: What's the difference between herpes zoster (shingles) and chickenpox (varicella)? Complete Answer: Both forms of varicella, like shingles, are viral infections caused by the same virus, varicella. While both forms of shingles can occur on its own or during an outbreak of chickenpox, shingles is more likely to lead to serious complications such as pneumonia. When chickenpox is triggered, it produces similar symptoms including high fevers, headache, muscle aches, itching of the eyes and mouth, swollen glands, swollen lymph nodes, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.\nQuestion: What is the name of the disease that causes appendicitis? Complete Answer: A complication of appendicitis is septicemia, which means infection of the blood vessels in the abdomen (intestinal tract). The bloodstream becomes inflamed, which makes it difficult for waste products produced in the liver to exit. Sepsis can result in shock, organ failure and death. \NQuestion: Why is having a cold so annoying?

2. What is the difference between science and medicine?


A. Both are scientific disciplines of human understanding. The word ""science"" refers to an institution that has formalized methods and procedures for gathering data and making predictions based on these data.


B. Medicine deals with the application of science in treating diseases. An example would be how to treat obesity through diet, exercise, or medication. A scientist might look at the body's fat cells, examine their structure and function, and identify changes in their physical characteristics as a result of eating, exercising, and/or taking medications. He may then determine which treatments will most likely work and recommend them to patients. This process is called clinical research. The results from such research can be published and used by physicians for treatment decisions. In contrast, medicine is a methodical discipline and often relies on evidence generated outside the laboratory. That evidence must be gathered by other scientists who do not specialize in this field. Scientific theories are developed based on observed data and theory; however, they cannot provide proof of what should happen next because no one knows exactly how an experiment will yield the desired outcome. Thus, a doctor does not have a right to act upon his own beliefs until he has been proven wrong. \fThe words, ""Science,"" ""Medical Science"", or ""Medicine"" refer to a specific branch of knowledge. Both science and medicine deal with the use of observation, experiments, and theory in studying biological processes. Scientists study the natural world through experiments performed using controlled laboratory conditions in order to gather information. Such observations are collected as part of observational studies. Experimental tests on living organisms are performed in order to better understand the mechanisms involved. These procedures are referred to as experimental sciences. Once basic principles of scientific inquiry have been established, experiments are designed to test hypotheses to further develop ideas in the scientific community. In doing so, scientists seek to learn more about nature and its workings.Scientists also apply science to human beings, attempting to discover ways of improving people's lives through",8,best apps daily activity exercise diabetes,-7.623032569885254,72,multimedqa,9,0.3050847457627119,424,8
gpt2-xl_63,"Yes - MS is one of the most disabling illnesses you can have and it can seriously impact your life for years or even decades. Your ability to work depends on your diagnosis, treatment, and safety precautions. The potential loss in income due to this disease is substantial. Some people choose not to be with their families because they fear that family members will suffer from it as well. If you don't know your diagnosis (MS is classified by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society), seek advice before seeking any kind of employment. Ask friends and neighbors if they've ever had symptoms or know someone who does. Look online for information about the risks of MS, including possible ways to avoid having an attack. Consider talking to your doctor so you can get appropriate test results. Question: Can I wear glasses while wearing contact lenses?\nAnswer: In general, contact lens wearers should not wear sunglasses when wearing contacts because they reduce vision to less than 20/80 or less than 100/200. Many people wear contacts with high prescription eyeglasses that do not cover all of the eye completely. This could result in blurred vision and decreased comfort or dexterity of the eyes. Contact lens wearers also need to ensure that the lens is properly fitted to their eye. For more information on proper fit, visit www.cdc.gov/lensimetry or call 1-800-LENS1. See \u201CHow do I check my prescription to see which lenses should go with my contacts?\u201D for details. Questions: Can I use sunscreen during my treatment?\nAnswer: It's best to apply sunblock only at least 30 minutes before going outside. Sunscreen products typically contain oxybenzone, which can cause allergic reactions in some individuals. When applied too often or under high levels of ultraviolet light, oxybenzone may lead to increased skin damage and inflammation. When applying sunscreen, reapply after each shower, bath, swimming pool dip, tanning bed session, outdoor activity, or other exposure to sunlight. Question: What type of treatment options exist to treat the nerve damage caused by multiple sclerosis?\nAnswer: There is no cure for MS but there are several treatments that can help manage symptoms and slow progression of the disease. They include steroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and anti-inflammatory drugs. Although these medications usually improve the symptoms of patients within a few weeks, the longer they're used the greater the risk of permanent disability.

However, if you have had MS for more than 5 years, then the risk of getting it again in the future increases. The risk factors include age, race/ethnicity, gender, immune system status, medications, and environmental exposures such as smoking, alcohol use, and sun exposure. In other words, many patients with MS can expect to experience recurrence at some point in their lives. As you might imagine, this could be difficult to live with. But remember, even if you do get MS again, you can prevent this by taking steps to protect yourself from further infection. And, there is good news... your body's natural defenses can help reduce or stop new infections.

Q. What's the best way to tell whether I'm allergic to something?\r

A. Here's one answer: Allergy testing. You may already know that most people react differently to different foods - some like honey, others like milk, and others still like eggs. While many doctors recommend allergy tests, most doctors haven't tested for allergies themselves. When they did, they found people who had positive results. And when they didn't test for themselves, they found no evidence of food allergies. That means all the negative tests for allergies aren't accurate - because sometimes you just can't tell which ones are true. So when you decide which tests are right for you, start by asking your doctor which tests he recommends. After all, the tests are usually provided free of charge. So the sooner you get started, the better off you'll be in terms of knowing what tests are needed. For example, if you have eczema, ask him if he suggests allergy tests (or if you think your skin might need special care).

Question: I am having my first MRI at the University Hospital Birmingham. What kind of X-ray equipment can I expect? What can we expect during the scan? Complete Answer: The most commonly used instrument in MRIs is called a Doppler, which uses sound waves to create images of blood flow around organs. This type of imaging has been shown to show changes in the amount of oxygen carried in the blood over short periods of time, and is very sensitive to small movements of tissues. The scan also shows the size and shape of the internal organs in different parts of the body. Typical images produced by Doppler are called T1 and T2; these allow for detailed examination of bone structure and the movement of muscles, nerves and bones in order to understand why an organ is affected. For more information see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_scanner


The latest version of the MRI technique is called a Diffusion Toolkit (DMT), which allows the scanner to produce images of tissue in three dimensions rather than two. These images offer greater detail and sensitivity in areas where tissue is thinning or thickening, allowing the doctor to clearly determine whether the area is damaged or healthy. As with all imaging tools, DMTs differ slightly depending on what part of the body is being examined. The DMT used in hospitals uses high quality ultrasound to view and",95,Reading problems in MS,-10.42503261566162,145,multimedqa,9,0.6872037914691943,403,10

Although UV rays may cause temporary damage or even burn a little area of skin, this only lasts until the body recovers enough to replace what was burned off. In addition, other factors that contribute to sunburn include smoking, improper use of sunscreen, unprotected tanning beds, indoor tanning lamps, and lack of regular exposure to the sun.\nQuestion: my brother and I were talking today and he asked me if i am afraid to die. i said ""yes"" because i'm scared that i might not be able to live as well as i want to\nQuestion: why do all those kids have such big heads?\r

\r

I see lots of kids with huge head size these days. What gives? \r

\r

There's no reason why children should be so large. It just looks weird to us. People used to grow up much smaller than they do now, so we didn't notice their gigantic heads then either. Nowadays they're growing taller because of genetics, so they must be growing bigger too.\r

\r

The answer to why a kid has a giant head doesn't lie in genes. They just happen to develop into adults with large heads as they age. I think the real explanation lies in our culture's obsession with physical perfection and its negative effects on child development.\r

\r

We teach our children that everyone else around them is more beautiful and more perfect than themselves. We tell them that they need to look perfect if they want to succeed.\r

Answer: Causes of fatigue in MS\n2\ There are several theories explaining how fatigue might develop in MS. For example, it may result from either a decreased production of neurotransmitters (such as dopamine and noradrenaline) or abnormal function of immune system cells.

While research suggests that these mechanisms may play a role, further research is needed.

Question: What should I eat if I'm trying to lose weight?\nComplete Answer: This depends on what you're trying to achieve. If you're looking to lose a couple pounds of water weight, choose low calorie foods like vegetables, whole grains, fruit, and lean meats with minimal added fats. You also need to watch portion sizes so you don't go over your daily recommended limit. Also, remember to keep an eye out for calories from unhealthy sources such as candy bars, soda pop, fried snacks, etc. The key to losing weight is to make small changes and stick with them. In other words, try not to diet too hard!

The bottom line: The best dietary advice you can give yourself is to eat a healthy diet. If you really want to drop some pounds and stay slim, it's probably better to focus on healthy choices than ""fat is bad"" messages.",22,my risk for developing type 2 diabetes,-11.044228553771973,222,multimedqa,9,0.888,229,3
gpt2-xl_68,"The causes of MS are unclear. It is believed that there are genetic predispositions, but it has not been proved conclusively. There is no cure for MS, but medications can help control the symptoms. Some people find relief by taking drugs called immunosuppressants (the same kind used to treat AIDS). In general, though, many people who have MS will benefit from the use of these medications. Some people with MS experience side effects. They may feel tired or run-down after treatment; others may lose their appetite. People with MS should consult their doctors before starting any new medication.

How often does your service need to be attended? What if I don't want my physician to call me?

Answer: Your doctor and nurse are required by law to contact you as soon as they have a good idea of what's wrong. You must also be informed if anything changes in your condition that requires additional testing or care, such as an infection, a worsening of symptoms, or a change in your health history. All patients are asked to sign a consent form at the time of appointment. This form confirms that you understand the nature of your care, and agree that this information is true and correct. See http://www.bluelibrary.org/lnc.htm#scc for details on how to read this document. If you do not give us your consent form, we cannot provide services to you. The only exception to this rule is when a patient is unable to speak for themselves during appointments. When the patient needs to make an appointment and cannot communicate in English or French, our office staff will fill out the consent forms for them.

What if I am being treated for another medical problem and don't understand the question I'm being asked? How can I ask questions without giving away sensitive information?

The best way to answer specific questions about your situation is to ask the appropriate person at your medical provider about the issue(s) in question. For example, if you are seeking an MRI for a headache, tell the doctor about your head injury and tell him you would like to be tested for MRSA. Ask if he could suggest other tests and treatments to treat your headache. Also ask about his knowledge of allergies and other conditions you might be concerned about.

gpt2-xl_86,"Secondary progressive MS (SMS) is a chronic disease that occurs after the body's immune system has been damaged by another disease or injury. The immune system attacks nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord, causing inflammation and paralysis. If left untreated, secondary progressive MS can lead to total disability. Primary progressive MS (PPMS) is an autoimmune process that results from damage to the nerve cells of the central nervous system caused by virus infection or radiation exposure. Although most people with primary progressive MS experience side effects such as fatigue, headaches, and muscle weakness, symptoms improve when medications are taken to reduce inflammation and inhibit the growth of new nerve cell tumors.

\rQuestions: Primary biliary cirrhosis\nAnswer: Primary biliary cirrhosis refers to three types of liver problems. Commonly called fatty liver, steatosis, and fibrosis, these conditions are all characterized by elevated levels of triglycerides (fatty substances produced by fat cells), low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and abnormal levels of apolipoproteins A1 and B. Fatty liver is more common among smokers than nonsmokers, although the cause isn't entirely clear. Steatosis is similar to fatty liver, but it affects other parts of the body. It may result in the accumulation of fat deposits around organs such as the kidneys, lungs, and pancreas. Fibrinogen, a protein found mainly in blood, also increases during fatty liver. Fibrosis describes the gradual buildup of scar tissue at sites of inflammation in the liver. This type of liver disease usually worsens over time because the scarring continues to build up even if treatment is stopped. \rQuestion: How do I know which medication is right for me?\nAnswer: There is no one correct medicine for every condition, so you should discuss your particular situation with a doctor who specializes in treating mental illness before taking any medication. Remember that a number of different drugs work together well in helping treat mental illnesses. Always consult a doctor before starting any new drug or changing a medication regimen.",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-0.0300940312445163,17,multimedqa,9,0.12781954887218044,330,6

""If you are experiencing severe headache pain or numbness over large areas of your body (i.e., you cannot feel your arms or legs), take advantage of medications called anticholinergics such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl). They are used to treat nausea and vomiting caused by certain types of infections. These medicines can make you drowsy and dizzy—and even temporarily slow down your heart rate. However, they will not stop your MS attacks; instead they will reduce your ability to feel pain, which means you won't notice when you are getting worse. Do not use them if you are already taking anything else to control your MS symptoms! Diphenhydramine will cause side effects like dry mouth, nausea, and diarrhea. It also increases your risk of seizures. Some people take high doses of Benadryl because it can relax muscles. But because of these risks, we don't recommend using this medication with children under 14. High doses of Benadryl can lead to serious side effects.\r

Answer: answer breast cancer\nAnswer: A woman who receives a mammogram will find out whether her breasts have been affected by tumors or benign changes. She can also be told if there are signs that she could develop breast cancer in the future. A breast cancer diagnosis requires careful follow up as well as careful screening of any new, enlarged breast lesions. A typical person has a 50% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. This means that if they were to get just one breast lump in their lifetime, they would almost certainly get breast cancer at some point. There are several types of breast cancers: ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), multifocal carcinoma in situ (MCSI) and invasive ductal carcinoma in situ (IDIS). Each type has different symptoms, treatments, prognosis and survival rates.\n Question: answer diabetes\nAnswer: Diabetes insipidus is when your blood sugar levels stay low for prolonged periods.

gpt2-xl_58,"The most common risk for developing MS is due to age, but there are other factors that can increase the risk of getting MS.\rQuestion: What is the cure for diabetes?\nComplete Answer: Diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) causes a malfunction in your body's ability to use sugar as an energy source and increases insulin resistance, which makes it harder to control blood sugar levels. When this happens, blood sugars become too high and can lead to blindness, kidney disease, heart attacks, strokes, nerve damage and even death.\rQuestion: How long does it take to lose weight after you stop smoking?\nComplete Answer: You will see dramatic results in just 10 days without drugs! It takes 4 weeks on average to start losing weight, however. This time period may vary depending upon how much nicotine and alcohol are consumed during the day. Smoking cigarettes releases toxins into the body that cause inflammation, metabolic changes and ultimately, a reduction in appetite. After quitting smoking, you must continue to watch your caloric intake, especially if you're going out to eat. You should also work with your physician to find ways to help manage the effects of physical activity and exercise.\rQuestion: Can my dog get diabetes from eating corn chips?\nComplete Answer: A small number of dogs and cats have been diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA occurs when glucose and ketones build up in the urine, causing symptoms similar to those of diabetic ketoacidosis, including lethargy, lack of coordination, pale gums, weakness and seizures. DKA is not commonly seen in humans.\rQuestion: Do I need insulin injection before running?\nComplete Answer: For many people, exercising vigorously and/or fasts for several hours prior to an event are the best way to ensure proper insulin delivery to muscles and nerves.

We recommend injecting only one per hour, every 20 minutes.

These include location (ovarian cancer occurs mostly on the left ovary), hormone receptors (the cells responsible for producing estrogen in women) present at earlier stages, and number of eggs produced by each ovary. Some studies show that ovarian cancer can progress more rapidly than other types of tumors, but most progress over the course of years. Most early treatments aim to reduce the amount of hormone being released and/or remove ovaries affected by the tumor (known as surgical removal). Certain medications are used to reduce the risk of additional side effects caused by the hormone therapy, while others help with bleeding and weight loss. For further information visit www.cancer.org or call 1 800 727 9888.\rQuestion: What is the standard treatment for breast cancer?\rAnswer: Treatment options vary depending on which type of breast cancer you have. However, most women will eventually need some form of physical therapy to reduce pain from their illness. Your doctor may also recommend surgery to address other symptoms of the disease, such as changes in your breasts, nipple discharge or enlargement. A mastectomy is one option, but a lumpectomy (removal of all the breast tissue) is more often needed. It is also possible to treat both breast cancer and its related conditions through certain drugs. For example, a drug called tamoxifen (brand name Nexium) is approved to help prevent postmenopausal breast cancer. Tamoxifen helps slow down tumor growth. Other drugs such as raloxifene (brand name Rocephin) can lower breast cancer's risk of spreading. While these drugs do not cure the disease, they may decrease the likelihood that it spreads to nearby lymph nodes. \rQuestion: How does my physician assess my chance of having other diseases?\rAnswer: It is important to understand what the potential risks and benefits might be associated with your particular situation.

Answer: Answer: Question: What is the difference between the symptoms of depression and bipolar disorder?\r

Answer: Complete Answer: Depression is a general term used to describe any depressive episode that lasts two weeks or more. People who suffer from a milder form of the condition may be referred to as ""mild depressives,"" while those with moderate or severe episodes may be called ""depressives."" Bipolar Disorder (sometimes also called manic depression) is characterized by recurrent periods of mania (or high mood), accompanied by hypomania (low mood). In addition, people experiencing this kind of manic/hypomanic illness can experience significant changes in eating, sleeping, and exercise habits. \r

Answer: Complete Answer: The cause(s) of both forms of depression are unknown. Depression can develop after an accident, trauma, or loss of a loved one. Although there is no cure for either form of depression, it is often treated successfully with antidepressants such as Prozac (fluoxetine), Wellbutrin (bupropion), Zoloft (paroxetine), or Paxil (paroxetine-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor). Other medications sometimes prescribed include antihistamines, nerve agents, antipsychotics, sleep aids, benzodiazepines, and muscle relaxants.[1] \r

Question: What is the difference between anxiety and panic attacks?\r

Answer: Complete Answer: Panic attacks occur when someone feels physically threatened, and their heart races, breathing becomes rapid, and they sweat uncontrollably. Anxiety occurs when you have a strong, unwanted feeling (such as fear or anxiety) that prevents you from doing things that make your life easier. While some people associate anxiety with something traumatic or frightening (e.g., the threat of being attacked by a terrorist), most people feel anxious only occasionally or rarely. Panic attacks and anxiety often go together because they represent different kinds of physical responses to stressful situations. Anxiety usually causes feelings of tension, uneasiness, worry, and nervousness in the body. These sensations tend to come on suddenly and abruptly in response to a situation that is out of control—a bad day at work, a big exam, or a conversation with a friend.

What to Do When Someone Tells You They Were Attacked By a Bear...

If you see a black bear in the wild, it may seem like it is just roaming around aimlessly until you decide to come up to greet it. However, bears rarely stop to eat or drink for long periods of time. It's entirely normal for them to stop frequently, especially on summer days when the sun is out and the air cools quickly. So while many people think of bears only as scavengers, the reality is that bears spend most of their lives searching for food and shelter. Bears may go off on a hunt as early as the first week of June, although there is no evidence to suggest that bears routinely make summer homes.\r

FDA approval of Medication Management Programs for Contraceptive Use in Women

Medication management programs provide convenient access to highly effective contraception through prescriptions only. These drugs are available to prevent pregnancy when prescribed by doctors and nurses who know how to use them safely. This program is designed to meet specific needs of medically underserved women in low-income communities in every region of the country. The FDA has taken steps to ensure women have easy access to this type of care without any cost sharing and has given manufacturers the authority to set their own prices, including co-payments, deductibles, and other out-of-pocket costs. The goal of the program is to reduce unintended pregnancies among women who might otherwise be unable to afford contraception.


In February 2006, the FDA approved three new generic versions of oral contraceptives based on improved safety profiles and lower initial out-of-pocket costs. They are now sold under brand names such as Plan B One Step, Next Choice One Dose, and Ella. In June 2008, Health Resources and Services Administration released two additional generic forms of levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), an injectable contraceptive approved in 2001 to prevent pregnancy and prevent ovarian cysts.

gpt2-xl_112,"Symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) include wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, or weakness in one arm or leg. \rQuestion: What is the most important aspect of lung function?\nAnswer: The most important aspect of lung function includes the ability to maintain air flow into the lungs at an adequate rate so as not to cause pulmonary edema (""fluid build up"") that can lead to life threatening complications such as pneumonia and death. Airflow occurs when oxygen is absorbed from the lungs through small cuts, holes, and pouches called bronchioles. Aerodynamic forces on inhaled carbon dioxide cause the lungs to expand by increasing their volume. This increases pressure inside the lung and reduces the amount of space available for gas exchange. As a result, a person's airway becomes constricted. This causes breathing difficulties and can lead to collapse and suffocation.\[This information has been taken from http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/specials/health/smoke_and_the_airways/index.htm ] \rQuestion: what are the basic steps involved in identifying a person who suffers from asthma?\nAnswer: Most people suffering from asthma have a chronic inflammatory process occurring inside their lungs. For example, some of these processes involve the formation of air sacs known as alveoli (also called ""lungpits""). These air sacs are filled with mucus, which contains substances including various gases such as nitrogen (N2), argon (O2), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). When this mucus gets too thick it blocks airflow into the lungs. The resulting respiratory failure leads to difficulty breathing, coughing, and even shortness of breath. \rQuestion: How does a physician identify asthma?\nAnswer: A physician will first perform a physical examination to rule out other diseases. Then he or she may order blood tests, x-rays, and/or echocardiograms (a special type of ultrasound scan that measures heart activity using sound waves), as well as other tests that help to determine whether the patient has any underlying health problems. Some patients may also be screened for allergies and drug use. \rQuestion: What should I do if my child has asthma?\nAnswer: First of all let me say that you must follow your pediatrician's advice regarding your children's diet, exercise routine, and medications.

gpt2-xl_83,"Multiple sclerosis is caused by an autoimmune disease which attacks the protective coating on your brain and spinal cord cells. A person with MS has two main types of lesions in his or her brain - demyelinating lesions and axonal and glial inflammation. Demyelinizing lesions affect nerves near the surface where there is no blood supply (arteries). Axonitis occurs when the white matter at the base of the spinal cord (the ""crown"") becomes inflamed and dies. Gliosis refers to abnormal growths in the tissues surrounding neurons or their dendrites (small branches that receive signals from nerve fibers). The hallmark feature of MS is how often it strikes children and young adults. It's estimated that 1 out of every 3 people over the age of 50 have MS. In contrast, most other diseases of aging - such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and even diabetes mellitus - strike less than 1 percent of those ages 65 and older. \r

There are three phases to the course of MS. First is the ""disease onset"" phase during which you develop symptoms of MS. You may also experience relapses of MS, but these occur infrequently. After this is the ""progression"" stage, which lasts for years. At some point after the progression period ends, your immune system begins to attack your own healthy nerve tissue. This leads to another stage, called the ""chronic phase"", which can last several decades. Finally, the ""resurrection phase"" occurs if the immune system finds its way back into the body through one of the many ways it spreads throughout the body. This can happen either because you were exposed to something that made your body become sensitized, like an infectious disease, or because you developed an autoimmune response to something you did during the chronic phase. When your immune system attacks your healthy nerves again, it's referred to as a ""recovery."" Your goal is to make sure you know what to expect during each stage so you can be ready to help others who are experiencing the same symptoms you are.

Ask the right questions. If someone asks you questions regarding your condition, do not ignore them. Remember that just because somebody doesn't understand how your treatment works, it doesn't mean they don't care! Asking questions allows us all to learn more about our health conditions and hopefully improve treatment options for ourselves and others. \r

A lymph node biopsy (also called a ""chemotherapy sample"") is an examination made of a small portion of blood from a lymph node. This sample can be examined by experts in order to determine if there are any abnormal cells present that could lead to cancer.\nThe results are usually not available for more than 3 years after the procedure, but may be available up to 12 months after the procedure. Also, it should always be discussed with your doctor prior to having any lymph node biopsies. If you have had a previous lymenotomy and have cancer in your chest wall or lungs, the result will vary based on whether you were given a lymph node biopsy and what kind of tumor was removed. If the results show cancer, then the next step would be radiation therapy to eradicate the cell(s) causing the problem. See our page on Radiation Therapy for More Information.

What does a mastectomy mean for my quality of life?


A mastectomy (meaning removal of the breast) is considered a major surgical operation where the patient's entire breast is removed. It can change a woman's lifestyle tremendously and cause many physical problems. For example, women who have had breast cancer before now do not know how to handle daily tasks as they must use crutches. Some have difficulties getting around without them. Others face other types of pain such as backaches and sleepiness. Some people find they cannot get intimate with their partner because they need to wear support stockings instead of high heels which make walking awkward for them. Mastectomies also cause an immense financial burden on society by placing huge amounts of hospital expenses upon each patient's insurance plan. Patients frequently experience postoperative complications, including urinary incontinence and bladder infections, that require long-term followup care.

If you work with both conditions at the same time, it is not recommended that you try to do so as you would be competing against other people for research grants.\nQuestion: What if I am trying to live without MS?\nAnswer: Your chances of living normally are better than ever before. Although we all know how debilitating MS can be, there are numerous ways in which you can overcome this condition. One way to help reduce your chance of developing MS is to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Smoking cessation alone may prevent up to 70% of new cases being diagnosed each year in the United States. You should also keep physically active by performing moderate exercise such as brisk walking three times per week or jogging 2 to 3 miles weekly. You should also continue taking medications prescribed for your condition. An important consideration when deciding on medication is whether you have an autoimmune disease (a disorder caused by a malfunctioning immune system). Some researchers think that some types of MS and other diseases triggered by infections may be influenced by genetic factors rather than environmental triggers. In addition, some scientists believe that certain types of treatments used by MS patients may be less effective than they otherwise might be because of the presence of antibodies called T cells, which attack healthy tissue but may become overactive in some people who suffer from MS. These T cells are known as immunoglobulin E type 1 (IgE) receptor-positive (IRP1).

Question: What is polymyositis?\nComplete Answer: Polymyositis is inflammation of many different joints in the body. The most commonly affected joint is the ankle joint (femur). Polymyositis affects approximately 2% of people over age 50 years who experience early onset osteoarthritis (OA) or OA/Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). People with this disease often develop arthritis within 1-3 years after a fracture of their first ankle bone. Polymyositis is caused by a protein called Mycobacterium avium complex. Other factors such as trauma to the knee or hip are also possible causes. Your doctor will likely ask you questions about other conditions, especially if they occur at the same time as polymyositis.


Question: Is it safe to use birth control pills during pregnancy?\nComplete Answer: Birth control pills are considered safe when taken correctly and properly. Some medications used to treat autoimmune diseases - including type I diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis - can pass through the placenta into breast milk. While there is no evidence that birth control pill usage affects breastfeeding, some women take birth control pills before nursing, which may affect breast milk supply. Therefore, it's best to avoid taking birth control pills while nursing. Women who haven't started breastfeeding yet should consult their healthcare provider prior to starting any form of hormonal birth control. Also note that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is not recommended during breastfeeding. Hormone replacement therapies - such as estrogen and progesterone - can interfere with milk production.


Question: What happens to me when my thyroid gland dies?\nComplete Answer: The thyroid is located below the throat and above the Adam's apple. It produces hormones needed for normal metabolism and growth. When the thyroid is removed, the only way to regulate our energy level is to eat foods containing iodine. Without proper iodine levels, your immune system can become weak and vulnerable to infection. During pregnancy, these iodine deficiencies can result in hypothyroidism, an underactive thyroid gland which means that the amount of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) produced is lower than normal.

gpt2-xl_1,"Chronic disease is one of the major challenges facing the human species today. The average life span of an individual in developed countries has risen from 40 years in 1900 to 80 years in 2010, but life expectancy continues to decline in developing nations due to preventable conditions such as obesity (which costs the U.S. $1 trillion annually) and increased mortality from infectious diseases (which cost the U.S. another billion dollars). Over the past century, research into how to effectively treat these illnesses has led to a number of breakthroughs that have improved quality of life for millions of people around the world. These advances have also contributed to global economic growth in recent decades by reducing the need for expensive health care. \rAnswer: One of the key reasons why we know so much more about the causes and symptoms of chronic diseases than they used to be is because they can now be diagnosed using simple laboratory tests.

gpt2-xl_105,"The wisdom teeth, or molars as they are known in English, are usually located on the back of your upper jaw near the front part of your mouth. They grow out from the temporal bone at the top of your skull, and then grow upward toward the floor of your mouth until reaching the roots. This process is called growth. The growth continues until the molar crown becomes large enough to accommodate the maxilla (the largest bone on each side of the face), and it will continue to grow upward after that until it reaches the soft palate by the time the child enters school age. For this reason, wisdom teeth can cause discomfort for some children during their first year of life. After the first year of life, however, wisdom teeth have almost completely stopped growing and begin to harden before entering into permanent biting positions.

What do you say? What information do you think people should be aware of prior to searching Google? I'm curious how you would suggest parents educate their kids about using Google and what to look up while online. Thanks!

Hi Michelle, Thank you so much for writing! Here are my thoughts: First off, google is great. It's a wonderful way to get quick access to information that might otherwise take hours to research. However, when I use it, I always wonder if there was a better alternative available. As a mother with an extremely young child who has never been exposed to any technology other than a tablet, I cannot imagine that she would know anything about looking for information. You said ""parents may also need to prepare themselves"" - I agree. If she had more exposure to these tools, maybe it could make her smarter and possibly create a different mindset in which she is able to ask questions without hesitating. As a general rule though, I'd recommend telling her that we all know things that no one else does and encourage her to learn new things that everyone else knows. When you're older, hopefully you'll come around to the same philosophy. Lastly, you mentioned ""common consumer search queries."" In addition to the ones listed above, I found that there were many ways to help children who are having difficulty understanding basic concepts like color and shape. One example that comes to mind is the concept of perspective. Sometimes, when thinking about objects in the world, our eyes don't really focus well on them; we see only half of the object at once.

\tAnswer: how to lose weight without starving yourself\nThis question asks if it is possible to lose weight while eating the same amount each day. People often think that they need to eat fewer calories per meal or snack so they can shed pounds, but this isn't always true. While losing weight may be easier when you reduce caloric intake at meals and snacks, the number of calories in your diet doesn't necessarily determine whether you'll lose weight. Even if you consume fewer calories overall, it won't matter very much if those calories come from foods high in fat or carbohydrates. If you're trying to shed a few pounds and you don't mind indulging in some comfort food, then it makes sense that the calorie count will also be lower. This type of nutrition advice has led many individuals to develop an unhealthy relationship with their diets because of fear over what they might be missing out on.\r

\tAnswer: why we should all drink more water\nWater is not only good for us physically and mentally, it's also one of the best remedies for dry mouth and thirst problems.

gpt2-xl_102,"You may have an allergic reaction or contact dermatitis if you come in contact with skin that has been exposed to too much of the substance called Propylene Glycol (PG). PG is used as a preservative, which means it keeps food fresh until it's opened. It also helps keep certain chemicals from reacting when they're mixed together during production processes such as making soft drinks. But when PG is accidentally spilled on your face, skin can become irritated or inflamed very quickly. PG is classified by the FDA as ""generally recognized as safe,"" meaning it doesn't cause cancer, birth defects, or other problems. However, PG will kill some bacteria that are harmful to humans. These toxins can be absorbed through the mouth, nose, eyes, and lungs. A few of these toxins include Formaldehyde, Dibutyl Phthalate (DBP), Trichloroethylene, Brominated Compounds, and Methylisothiazolinone. Inhaling large amounts of these toxic fumes over time can result in breathing trouble, lung irritation, skin irritations, headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, depression, memory loss, and more. Allergic reactions, such as swelling, itching, hives, and difficulty swallowing, can occur even after taking small amounts of PG for cosmetic purposes and can make you want to throw up or faint. The most important thing you need to know is not to use any product containing PG that contains propylene glycol, because it could damage your health.\r

gpt2-xl_8,"I am a doctor with over 40 years experience in the area of health care, so I have seen first-hand how technology is changing our lives for the better. In this interview, I want to share my personal experiences and insights into some of the most popular health questions asked today.


I will be taking your questions on several different topics relating to current health trends and the future of medicine. First up is diabetes. I see it as one of the biggest threats to human health. It has always been important to understand the causes of it, but many patients don't even know they have it. This leads to a lot of confusion among healthcare professionals, as well as the general public. However, in recent decades research has led us to realize that many of these symptoms can be treated successfully if diagnosed early enough. I'm hoping by sharing my personal experiences as a diabetic patient and using a combination of scientific research and stories from those who have lost their battles with the disease, we'll all learn more about what's going on inside of our bodies.


To kick things off I'm going to talk about some of the symptoms you may encounter when dealing with diabetes. Most people are familiar with high blood sugar (hyperglycemia), which is caused by too much glucose being absorbed by the body from food or certain medications like insulin. We also commonly associate diabetes with type 2, where there is too little glucose being absorbed by the body, usually because of lack of insulin production. Symptoms include: \u201ccolds,\u201d fatigue,\u201d shakiness,\u201d nausea,\u201d constipation,\u201d weight gain, and\u201clow energy levels\u201d


Next, let me discuss some of the ways in which diabetes affects the immune system. The most obvious way that diabetes affects our immune system is through decreased ability to fight off infection. Many types of infections cause inflammation of the body. High blood sugars can lead to an increase in oxidative stress, which means excess free radicals (more reactive molecules). Free radicals and other damaging molecules can damage cell membranes and DNA, leading to increased susceptibility to infection. Research shows that low levels of antioxidants help prevent autoimmune diseases. Unfortunately, very few studies have focused specifically on diabetes and antioxidant supplements, while others have used antioxidant supplementation in diabetic mice without any ill effects. Therefore, we only have limited information on whether using antioxidants in humans would result in improved immunity after treating diabetes. As a physician, I would encourage",8,best apps daily activity exercise diabetes,-12.429594039916992,167,multimedqa,10,0.7076271186440678,415,4
gpt2-xl_63,"Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system and causes progressive deterioration in motor skills such as walking or speaking (dysphasia). It can also cause vision problems, hearing loss, muscle weakness, depression, fatigue, and cognitive problems like forgetfulness or memory loss. People who have MS may experience numbness, tingling sensations, pain, stiffness, headaches, and mood swings. These symptoms are often referred to as ""motor"" symptoms. For this reason, it's important for people with MS to take regular breaks from activities they find too difficult to perform because of their neurological impairment. If you are interested in working in a healthcare setting, your doctor will discuss possible job restrictions and duties with you prior to hiring you. Most employers will allow you to work at home if you're able to get by on your own but some may require you to work during certain hours. Please note, however, that while there may be jobs available, you may not necessarily receive compensation equal to what you would earn if you worked full time at a standard office position. As you consider whether you want to work in a healthcare facility, please remember that most positions are part-time and do not provide financial security. You must make sure you have enough savings so that you could survive without support from a spouse, family members, or social services. Medical schools across America offer training programs to help prepare students to become physicians. Some schools even award academic credits for taking classes related to healthcare. In addition, many hospitals and clinics offer internship opportunities for young doctors. The ideal scenario for a medical student is to finish high school early and then go to college through the summer before receiving clinical training at one of these institutions. However, the best way for any individual to succeed in medicine is to obtain a bachelors degree (or more) in a relevant field or attend graduate school. Finally, if you don't already have one, consider becoming certified as a general practitioner or internist to train yourself to work as a medical technician and gain valuable hands-on experience at a hospital, clinic, or other healthcare facility. Although you won't always be able to practice medicine, your education will give you invaluable expertise in diagnosing and treating diseases of the body.


What type of education should I pursue after obtaining a bachelor's degree?

gpt2-xl_54,"Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease in which your immune system attacks the central nervous system (brain, spinal cord), causing damage to nerve cells that control movement. The destruction causes symptoms such as numbness or weakness, problems speaking, swallowing, walking, and more. A few of these symptoms can be severe enough to affect your daily life; others may not be serious but could lead to other complications.\rAnswer: For most people with MS, this condition affects only their brain and spinal cord, though there are cases where it can also affect the rest of the body. This is because your immune system can attack your own tissues, including muscles and bones. However, some people experience temporary paralysis while experiencing this type of MS. If you have been diagnosed with MS, you will need to discuss your options for treatment with your doctor. This includes medication options, as well as therapy that uses electrical stimulation to help strengthen nerves.\rAnswer: Multiple Sclerosis isn't an infection, so you don't need to worry about a bacterial infection spreading through your body. Most times, however, MS symptoms start slowly, and they usually improve over time. This progress depends on how much MS has attacked your brain and spinal cord, as well as what therapies you choose. You should know that medications used in MS treatments won't stop MS attacks altogether, but they can slow down progression and help alleviate pain.\rAnswer: One of the first things we do when someone has MS is take them to the emergency room for evaluation. Your health care team will give you information about your options for treating MS, as well as what they expect from you during your time at the hospital. They'll look after you until you're discharged home. In some areas, physicians will monitor you with blood tests to keep track of any changes in your health status, including worsening or new symptoms. But even if you never return to work, there's good news! Research shows that long-term MS patients who get appropriate treatment often have better quality of life than those who don't.

Mental health problems include depression and anxiety disorders. Depression is when someone feels sad or down; anxiety disorder is panic or agitation (including nervousness) in response to a perceived threat. People with depressive symptoms tend to be lonely and isolated, which may lead them to make risky decisions. They also have difficulty concentrating at work or school, may suffer from insomnia, and their sleep quality tends to worsen. It's important to note that mental health conditions do not cause physical illnesses like cancer or heart disease. The good news is that people with mental health conditions are much less likely than the general population to commit suicide.\r


People suffering from a variety of other mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, are particularly susceptible to certain types of abuse. These conditions increase the risk of suicide and suicide attempts, both among people with mental illness and those around them. According to CDC statistics, over 3 million adults in the United States will experience one or more forms of violence (physical, sexual, psychological, or financial) before age 65. A person with an underlying mental illness who has been abused is more likely to attempt suicide or kill themselves because they've lost control, experienced anger management issues, or had difficulties coping emotionally with everyday life.\r

""It's possible to treat both depression and substance abuse.""

What should I expect after getting help?

Getting proper treatment for mental health conditions takes commitment, energy, time, and patience. Even though mental health conditions can be extremely difficult to handle on their own, there are programs available to ensure you receive professional care while you go through the healing process. If you don't feel ready to seek out counseling yourself, support groups can provide information on what services are available and where to find them. Getting professional treatment is the first step toward recovering and living healthy lives. While it may take a little longer, recovery will pay off tremendously long term. In fact, research suggests that seeking treatment for mental health conditions significantly reduces your chances of committing suicide in the future.\r

Questions: what are some signs of Borderline Personality Disorder? Complete Answer: As noted in the ""What is borderline personality disorder?"" section above, people who suffer from borderline personality disorder often experience extreme emotional reactions to small losses, such as the loss of a loved one, money problems, financial troubles, disappointment, abandonment, rejection, criticism, criticism of others, negative attention, abuse, or ridicule. They may also react out of fear, especially if their feelings seem unreasonable and irrational. In other words, they are very sensitive to any sign that a person's emotional state or behavior may be unpredictable or unexpected. They may feel paranoid or overly cautious. Some people with BPD use drugs or alcohol because they feel safer doing so than being around other people. This may make them more vulnerable to having someone else take advantage of them and manipulate them into performing harmful acts. Other times, people with borderline personality disorder use substances because they have an intense need for love or acceptance. When this occurs, it is known as an addiction. \r

\r

Questions: What are the causes of borderline personality disorder? Complete Answer: Borderline personalities are born with these traits and may develop from birth through adolescence and adulthood. Most studies suggest that there are many genetic components to the disorder. However, environmental factors play a much larger role. For example, in families where a parent has bipolar I illness, children of affected parents tend to show higher rates of bipolar disorder. Another study found that women with borderline personality disorder were more likely to live with the father of their child before age 20 years old than non-BPD mothers; therefore, there was a strong chance that their child would become severely emotionally dependent on the older man. Therefore, while genes probably affect the overall risk, the impact of stressful life events, like divorce or abandonment, can increase that risk even further. It should also be mentioned that individuals who develop depression are also at greater risk for developing borderline personality disorder.

There is no clear answer on the treatment of relapses with MS, but it has been shown that there may be some benefit in reducing relapses by limiting MS activity during those periods of time when the disease symptoms appear. In other words, you can reduce your chances for having an exacerbation or relapse. This is especially true if you have severe MS at the onset of this condition. If you are not sure whether you should take steps to prevent further relapses, talk to your doctor. There is also much debate over the best way to control MS activity during these times. Some doctors recommend drugs called anti-MS therapy such as steroids or corticosteroids, while others feel that more natural ways to regulate MS activity (such as diet changes) may work better than medications. It may also be worth mentioning that many people with MS experience a relapse during their illness even though they are taking anti-MS medication. Although this could indicate that MS is simply causing them symptoms, some people believe that MS causes them relapses so that they can return to the course of drug treatments prescribed by their doctor. The problem here is that there are so many factors which affect each person's likelihood of having another flare up or exacerbation. Asking someone what they think may cause their relapses can only give us so much information, so we really shouldn't try to guess without knowing all the facts.\r

\r

Question: What is my age? \r

Answer:\r

The average age of people diagnosed with MS today is 58 years old, but the disease can strike anyone and people who have the disease for the first time can be just as likely to develop symptoms as people who have had MS since childhood. While most people diagnosed with MS will eventually make a full recovery, some people will not improve despite continued medication and treatment. That said, there are certain things that may help you get through this challenging period of life and avoid being left permanently disabled. It would be helpful to know how far along you are in the early stages of the disease before making any plans for long term care.\r

gpt2-xl_123,"Hypothyroidism is an autoimmune disease that causes the thyroid gland to produce too much of a hormone called thyroxine (T4). T4 normally goes into your bloodstream as a protein with a chemical name of triiodothyronine (T3). But when it's not absorbed in your body by your kidneys, you have a condition known as hyperthyroidism, which can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, depression, muscle aches, and tremors. \nQuestion: how do I know if my doctor has hypothyroidism?\nAnswer: This is one of the most frequently asked questions by consumers searching for doctors who will diagnose them for hypothyroidism or other issues related to this disorder. There aren't many definitive tests to determine if your doctor has hypothyroidism; however, there are several ways to assess the amount of thyroid hormone being produced by your thyroid gland at any given time. These include: * Checking the levels of TSH - Thyroxine stimulation test (TSH)

* Checking the amount of free thyroxine (FTO) - Free thyroxine (FT), which is more easily measured than TSH, is usually higher than normal in people with hypothyroidism. However, the amount of FTO in response to a specific amount of TSH often fluctuates between healthy ranges. Therefore, the best way to get a good understanding of the amounts of thyroid hormones being produced from your thyroid gland depends on what type of thyroid function testing you are having done. * Using a simple saliva sample to measure the amount of TPO-cholesterol (the ""good"" cholesterol in your blood)

* Using a blood sample to detect small amounts of thyroid hormone called levothyroxine - A blood sample should be taken 1 hour after eating breakfast and again 2 hours later, and then 4 days later. You may need to take additional tests over time for longer periods of time. It's very important to note that some tests like the FTO test don't always give accurate results because they can vary depending on how much FTO is in the blood sample, as well as the patient's age and health status. For example, if you're younger than 50 years old, you'll likely see a high rate of FTO in your blood sample (if you've had a diagnosis of Graves' Disease in the past, or if you've recently been diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease).

Most recently, researchers at Washington State University have found that taking a dietary supplement called green coffee extract (GCE) helped alleviate symptoms associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). GCE has been shown to be effective in increasing cognitive abilities in children with ADHD who had not responded to other treatments. The research team also discovered that it can reduce cortisol levels in the body which may help improve sleep quality. GCE is sold as a supplement but may be available under other names.\r

The American Psychiatric Association says that while many medications used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder include some form of stimulant ingredient (e.g., amphetamine), there isn't any evidence that these medications are better than placebos in treating this disorder. A recent review published in the International Journal of Clinical Practice said that placebos alone don't seem to be effective at improving overall outcomes among patients diagnosed with ADHD.\r

ADHD is a behavioral problem that causes problems in your daily life such as failing to finish homework, falling asleep too quickly, or being easily distracted. Some children experience symptoms during infancy or childhood, whereas others develop them later in life. Most adults with ADHD find that the symptoms often begin around age 10-12 years old.\r

Symptoms in Adults

The signs and symptoms of ADHD vary from person to person. For example, one adult might get to school or work after spending two hours getting ready, and another would get stuck behind schedule-makers with their own personal time management issues. Symptoms usually start to improve once you manage your ADHD behavior and set goals to stay productive throughout the day.\r

gpt2-xl_92,"In recent years research has shown that there is a clear correlation between the prevalence of fatigue and cognitive function on a given day, particularly when measured as an index of cognitive load (the more difficult a task or task set is, the lower its level of cognitive load). Studies have also shown that individuals with higher levels of physical activity also tend to report less fatigue and better performance on mental tasks over time. The link between cognitive ability and fatigue is not absolute but rather reflects the fact that people who perform at higher cognitive skill levels tend to be able to manage their mental workload and tolerate greater levels of physical stress than those who do not. It seems likely that this link will become increasingly important as the world population ages and becomes progressively healthier. The impact of aging in general can create significant changes in both daily life and work environments and it should be possible for people to adapt and adjust their working practices to accommodate new conditions that arise as they age. For example, the effects of cognitive decline may lead to increased demands on older workers to maintain proficiency in specific cognitive tasks. As such, some job functions might require increasing levels of attention and coordination, which could translate into increased fatigue if performed alone. This type of adaptation would only result in increased risks of injury, so it would be prudent for employers to continue monitoring employees' fatigue throughout the course of their careers. If necessary, interventions could be implemented, including providing training, making adjustments to working schedules, or limiting certain types of work assignments. These adaptations would all improve productivity while reducing costs.

However, both genders have an increased risk if they smoke or consume alcohol.\ nQuestion: My risk for developing high blood pressure\nAnswer: You have a higher risk for developing hypertension if you're obese and/or heavy smoker. Women are at a lower risk for developing hypertension than men; however, women who've had gestational diabetes may be more vulnerable to developing hypertension. In addition, being overweight or obese increases your risk of developing hypertension by up to 25%. \nQuestion: Can I lose weight without losing muscle?\

Answer: No. Weight loss can cause changes in muscle, including decreases in strength, size, and ability to perform activities of daily living. Some people do achieve a permanent reduction in body fat percentage, but it takes time and requires consistent effort over a long period of time. People who want to become lighter should start with healthy diet and exercise practices first.

A condition where nerve cells within the brain are damaged so severely that it results in loss or paralysis of parts of the body such as muscles, eyesight and speech. It is caused by damage to one part of the immune system called T-cells (Thymocytes). \nQuestion: What is the difference between secondary and primary progressive MS? Complete Answer: Primary progressive MS is a form of MS which occurs when the immune system attack the central nervous system first; the only symptoms are those of weakness, muscle atrophy and fatigue. The disease progresses from there and often leads to blindness and eventually death. Secondary progressive MS is less severe than primary progressive MS, but can result in vision loss, paralysis, deafness and other signs.

However, obesity has a number of risk factors for both diseases. Obesity increases the risk of stroke, which causes memory loss; diabetes, which leads to diabetes complications; and osteoporosis, which can lead to bone fractures. Another concern related to Alzheimer's disease involves memory loss. Many people have a natural tendency to get tired before they start to lose their memories, so it's good to take advantage of this phenomenon.

Question: What is Multiple Sclerosis?\nComplete Answer: Multiple Sclerosis is the name given to a group of neurological disorders that affect the central nervous system (CNS) that affects 1% of all Americans between ages 18 and 64. The most commonly affected areas include the brain, spinal cord, optic nerves (eyes), arms/legs, hands, feet, and legs. In addition to these CNS abnormalities, MS patients experience pain throughout their bodies as well as cognitive impairments, memory loss, social withdrawal, inability to control muscles or speech, headaches, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, depression, nausea, vomiting, and poor concentration. Some people with MS even report feeling trapped inside their own body with a constant sensation of ""being out of place"". Other people don't feel any type of neurological symptoms whatsoever, but still need medication because they cannot walk without assistance; they must wear special shoes to get around, take medicine twice daily to manage their condition, and even change medications every few months when their condition worsens.\r

Q: Is MS hereditary?\r

Answer: No, MS isn't inherited in its traditional sense; instead, it's due to a combination of factors such as environmental exposure, genetics, and viral infections. This means that, although there is some similarity between people that cause MS and people that don't, there are many different ways to inherit MS including both genetic (DNA) and environmental exposures. A number of genes play a role in causing MS. These genes could be passed down from parent to offspring through each generation. There are two main types of gene mutations that lead to MS which are known as autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive.\r

When you feel tightness in your neck or shoulders, it is often a result of improper posture or muscular imbalance. As mentioned earlier, the key to proper movement and comfort is a well-balanced body. Proper muscle balance allows for optimal flexibility, strength and endurance as well as optimal performance within the athletic and martial arts environments. A simple stretch such as the side plank can help to relax all areas of your body, including the head, neck, back, arms, hands and wrists. The most effective way to do this exercise correctly will be shown below: Stand with your feet hip width apart, palms facing each other. Lift one foot off the ground so that it is placed just under your buttock. Hold on tightly by squeezing both shoulders together and lifting your other leg up so that it rests on your opposite knee. Slowly lower your upper arm until it touches the floor before slowly raising your arm again. Repeat for the other foot. To perform the same stretching exercises but for your shoulders instead, stand with your feet at about shoulder width distance from an edge of the gym bench. Place your right hand on the bench and position yourself over it with your left elbow bent 90 degrees, palm toward the ceiling (like a triangle). Keep your eyes directly ahead and close your mouth slightly. Keeping a straight line between your fingertips, slide your thumb over the top of your right index finger. Lean forward until your chest pushes against your left thigh, keeping your chest level. Continue tilting your body left while pulling your thumb down toward the floor. Return to starting position by leaning forward and placing your left elbow on the bench. Rest for 30 seconds. Switch sides. Repeat for both sides for a total of five sets of 15 repetitions per side.\nQuestion: How should I eat?\nComplete Answer: Eat enough protein to meet your daily calorie requirements and avoid any foods high in saturated fat, sugar or salt.

gpt2-xl_101,"\nA lot of people with an enlarged lymph node will experience some degree of pain when the lymph nodes swell. This is usually due to overproduction of certain immune system cells (called eosinophils), which produce substances that cause pain or irritation. The discomfort is typically worse at night because these cells secrete more substance than in the daytime. When the situation becomes chronic, patients may have persistent symptoms throughout their lives and sometimes even die from this condition.\r

This symptom can be caused by many factors including radiation therapy for cancer treatment, chemotherapy drugs, parasitic infections, and other diseases. If you suspect your patient has had excessive lymph node enlargement caused by heavy chemotherapy treatments, then it may be time to consider having them stop using those medicines while they try to minimize their overall exposure. Even though there is no reason why chemotherapy should not be used effectively, most patients do not feel well after taking medication for several months or years. In such cases, a careful examination and evaluation of their lifestyle may allow the doctor to determine if other options are available and more effective than conventional chemotherapies. For example, some doctors recommend that patients undergo regular exercise programs to strengthen their bones as it helps prevent osteoporosis and fractures. They also urge that patients get more sleep, avoid alcohol, cigarettes, and caffeine, all of which increase levels of cortisol in the body. These medications may help relieve inflammation associated with tumors and other conditions. However, even if you cannot eliminate or significantly reduce the use of traditional chemotherapies, lifestyle changes can still provide some relief for patients. \r

What we want to know is: What can I tell my patients about cancer? Complete Answer: Cancer is a complex disease whose causes remain unknown, so there are currently no specific cures. While our current understanding suggests that cancer originates in different parts of the body, there is no evidence to suggest that cancers are contagious. There are many things that you can do to lower your risk of developing cancer. You can take steps now to lower your lifetime cancer risk by eating healthy foods, getting enough physical activity, limiting tobacco use, being physically active, and preventing illness through proper nutrition and rest. \r

The most important ones for your understanding are: carbon (carbon), hydrogen (oxygen) and oxygen (oxygen).\nAnswer: What is genetics?\nComplete Answer: Genetic information can be found in all living things in the form of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) which contains genes (the instructions) for making proteins (enzymes). These chemicals are constantly being made by certain genes in our bodies, but sometimes these enzymes fail to do what they are supposed to do. This results in a genetic disease. This type of genetic problem causes the body to produce extra copies of some genes, thus increasing the chance that one would become active. In other cases the gene might not cause any problems at all. Genetics may also give us clues as to how we got here on earth and how to get out.\nAnswer: What is nutrition?\nComplete Answer: Nutrition refers to the process of extracting the energy from foods such as foodstuffs and eating it to sustain life. Nutritional requirements vary depending on age, gender, activity level and metabolic rate. Food should include essential nutrients (carbs, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals and water) in order to meet those needs. Some foods provide more than others, and some contain combinations of different types of food. Foods must be digested and absorbed before usable energy is released into the bloodstream. Many of the foods consumed by humans will naturally contribute to the production of energy in the human body. These include starch, protein, sugars, fats, fibre, alcohol and caffeine. Other dietary components, known as toxicants, have been shown to affect metabolism in undesirable ways, causing unwanted weight gain or even death if eaten in large amounts.\nAnswer: What is science?\nComplete Answer: Science is the study of nature.

\rThe most common chronic diarrhea is caused by the Clostridium difficile bacteria. Symptoms include severe diarrhea that lasts for 6-8 weeks or longer. This causes anemia, weight loss, and fever. The infection can be treated with antibiotics and supportive care. People who have had the infection more than 4 times should see their doctor immediately.\r


There are many reasons why someone could become seriously ill from C. difficile. These include poor immune system response, infections, taking certain medications, stress, malnutrition, and other illnesses. Chronic diarrhea may also occur in otherwise healthy people when they take certain medications. Some of these medications include:\r

\nQuestion: chronic diarrhea long term memory burning pain nausea vomiting abdominal pain \n Complete Answer: \r

\rIn some cases of C. difficile infection, symptoms last for years after treatment has been completed. It's important to ask your healthcare provider if you're continuing to experience any problems with your GI tract.


Some people have a serious reaction to one type of antibiotic, such as erythromycin. If this happens to you, stop taking it and see your doctor right away. Other people need to continue taking multiple types of antibiotics because they've already developed resistance to them. Because of this problem, the CDC recommends using only two different antibiotics at a time during treatment for C. difficile infection. However, doctors often recommend treating patients who have diarrhea for several days, even months, with three different types of antibiotics. Doctors don't always know which antibiotic will work best.\r

As we age, we become more likely to use medications that interact with each other. This can lead to higher readings than usual or even dangerous levels. For example, using medicines that contain aspirin may cause your blood sugar level to rise faster, causing hypoglycemia. When this happens, keep taking all medications as directed by your doctor. Your care team understands how medications work together and adjusts your dosage to get the best results from each. Ask your care team what they recommend. Always ask the same questions over and over again so you know exactly what to expect. Question: How do I tell which drug company owns each one of my medicines?\nComplete Answer: All of the drugs in your medicine cabinet are manufactured by pharmaceutical companies. Each company produces several different kinds of products, often in combination with each other. There are hundreds of different drugs available through pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) who manage your prescriptions, fill them automatically and bill you based on a percentage of their sales. However, there are certain things you should watch out for before buying any medication. Make sure the name of the manufacturer, the brand name and whether the drug is approved by a regulatory authority such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). To find out which PBMs control which brands of drugs, call your local pharmacists office. They also offer drug information service numbers.

Q: When you were first diagnosed with MS, did you know exactly how severe your illness was or was it more like a vague sense?\nA: No. It wasn't until about six months ago when I got this diagnosis that I started having symptoms of it again. The only symptoms that came back are just fatigue and general aches and pains that I don't really have much control over but if they're severe enough then it does take away your ability to do things. So for me it's not so much about knowing what's going on, I'm pretty sure I didn't know at all. As far as the severity of the disease I can say that it is very slow progressing, it doesn't feel like someone has been beating up on your body and breaking down every single one of your bones right now, but I've been saying for quite awhile now that I'll probably never walk normally again, I haven't even walked without pain since January.

gpt2-xl_77,"Menopausal symptoms are associated with the onset of MS as women age. Women who become symptomatic during the menopause may have a greater risk for developing MS in later life. The incidence of MS is not known; however, because women are at an increased risk of MS than men, MS and other autoimmune diseases (such as lupus) that affect the joints may be more common among women who become ill in late middle age or early old age. For example, MS occurs significantly more often in young women. This makes sense considering the fact that it is thought that MS develops from inflammation in the body's own immune system, which becomes chronic when cells begin to die off. Although the cause remains unknown, it seems likely that MS affects some aspects of the brain in men and women differently.

Q: What causes premenstrual syndrome?\nA: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS), also called pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), is commonly referred to as ""the menses blues,"" but has many different meanings depending on what you mean by it. In most cases, PMS is defined as a period between menstruation and ovulation. While there may be several reasons why a woman may experience this phenomenon, its most recognized symptom is mood swings such as sadness, irritability, anger and depression. It can last up to two weeks per cycle. Other symptoms include headaches, breast tenderness, fatigue, abdominal pain, bloating, and vaginal discharge. If left untreated, PMS can lead to anxiety, depression, eating disorders, substance abuse, menstrual problems, infertility, premenstrual fatigue, loss of sex drive, changes in appetite, decreased interest in work or school, and weight gain. Although these symptoms generally improve after stopping treatment with certain medications used to treat PMS, they should always be checked out if your doctor suspects that you might be experiencing one of them. As far as how these symptoms relate to MS, it is unclear exactly how and why they develop. However, as we move closer to understanding the mechanism of how MS starts, scientists will be able to figure out how and why these conditions happen so quickly and then stop. For now, researchers believe that the reason why people are affected by both PMS and MS may involve hormones released from the endometrium. There is evidence suggesting that the hormones melatonin and estrogen play important roles in regulating the function of the brain and nervous system. Research suggests that melatonin helps regulate the production of serotonin, while estrogen helps",77,How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?,-0.0188959725201129,0,q,1,0.0,410,18

Q: What can be done about braces? A: There are some things that can help prevent them from falling out in the first place (see below). They should be replaced every three years or as directed by your dentist. If they fall off during a visit, ask for a reminder. Some dentists will also do this procedure at home, although sometimes this isn't practical. You'll need to see a professional who specializes in keeping them on properly and repairing any damage caused by wear.


You may experience other problems like arthritis from wearing braces. But most people don't notice anything wrong until they start getting teeth pulled out. It's best not to worry too much about these types of issues though.

It's possible to replace braces yourself, but this isn't something that most people would consider unless there was serious damage. When they were installed, braces were usually made of metal, so they have lots of potential for causing health concerns over time. In fact, one study found that when you use steel braces for more than 10 years, the metals can be absorbed into the body in ways that cause liver disease, heart disease, kidney failure and nerve-damage. Even after you get rid of the rest of your dentures, they could still affect your bones. So, there's a good reason to never let anyone try to fit new ones without consulting a professional first. Most dentists require two full set of replacements before they'll even give you a call!

The National Workers' Compensation Board (NWCB)

I've been a lawyer for 30 years now and I've handled numerous workplace injury cases. The NWCB does what is required under the law in regards to disability insurance and claims. It's important to know that there are two different levels of coverage and each has its own requirements. This can be confusing because the regulations vary from company to company and there aren't any clear instructions on exactly which employees should be covered. In fact, there isn't even clear guidance on who should qualify as a disabled worker or what compensation they should receive if injured.

The first level of protection for employees is called ""employee"" and consists of health, medical, and life insurance. There is also a certain amount of liability coverage. Under this plan, if someone causes a death while working, their employer is legally responsible for paying the deceased's estate a sum equal to 100 percent of the insured person's salary, plus any benefits they received over the period of the insured person's employment. If the accident was caused by the insured person and was the result of gross negligence, then the liability policy pays the legal fees for the victim's family and attorney. So if a driver injures another motorist while texting, they would have to pay the victim's family $1 million plus an additional $500,000 to cover any damage to property. On top of that, the victim's family gets to keep any money that is left after these costs are paid. When you combine this with the limited amounts of workers comp insurance available, it is very expensive for employers to pay for such a claim. Also, if an employee is unable to work due to a condition affecting his or her ability to walk or work properly, they may still get workers comp insurance, but only if the employer has made the decision beforehand.

As far as determining whether a worker should be entitled to workers comp, it depends on three things: (a) whether the employee suffered a physical impairment; (b) the extent of the physical impairment; and (c) the degree of carelessness shown by the employer.

A ketogenic diet is the recommended way to manage Type 1 diabetes in adults and children with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes, but it can be used by anyone who has diabetes regardless of their glucose level or insulin requirement. It is also safe for those with diabetic kidney disease.

Ketosis: What Is The Benefit Of Ketones For Diabetes? Ketone bodies are produced during fasting (or if you're eating low carb) as your body breaks down fat stores so that more energy can enter your cells and muscles. Since there's not much sugar circulating in our blood at this time, we use up some glucose reserves as fuel. Once all of the glucose has been metabolized, however, we need to get rid of any excess glycogen (stored carbohydrate) because there isn't enough available to power us through our day. However, since the liver will try to store any glucose you have stored, we don't want to burn off too many calories. By burning fat instead, we'll release ketones into our bloodstream which, according to the National Institutes of Health's ""Diabetes Prevention Program"" report, ""will boost energy levels, help control weight gain, and reduce inflammation."" In fact, Dr. John McDougall recommends using an oral glucose tolerance test after four weeks of using ketosis in his book ""The China Study,"" which showed that the improved health and decreased risk of heart disease were the result of the ketones and not the reduction of carbohydrates. You may hear claims that ketones cause headaches and nausea in diabetics; however, studies show that these symptoms disappear once they've gone away on their own. When ketones are elevated in the blood, there are two primary ways in which they contribute to improving one's health: Reducing insulin sensitivity – As discussed above, increasing ketones helps increase insulin sensitivity and therefore reduces blood glucose levels. Therefore, reducing or eliminating sugars from our diets could potentially lower our chances of developing high blood pressure, type II diabetes, stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, cancer, arthritis, fibromyalgia, arthritis pain, muscle cramps, joint stiffness, sleep disorders, brain fog, memory loss, lack of concentration, and mood swings.

The second group of studies focused on muscle training. The focus was not just on strengthening muscles, but also on learning how to modify them so they do what you want them to. This is a major aspect of weight training that many people don't know about.

For example, if you're interested in gaining size and strength, there are several different methods you can use (for example, single-joint movements and compound movements). For each method, you have to develop an understanding of the body's structure, as well as its function. When we train for strength and muscle mass, we're essentially trying to change how our bodies make decisions with regards to moving through space, which ultimately affects the way our muscles work. We need to be able to learn how these systems operate and adapt to new situations before doing anything more advanced.

These two types of studies were very important because they taught us a lot of things. One thing I found surprising was how much people changed their behavior after working out—not only physically, but mentally and emotionally too. They started seeing themselves differently, as well as other people. It seemed like exercise changed how people viewed themselves in all sorts of ways.

One study involved studying some men and women who had been obese prior to starting the program. What happened? Over three weeks, they were asked questions such as ""How often do you think your life will get better or worse?"" and ""Are you satisfied with yourself right now?"" After three weeks, their answer to both questions dropped by around 30 percent. In fact, when asked this question again after 12 months, only one in four participants reported being unhappy with their lives. That means they felt happier and more positive than they ever had previously, something unheard of in most studies of how exercise affected health and wellbeing. And it didn't stop at self-image; they actually saw increased productivity throughout their entire company!

Another interesting study looked at how long it took people to feel better. It compared obese individuals who had lost 10 pounds at the beginning of the study to those who hadn't done anything before. Those who did the extra workouts ended up feeling significantly better within six days, whereas those who didn't got back into shape faster—meaning the initial workout gave them a boost. So, rather than losing fat, these people were creating muscle.

gpt2-xl_94,"You need to know that MS is a progressive disease and you should be monitored by your doctor. The best way to monitor if the disease is progressing or not is to do daily exercise. Your doctor may recommend that you begin running as soon as possible. Some people experience improvement in their symptoms after just a few weeks of running, while others continue to have some degree of disability for months or even years after starting to run. Even when symptoms improve, they can recur at any time, so it is important to make sure you are getting sufficient sleep, eating healthy foods and avoiding tobacco, alcohol and drugs. It also helps to maintain an active lifestyle (such as walking) and keep up with other activities such as gardening or gardening classes, which can help reduce stress. A person who is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis may want to consider participating in a research study aimed at finding new treatments for this debilitating condition. This type of study involves taking part in an experimental treatment known as immunotherapy. These studies take place in different countries around the world, but most often involve small groups of patients who have already been diagnosed with MS, and then follow them over time until they have completed the treatment. These trials test out the effectiveness of immunotherapies on patients with relapsing-remitting MS, also referred to as RRMS. You may also be eligible for a clinical trial of immune therapy called exenatide, if you have received one of the previous three drugs used to treat MS. This drug works by targeting the body's own T-cells (immune system cells), and has already shown promising results in animal tests. In addition to completing your MS checkup, it is always good practice to discuss your health and medical history with your doctor. Although the risk of adverse side effects from vaccines like MMR, varicella and tetanus remains low, they remain a possibility, especially with long-term use of MMR vaccine. If you think you might be sensitive to these proteins, talk to your healthcare provider about what kinds of vaccinations you may still need.

Discussion

In this randomized crossover intervention study that assessed acute effects of high-dose nandrolone on measures of skin health, we found that chronic administration of nandrolone and its metabolites significantly reduced skin thickness and overall body composition in overweight men. Furthermore, our results suggest that increased circulating nandrolone levels might play a role in the maintenance of the changes induced by long-term consumption of nandrolone or its metabolite. This finding differs from those previously reported in nonobese subjects (27, 28), suggesting a direct link between these two compounds. However, more studies are needed to validate and elucidate this hypothesis. For example, there were significant differences between groups when participants' baseline weight was controlled (data not shown). Whether it is possible to reverse the negative effects of chronic overnutrition and obesity on skin function remains an important question.

3. Q: how often is a pregnancy confirmed? A: approximately 20% of pregnancies are known to be spontaneous, whereas around 60% are associated with fertilization. Approximately 50% of the total number of pregnancies (20%) will not be confirmed; these cases are usually referred to as ""false positives"". In addition, between 10 and 30% of all women are estimated to miscarry during their pregnancy and about 3-5% of women die.

4. Q: what happens if a woman miscarries while she has an ectopic pregnancy?

a. If there was no uterine atony or severe pain during a normal menstrual period after the endometrial lining began to disappear, then it can occur on its own without any further cause for concern. The ovaries may have become blocked, so the embryo may still be developing within the uterus. Some experts believe that a condition called endometriosis may contribute to this outcome. However, other specialists do not agree on whether endometriosis plays a role. b. If endometriosis has affected your uterine lining, then you should see your doctor for treatment immediately. c. If endometriosis has already occurred but cannot be removed through surgery, your doctor may perform laparoscopy to remove the tissue which is causing the blockage. This procedure can also result in scarring. d. For most women who develop a miscarriage, the loss occurs quickly following implantation. e. Occasionally, when fertilized eggs fail to complete development, a miscarriage may take place much later in the process. It is important to note that most abortions result from failure to reach the stage where the embryo implants and begins growing inside the womb. Therefore, even though some women experience a partial abortion of a pregnancy, the majority would actually be considered full term abortions since they would continue to develop normally after delivery. f. Some doctors believe that miscarriage is caused by something called a ""fibroid"" - small tumors found throughout the body which prevent the formation of blood vessels necessary for the growth of embryos. These tumors can sometimes grow so large that they obstruct the reproductive system altogether. There is currently no way to know if you are pregnant with fibroids before you begin taking birth control pills. G. When does pregnancy start? A. At the time of conception, sperm meets egg, forming a single cell called a zygote. This cell divides many times to form several hundred cells called blastocysts, each of which contains four million nuclei",98,most common complications in pregnancy,-9.83346939086914,103,q,1,0.5786516853932584,405,8

You may find that your job or occupation is restricted to a particular part of the world in which MS is prevalent. For example, some of you may have been told that you will be unable to work for many years while you recover from an MS diagnosis. However, if you feel ready to re-enter the workforce, we encourage you to contact us at careers@moses.org (or click on ""Career Opportunities"" in the left column). You can also look up your state's medical boards website. We urge everyone with MS to make sure they understand all their options.

What is the best treatment for Multiple Sclerosis?\nA: The best possible care for MS depends on where you live and how long you have had symptoms. If you have a slow progressive course of MS, it is important to speak directly with your health care professional about the most appropriate way to proceed. Unfortunately, there is no cure for MS. There is a great deal of hope that therapies such as drugs and other treatments can slow down the progression of the disease. Currently available medications are not approved by the FDA and may have side effects. Although these medications may help, there are still many unanswered questions about the impact of using them on the brain. It is imperative that patients know what is considered safe and effective when it comes to treatments. Our goal is to educate you so that you have a more informed choice and the tools necessary to choose the best treatment option.

If I'm diagnosed early enough, does that mean I won't need surgery or radiation therapy after all?\nA: No, MS is very treatable, but sometimes even the best doctors cannot anticipate every possible complication. When someone is diagnosed with MS before symptoms begin, surgeons and radiologists often recommend early intervention because MS has less risk factors than cancer and heart diseases. This means that, ideally, treatment should take place before any problems develop. In fact, some studies suggest that the first three months of treatment can reduce the rate of disability for those with MS. As a result, some MS specialists will consider delaying treatment until one year after onset rather than waiting until age 30 to determine if the person has progressed to irreversible dementia. Of course, it's essential to talk to your doctor about whether treatment should continue if you experience any unusual symptoms or neurological complications.

gpt2-xl_59,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS), the most common neurological disorder, affects approximately 1.2 million Americans; one in five patients will have symptoms of MS at some time during their lifetime, and the disease is often misdiagnosed and undertreated. Symptoms vary widely across different forms of the disease. For example, patients with optic neuritis may experience pain, dizziness or loss of vision. The condition may also include fatigue, impaired coordination, weakness, numbness, tingling, or aching muscles, headaches, anemia, nausea, fever, skin rash, nerve damage or paralysis. Patients with myasthenia gravis may feel muscle weakness, difficulty walking, balance problems, sleep disturbances, or hallucinations. In addition to symptoms, individuals with MS exhibit changes in their bodies that are unique from those who do not suffer from the disease. These physical changes can be caused by the disease itself, by medications taken for it, or by other factors. Some of these conditions may be treated using various treatments, including steroids or immune system therapy. It has been estimated that there are as many as 3.3 million people living with MS worldwide.

Q: what are the major causes of MS?


a: The precise cause of MS remains unknown. As previously stated, researchers have identified several possible causes, each having a role in the development of the disease. However, research conducted over the past 50 years has only demonstrated a link between certain types of inherited genetic mutations in genes called RPE65 proteins and the risk for developing MS. Other genetic predispositions may play a role in the progression of the disease.

Q: how does the brain get damaged?


a: Damage occurs within cells lining the central nervous system, specifically in areas involved in the control of movement, sensation, memory and cognition. Examples of this type of injury include damage to the dendrites of neurons — small branches of nerve cells that receive signals from other cells — which leads to abnormal activity in the neurons' axons. Researchers believe that this activity ultimately results in increased cell death, inflammation, and neuronal dysfunction.

Q: how is MS diagnosed?


a: A doctor will examine your medical history to determine if you have any signs or symptoms consistent with MS, such as a chronic condition, unusual weight gain, unexplained shortness of breath, depression, or seizures. He or she will conduct tests known as SPECT imaging (single photon emission computed tomography) or MRI scans to check the function of certain brain structures, like the",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-2.456902265548706,18,q,1,0.08823529411764706,402,2
gpt2-xl_54,"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, relapsing disease of the central nervous system. It affects the peripheral nerves and the brain. Its symptoms are often progressive and non-specific. The cause of MS is still unknown; however, genetic factors have been associated with an increased risk for developing the disease. There are three primary groups that are affected by MS: 1) People who develop the disease between ages 20 and 40; 2) people who have had the disease longer than 10 years prior to their symptoms manifesting (and who may have other underlying disorders); 3) individuals who develop MS after experiencing an event such as an injury or trauma during adolescence, young adulthood, or middle age. When you talk about multiple sclerosis, people typically think of what happens in the early stages of the disease. For example, if you experience numbness, tingling, burning, heat, weakness, or any other symptoms of MS that last more than two weeks, then your doctor will likely diagnose the condition. If this occurs, then you will usually be referred to a neurologist at a hospital or clinic where they can examine your spine and other structures using X rays or MRI scans to determine exactly what's happening inside your body. You'll also undergo tests such as MRI and CAT scan to assess how well your spinal cord controls your muscles and other organs. This is important because many times, patients do not fully recover from their MS symptoms until later on. In most cases, symptoms improve over time to allow a person with MS to move around, dress themselves, eat and drink normally, use the toilet, and communicate. But there are some situations in which MS symptoms persist for months or even years, such as those caused by spinal stenosis, tumors, infections, or damage to the optic nerve in the eye. With each new symptom you experience, we'll need to determine whether it's related to MS. One way that we might confirm a diagnosis of MS would be to perform an MRI that shows abnormalities in the parts of the brain responsible for coordinating movement. However, only about half of all people who have MS show signs or symptoms that could indicate that they've actually got the disease. Even when a patient does have symptoms that suggest MS, they're not always obvious to others and can't always be diagnosed accurately. This is why finding out if you have MS will require an ongoing investigation. Most often, your symptoms come and go over the course of a year or more but sometimes they just keep coming. And although we know that the onset of symptoms often varies from person to",54,What does multiple sclerosis diagnosis include?

gpt2-xl_52,"The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that between 12.8 and 15 percent of all American adults will experience some kind of major depression in any given year, with about 2.5 million Americans experiencing major depressive disorder each year (NIMH, 2004a). Major depression is a condition characterized by depressed mood lasting at least two weeks and associated with significant impairment in social, occupational or other areas of functioning. It often involves at least three symptoms:

1. A loss of interest or pleasure usually accompanied by weight loss

2. Lethargy or sleep disturbance

3. Feelings of guilt or worthlessness

4. Changes in appetite or weight

The NIMH also reports that suicide is the third leading cause of death for Americans aged 10 to 44 years old. Suicide is one of four main causes of death among men and women. Other major causes of death include accidents, homicides, and diseases including cancer and chronic respiratory disease (National Center for Injury Prevention and Control [NCIPC], 2006). Individuals who develop serious mental illness have an increased risk for suicidal behaviors (Paller et al., 2001; Sommers, 2005). An estimated 50 percent of people with severe depression attempt suicide during their lifetime (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 2003), and more than 20 percent will die from it within five years (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2010; CDC 2007) as compared to 16 percent of people without depression who commit suicide. These rates are similar to those seen in previous studies examining suicide attempts (Erez-Likhovskii et al., 2002). Most individuals diagnosed with depression receive treatment. Treatment consists of psychotherapy, medications, or both. Medications commonly prescribed for depression are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine, escitalopram, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, bupropion, and vilazodone. Other medication choices include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and lithium. SSRIs, which are used as monotherapy in about 75% of cases, do not cure depression but may help control its symptoms. Some patients respond well to antidepressant drugs alone, while others require several different treatments before they are fully treated. MAOIs and TCAs, typically used in combination, are considered ""medication-resistant"" because they tend to produce side",52,What are the most common mental health problems?

In this way, multiple components of the system are working together to address the underlying cause of symptoms. Holistic treatments focus on prevention, rather than diagnosis.

Q: Is there an emphasis placed on exercise/exercise prescriptions as part of holistic treatment?

A: There is no evidence that exercise alone can cure any illness; in fact, there is little evidence that any specific exercise regimen is effective at all. However, certain types of exercise have been shown to decrease the risk for conditions such as heart disease and stroke. For patients with chronic illnesses (such as diabetes), exercise may be recommended along with diet and lifestyle changes. For people who do not exercise regularly (such as those in sedentary jobs), a structured program of moderate physical activity may help them improve their quality of life by reducing the risk for many chronic diseases.

Q: How often should I see my doctor about my health concerns?

A: Your physician may ask you questions regarding your general health, family history, medications and other factors before making recommendations on how often to visit your doctor. It also depends on which type of health care provider you choose. Some providers offer free checkups at the beginning of the year, others send out patients' bills every month. If you plan to live independently and need regular checkups, discuss these options with your primary care provider so they know whether to refer you to a specialist or allow you to go without care for some time.

Q: Do I qualify for subsidized insurance if I don't receive coverage through my job?

A: Many employers offer their employees subsidized insurance plans. If you're eligible for federal government assistance programs like Medicaid and Medicare but your employer doesn't provide affordable insurance, you'll probably need to find private insurance through an exchange (a marketplace where consumers purchase policies online).

Dr. Wainwright: Well, I don't think so. That's why we want to make sure that whatever we do, whether it's using a genetic approach or an immunotherapy approach, that we look at it in as many people as possible, and that we have follow-up studies. But if we're finding one person who shows benefit, then we'll continue on with that drug. And we're also looking for another drug that might work in this setting.

It's important to note that there may be drugs that have some activity against MS lesions but not relapses.

In my experience, the most effective method of managing MS is an annual physical exam, which helps you track down any conditions that might be contributing to symptoms or cause problems. It's also important to remember that there are many factors that go into how a person with MS feels — like whether or not they've been exposed to chemicals in their environment or their food, for example, which could make them more sensitive to nerve damage or lead to other neurological issues. And while some treatments work well for certain people who have MS, others don't. So talk to your doctor about which ones work best for you.

Brett McKay: That sounds great. I'll put this together and see if I'm on time today. Yeah, I want to ask one more question before we wrap up, too, and it comes from Dr. Thomas D. Smith, MD. He says, ""I'm having trouble making sense of the word 'chronic.' Does chronic mean something like long term?"" If so, then what does the definition of chronic mean here?

Dr. Daniel Lieberman: I think a lot of people have heard that phrase because they hear it used when talking about people who smoke cigarettes, but it means different things depending on the context. One context is that it refers to someone whose condition has lasted for at least a year, and that's very specific as far as the disease goes. We're talking about chronic pain and arthritis and neuropathic pain — all these kinds of chronic diseases. Chronic often means longer than a year, though, and I would consider that just another way of saying prolonged. That doesn't necessarily mean you had MS for years or decades. Someone who has been diagnosed with MS will typically have it for a lifetime, whereas someone without MS may only have had symptoms for years or even decades. This is why MS is called the second oldest known disease in humans.

You could say that chronic pain and arthritis have been around longer, but they have different causes. They're not caused by the same thing. For instance, back pain can get worse over time, which leads to inflammation; this causes pain. But chronic pain is usually a result of stress, and it is largely genetic. Some of us inherit the gene for chronic pain, and some of us just haven't been able to learn to cope with stress properly yet.

You'll notice a couple of places where the MS\N file has some interesting words in it—like ""VIRUS"" and ""INVASION."" These are actually references to viruses on hard drives. If you look at the MS\N file carefully, you might notice that it contains some lines like this:

gpt2-xl_22,"no, I'm not diabetic but if you were to ask me that question I would say yes (3/20)

Answer: You are very unlikely to develop diabetes. The reason is due to an enzyme called glucokinase in your pancreas which breaks down dietary carbohydrates and converts them into glucose in the bloodstream so as to provide energy for your body. If this enzyme was missing or damaged it could lead to high blood sugar levels which can be dangerous. However, there are many other factors which can also contribute to diabetes such as obesity and a poor diet. It's important to keep up with your daily exercise routine and have good eating habits, not only do they help to control your weight and cholesterol levels but will also reduce the chances of developing diabetes. (4/20)

Q: I feel sluggish all day long, what should I eat? A: Your metabolism is slowing down and thus your hunger level rises. This is due to how many calories you consume each day, your body is still working hard to burn off those calories. Eating more will only make you hungrier and less likely to lose any weight because now your body has fewer resources left to work with. There may also be some chemical imbalances occurring inside your body because these changes affect hormones like leptin and ghrelin which determine how much food you need to take in in order to feel full. As well, you may find that when you eat fatty foods you feel hungry sooner than when you eat starchy foods, so you might want to cut back on your intake of fats and sugars (such as white bread). (5/20)

Q: My belly feels bloated after meals and I don't know why? A: If your stomach doesn't empty properly then your intestines will continue to function normally but your bowels won't. When your bowels aren't functioning normally then they become blocked and this blockage causes a feeling of fullness. When your gut is blocked the body tries to remove waste products from your system by passing urine through your skin. If you experience this sensation then you've got to let your bowels out regularly - even just once every four hours is better than letting them sit and cause discomfort. Many people have discovered that their tummy gets flatter if they wait until they're finished eating before flushing the toilet. Make sure you flush your bowels at least every couple of minutes while you're eating, as otherwise your bowels may stay blocked longer which will increase your chance of having bowel problems later.",22,my risk for developing type 2 diabetes,-10.40758991241455,208,q,1,0.832,432,4

Q: What should I do about my symptoms? A: Most people with multiple sclerosis have at least some symptoms that they can't explain, which means that there's no cure for MS and that most patients are left trying to live with their condition every day. The best way to treat your symptoms is by staying as active as you can while avoiding any triggers so that your immune system will be able to fight off any new attacks from the disease. If you've been diagnosed with MS, it's important that you talk to a doctor about how you're managing your symptoms before making decisions about treatment. You may need medication or surgery to help manage your condition if you're unable to manage them yourself.

Q: What are the chances of becoming ill or developing other complications related to Multiple Sclerosis? A: There is always a risk of getting sick or having other health issues when living with MS but this number varies depending on the severity of your symptoms and the type of MS you have. In general, women tend to be less likely than men to develop certain types of health issues such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart problems; however, women also have a higher chance of developing breast cancer in comparison with men. It's normal to experience some discomfort and difficulty during times when you feel unwell or when your symptoms get worse, especially when you're experiencing pain or stiffness in your legs and feet or vision problems. If you experience these symptoms, call your doctor right away – they could prescribe medicine to help relieve your pain and discomfort.

Questionnaire for disability rating of the major and peripheral nerves and brainstem syndrome (MDDS)\r


The MDDS is a questionnaire that determines whether you have a secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) or a primary progressive MS (PPMS). The score in this category ranges from 0 to 25. Your score will be assigned based on how your symptoms compare with those of people who do not have the condition. If your scores are above 20 you may qualify for disability benefits under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), if your scores are below 15 you may not be eligible. A score higher than 30 indicates a greater likelihood that you have SPMS. This is also known as a grade 3 or 4 case of SPMS. It can be very challenging to distinguish between an individual with PPS and a person with SPMS, especially since both conditions occur at roughly the same time in life and the two conditions often present together in the form of joint pains (joint pain and spondyloarthritis). The criteria used to determine which group you fall into depend upon the type of symptoms that were reported by patients (e.g., sensory, motor, psychiatric) and their age when they first presented with these symptoms. For more information about the MDDS and how it applies to you please contact the office nearest you directly.

You will then undergo medical evaluation by a neurologist or physical therapist. We use computerized neurological testing to determine the extent of any nerve damage and its severity. We take blood samples to test for clotting factors and monitor cholesterol levels. You may receive treatment using injections or medication, either alone or in combination with exercise therapy. As indicated by the doctor performing your tests and examination, we believe that there are no significant risks associated with your treatment. However, we cannot assure you against some side effects. These include allergic reactions, gastrointestinal problems, sleep disorders, urinary retention or incontinence, muscle cramps, headaches, increased risk of infection, dizziness and nausea. Other possible side effects include seizures, mood changes, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, loss of appetite, depression, anger, anxiety, insomnia, headache, diarrhea, skin rash, rashes, and impotence.

The exact mechanisms of how the immune system affects sleep at the cellular level or the way it affects our physiology as individuals need more investigation to prove whether MS and other neurological disorders have similar underlying factors which affect the way we sleep. \r

\r

""There is growing evidence that several diseases can cause changes in the amount of time spent asleep,"" said Dr Mascola from Newcastle University's Institute for Sleep Research. ""This may explain why some patients with insomnia seem to suffer more from sleep problems than others."" \r

According to the National Health Service (NHS), approximately one third of adults aged 65-74 will experience some type of daytime sleepiness, including trouble falling asleep, staying asleep or getting back to sleep. \r

If you're concerned about your ability to fall asleep tonight, try these tips: \r

Get some shut eye – if you feel sleepy and unable to get off to sleep, take a short nap first thing in the morning. This can help improve your chances of falling asleep again. Get up early – don't stay out too late doing something you enjoy, like watching TV or having a drink. Avoid caffeine – it makes you tired and less likely to sleep well. Don't eat too much sugar, alcohol or tobacco – they'll make you sleepy too. Drink plenty of water – you should have a glass of warm milk to drink every four hours during the day. Exercise regularly – walking, swimming, cycling and aerobics can all keep you awake if you want to get up earlier. Take an afternoon nap – you'll still feel tired but you won't be so groggy when you wake up. You might find yourself waking up feeling refreshed. \r

Dr David Anderson, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists' health advisory committee, says: ""While sleep disorders such as insomnia are common, it is not clear how many cases are actually caused by lack of sleep and how often they are preventable. This is particularly important for elderly people because poor quality sleep affects their mental and physical wellbeing."" \r",93,Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?,-0.0207999628037214,2,q,1,0.010101010101010102,377,19

There are some minor risks associated with using any medication that affects the nervous system, but these drugs should not have a major effect on your ability to think clearly or make decisions, and there are no known cases of death from an adverse reaction to the vaccine, although this could be caused by other factors such as infections in the weeks after vaccination.

Q: What kind of research was conducted before vaccines were developed?\nA: For over 100 years scientists had been investigating the possibility of making a better way of giving polio vaccines, but their attempts were stymied by one problem - how do you prevent children from getting sick so they won't spread the disease? In the 1920s doctors started looking at ways of preventing children contracting the virus. Some used chemicals called ""attenuation"" which prevented the body's immune system from attacking polio strains when administered to susceptible children. This worked well until the 1950s when polio immunization became widely available thanks to the success of British scientist Maurice Hilleman who discovered a new method of delivering live viruses into the small intestine through a mucosal surface (called enema). From then onwards it has been relatively easy to develop and produce vaccines against different diseases using this technique.

In recent decades, however, researchers found the development of vaccines was becoming more difficult. By the 1970s it became clear that poliovirus could survive in the intestinal tract indefinitely without being killed off by the host's immune system, even if given intravenously. Scientists began researching alternative methods to deliver vaccines and eventually settled upon a two-step process whereby a weakened form of poliovirus would be injected into the bloodstream followed by a series of injections into lymph nodes. The idea is that the lymph nodes will filter out weakened polioviruses which are unable to infect humans and the blood supply will carry them to the brain where they can cause paralysis (although no deaths have ever been reported following the use of vaccines containing the modified oral strain of poliovirus). However, it wasn't until 1996 that the first successful human trial of the oral version of the polio vaccine was carried out using a combination of three different strains of the virus. Despite these successes it was not until 2004 that the first licensed vaccine was approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the prevention of acute flaccid paralysis, which is caused by a variant of the virus called OPV (oral poliovirus type 1). As well as helping eradicate polio globally polio remains endemic in many parts of the world, particularly in Africa where",72,Is the Covid-19 vaccine safe for people taking multiple sclerosis drugs?,-6.435442924499512,110,q,1,0.5164319248826291,439,38
gpt2-xl_79,"Yes. The disease is not inherited, and there are no known genetic mutations in the MS gene(s). However, it is important for you to know that a diagnosis of MS requires three or more of the following: (1) a history of MS symptoms; (2) an MS-specific test showing abnormal CSF proteins on both peripheral blood smears and MRI scans; and (3) laboratory confirmation of CD4+ T-cell counts below 100 cells/mm 3. In some cases, these conditions can be found without having had any previous diagnosed MS symptoms.

Q: What medications should I use with my medications?\nA: There have been several clinical trials (a type of study where participants take different medication for varying periods over several months or years) that look at combining various types of anti-MS medicines in an attempt to improve their side effects. Unfortunately, all of this research has so far failed to yield any improvements in symptom relief. For those who do want to try combination therapy, we recommend that you consult your physician about which anti-MS drug combinations may work best for you.

gpt2-xl_58,"Yes, but there is no conclusive evidence that it causes MS. It may be a risk factor, or it could just be an effect of the disease itself. The chance of developing MS in someone who has not been exposed to environmental toxins is estimated at about 1 in 200 for those born after 1950.The only known link between exposure to pesticides and the development of MS is from organophosphates, a group of chemicals which include thiodicloprid (used on cotton) and chlorpyrifos (used on fruit trees). There are other possible links with organophosphate residues in fish such as tilapia and salmon which have high levels of these compounds. However, since this link has never been proven, it cannot be used to guide our current safety level for glyphosate residue in food.Q: Is there any connection between exposure to glyphosate and the development of cancer?A: No. Glyphosate does not appear to be carcinogenic when used according to directions on label. There appears to be very little evidence for any possible association. We do know that some people can become sensitive to certain foods when they use glyphosate.

A: ""Yes."" [They had a conversation] about the use of inhalers to control asthma. He said, ""You know, I've seen kids with it — they don't have that kind of trouble — but if you're not careful, there's always something going on."" And then he showed me a picture of his daughter, who was in kindergarten at the time. She had this terrible cough and was wheezing so hard she couldn't even speak. So I just thought to myself, ""Wow, there are these kids out there who need help and aren't getting it,"" because I'd never heard anything like that. I'm thinking to myself, ""This is a kid whose parents can do something right here."" It was very sad. But he gave me some great advice about asthma, which was good advice. And when we finished our meeting, he invited me over for dinner. We talked for hours.

I think what people usually fail to recognize in all this is the fact that there really is no cure or treatment for what's wrong with many people with HIV/AIDS. There isn't a vaccine; there isn't a drug. The only way someone with AIDS could possibly be cured would be by finding a biological marker for the virus. As far as being treated for the disease, there's nothing that anybody has discovered yet, except maybe one thing: some combination of drugs that have long been used to treat tuberculosis. They work reasonably well — maybe better than those medicines — but they haven't made any headway in curing HIV/AIDS.

[We decided] if there were any treatments for AIDS, it should start with a different approach to treatment. That doesn't mean that we should stop treating patients with antiretroviral therapy; it means that we should treat them differently from how we currently do HIV medicine, treating them not as sick people but rather as healthy individuals in their prime who need to be cared for as such. We should also try to find ways to prevent transmission of HIV to others.

Because of your background, did you feel personally responsible for making sure that other people were taken care of?

There was an irony about it. Although I'd become a public health professional, I wasn't trained in HIV prevention.

The next exercise I'll discuss in more detail is the Pinch Press. This exercise can help relieve pain in both of your shoulders. It helps to release pressure on your head from the back biceps tendon by pressing on it with a small amount of force. As a result, the bicep becomes stronger, which makes things easier for you to do other pressing motions like bench presses, curls etc. If you find yourself having trouble performing some of these movements because they feel too painful then try using this exercise as well. You will notice that as soon as you start feeling any discomfort at all just relax and hold the position for 5-10 seconds. It's important not to let the resistance go down too much and keep an even tension throughout the set. Make sure not to raise your hands above chest level while doing this exercise. You should maintain perfect balance and form throughout the whole movement. To perform this exercise do 3 sets of 8 reps with 85% of 1RM each set. Do 1-2 sets per day. For example:

What if I have my blood work done? Do I need to take corticosteroids before and after taking Lantus?

If you are prescribed a dose of Lantus for a non-traumatic condition, you do not need to stop treatment with your regular medicine as long as you continue to follow your doctor's directions. If you experience pain during or after the injection or if there is bleeding or bruising while taking Lantus, contact your healthcare provider immediately or go to an emergency room right away. However, you will likely be able to resume using your usual medications without stopping them. The same applies to people who were previously treated with steroids before starting therapy with Lantus. They should continue to follow their normal steroid dosage, but should use caution when taking extra doses of this medication.

Are there any side effects associated with Lantus?

Lantus does not cause any serious side effects like liver problems or cancer. These drugs may change how your body handles certain hormones (including those related to pregnancy), so you must tell your healthcare provider about any changes to your hormone levels.

If you stop taking Lantus, it could take several weeks for your symptoms to disappear completely. You will also probably feel slightly sick. Also, because most people start to gain weight around three months post-treatment, your weight may increase during the first week or two following your last dose of Lantus.

In addition, some people experienced nausea or stomach cramps. Some people experienced swelling of the hands and feet; however, this was generally milder than what would happen with chemotherapy. In rare cases, a person experiencing such events experienced an allergic reaction to Lantus. This occurred in one report of a 5-year-old child who received cyclophosphamide. No other reports of adverse reactions were reported among patients taking Lantus.

Should I get more tests prior to beginning my next cycle of chemotherapy?

Before beginning chemotherapy, make sure your doctor has confirmed all of the information on this page to ensure that your risk of getting cancer is minimized.

The best thing would be to talk with a good nutritionist. You can find one at your local health food store. If you want to eat healthy foods like vegetables, fruits and whole grains, then it helps if you know what those nutrients are, so that you can balance the food that you put on your plate. But if you don't know how much protein you should be eating—for instance, if you're going vegetarian for ethical reasons—then just learn about the different types of proteins that are found in plant-based foods (like beans). Try to consume as many vegetables and fruits as possible each day, especially when you're getting ready for bed. If you add vegetables and fruit together, you end up consuming fewer calories overall, which makes sense because plants naturally contain lots of water, fiber and vitamins and minerals, so this is really important for weight control.

Treatment for CEDs is often aimed at reducing inflammation or improving the immune system function. The goal of treatment is generally to decrease symptoms to the extent possible. If this doesn't work, then drug therapy may be considered (see below).


For CEDs that are due to an infection, antibiotics will usually reduce the duration or severity of your symptoms. However, most infections resolve on their own without any intervention. You can also try a combination of antihistamines and antacids as well as dietary changes, such as giving up dairy products, egg yolks and seafood.

gpt2-xl_45,"Yes, but the process is very complicated. First of all you have to remove the cause, then eliminate it, and finally replace it. A better question would be can diabetes be prevented? The answer is yes.\r

\r

The first step in controlling diabetes is removing insulin from circulation. That's why people are often referred to as diabetics or prediabetic because they're already diabetic when their blood glucose levels exceed a certain threshold (usually at about 140 mg/dl). This is called hyperglycemia \u2014 which means too much sugar (glucose) in your bloodstream. If your blood glucose level goes over this threshold, you'll need to get rid of some of that sugar through insulin injections.\r

\r

There are two main types of insulin available on the market today: \u201cHumalog\u201d and \u201cLantus\u201d. Humalogs work by adding small amounts of insulin to the blood stream instead of using it directly. Lantus works similarly but uses the body's own cells to make the hormone. Both drugs take effect slowly enough that you don't feel any effects until your blood glucose level drops below the pre-set target for each drug. These targets vary widely depending on your age, gender and other factors. But if you meet them, your doctor will probably prescribe one of these drugs along with an oral medication that helps increase your supply of the right kind of insulin. Once your glucose is under control, your doctor will start watching your blood glucose level more closely. It's essential to note, however, that once your diabetes is controlled, there is no guarantee that your diabetes won't come back, even after years of healthy eating and regular exercise.\r

\r

One way or another, though, you can prevent diabetes in its tracks. Diabetes, like most chronic diseases, has many causes. But eliminating the underlying problem doesn't always solve the root cause; it just shifts the focus away from trying to fix something that can\u2019t possibly be fixed. For example, reducing physical activity may reduce your risk of developing diabetes, but it certainly isn't going to stop it. In fact, studies show that physical activity improves insulin sensitivity in obese individuals, but not those who aren't overweight. Furthermore, exercise alone does not improve the overall health of a person who suffers from type 2 diabetes. \r

And then she woke up and it was like she had this head cold, but she thought it was just me. Then after that day, she would wake up every two hours screaming for hours, crying. So, I think it could just be an underlying problem. But you know, I have a really good night's sleep now; that was actually one thing that helped me feel better.

Q: if someone did come into your house and they wanted to rape you will there be a big reaction? A: (laughs) Well, I don't know what kind of reactions it might generate from people. It depends on how violent you are.

Q: Do you have any advice for women who want to learn more about their sexual anatomy? A: I think this is one of the most important things in life. Because sex education has been left to teenagers.

You'd think that doctors would give them proper terminology. I mean they have to understand that this isn't a word that we used in the past, and it is only used in medical contexts, but if that's the case, why do you even need a diagnosis label on the box? Why don't you just call it what it is? The same thing goes with intercourse. You know, the vagina is a very intimate part of the female body, and most people seem to forget that.

Q: Can one's kidneys be removed as well?

Yes, in certain rare circumstances. These patients usually have an extremely weak immune system which makes them more susceptible to infections and is also why they're prone to developing kidney disease. Patients with this condition who have had their kidneys removed often require dialysis or a kidney transplant. The only time this isn't true is when a patient has died from the complications of the procedure itself.

Question 8

Hi Dr. Gernsbacher, I am very sorry to hear about your death. What were the details you were able to find on the cause of his death? He was a healthy man until he developed chest pain, then developed sudden heart failure which led to his death. Also, I just read that he was diagnosed with POTS. Can you please tell me more about this diagnosis and how it affects someone? Thank you!

The specific medical term associated with POTS is pulmonary atresia. This means that the lungs are too small for blood flow through them. It occurs most commonly with severe obesity (body mass index over 40), diabetes, high blood pressure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).


Pulmonary atresia is caused by a lack of oxygen getting into the body. It manifests in several ways, including shortness of breath, decreased lung function, increased fatigue, and muscle weakness. Often, these symptoms occur suddenly and without warning, while some people may notice nothing unusual during an episode. But all POTS sufferers should seek immediate care and refer themselves to a physician immediately, especially if they experience symptoms lasting longer than 2-3 days.

gpt2-xl_77,"Menopausal disorders have been associated with an increased risk of developing MS. These include hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), premature menopause, osteoporosis and other health conditions that cause loss of bone mass.

In the study, which was published online in May 2008 in The Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry, researchers found a significant increase in the number of women with MS who also had symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome after they underwent surgery for a hysterectomy. They also examined three different groups -- those who reported having MS before surgery and those whose symptoms were not yet diagnosed -- and found that about one-third of all women undergoing this type of surgery experienced some kind of chronic illness before their operation.

""We see very similar patterns between what we call 'preoperatively' MS and postoperative MS,"" said Dr. David A. Spence, chief of neuroendocrinology at the Mayo Clinic. ""And it's because these women are exposed to a lot of stress during the time before their surgeries. So if you look at the menstrual cycle as well, you can predict pretty accurately whether someone has MS.""

The scientists noted that many factors could account for the link between MS and menstruation and the menstrual cycle. For example, people with MS may have impaired immune function or hormone balance that affects how much estrogen is produced during the month. In addition, there is evidence that estrogen levels are related to pain.

It may be that some women with MS who suffer from both premenstrual exacerbations and premenstrual syndrome also experience a flare up of the disease when they begin their period again. However, the researchers noted that more research is needed to determine what specific impact this might have on MS.

Dr. George Klenk, professor emeritus of obstetrics/gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, agrees that the findings have important implications for doctors treating both women and men with MS.

""Menstruating women are often told by their doctor or nurse that they must take care not to use products containing estrogen, such as tampons, because estrogen could trigger a relapse of the disease,"" he said. ""But these same precautions seem unlikely to protect menopausal women against a recurrence of their own medical condition.""",77,How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?,-0.0384497605264186,0,q,2,0.0,372,8

This means that women who develop CHD during pregnancy have more than double the risk of dying as women without CHD during pregnancy.[5][6]


In the late 1970s researchers discovered that the hormone progesterone was involved in maintaining blood pressure and that it could be used by the body to control CHD. During the 1980s scientists began using this knowledge to treat pregnant women with CHD. Many doctors felt that they were doing something good because there was some data showing that the progestin had an effect on CHD, however, others felt that their methods were not based on scientific evidence.[7]


What we know about CHD and progesterone treatment has changed significantly since 1973 when Dr. James Yancey first showed that progesterone might help manage CHD. The latest research shows that progesterone does indeed affect blood pressure in people who suffer from hypertension. In fact, it seems that progesterone can lower blood pressure by up to 3/8ths! There are also numerous anecdotal reports of patients experiencing significant improvement in their condition after taking progesterone-containing pills. However, if your doctor recommends you take progesterone pills, make sure she knows what she's talking about; many medical doctors believe that progesterone should only be prescribed for those with a specific genetic mutation associated with high blood pressure, which is called HBP1.

My biggest fear is that some day I might need an operation. When you are young and healthy, your body can handle the impact of such an event without much trouble - as long as you're in good health and keep a positive attitude to life. However, once you start having symptoms, you have to accept that you may not live another ten years.

They often try to figure out what was wrong with me and then suggest an intervention plan. In some cases I do get suggestions on what type of treatment should be done and what medication I should take. But even though I try to put myself in their shoes, I still dread what will happen when my condition becomes more severe. It may turn into chronic pain which only makes me more depressed and anxious.

For example, when you see someone in distress, just talk quietly to them and make sure they know you care. And when you meet people for the first time, try to introduce them with 'Hi, my name is...' rather than saying 'I am so sorry', as you'll want to avoid causing offence. Many people have already come to the conclusion that there is nothing they can do for you. That's why it's important to listen to those close to you.

Abstract\r


""The objective of this study was to assess the benefits and risks associated with physical activity during pregnancy, based on available evidence in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. Data from 12 RCTs were included; all were published between 1991 and 2010. Meta-analyses demonstrated that moderate exercise performed for 30 min/day or more significantly reduced the risk of preeclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), while performing less than 60 min/day was not effective at reducing these conditions. The results also showed a dose response relation, indicating that greater amounts of exercise are associated with lower rates of adverse outcomes such as preterm birth, neonatal hypertension, low Apgar score (<4), and cesarean section.""

Exercise can prevent complications of pregnancy - by exercising you can reduce your chances of having problems with childbirth, so you should get active! It's worth noting that physical training before becoming pregnant is still advised, but not recommended after pregnancy due to potential differences in intensity and duration of contractions.


If you are going into labour, make sure you do not try to push too hard because if you don't take it easy after giving birth, you could end up damaging your baby and yourself even further if they go past their head first, or if you attempt to give them CPR, you could be risking them dying, not to mention that you will be putting yourself through something that will likely cause pain and discomfort in the most crucial time of life in the process. So...don't overdo it!


I recommend doing some form of aerobic exercise whenever you have the chance to. I would say this includes walking, cycling, running and swimming, although there are many other ways you can go about getting exercise. If you feel like you need extra help then start working out with weights, yoga, pilates etc. Just remember that when pushing through labor, nothing feels better than being able to push against gravity for just a little bit longer!",97,benefits of physical activity,-0.937404990196228,61,q,2,0.273542600896861,333,13

Q: numbness and tingling of extremities? A: Pain at the site of the injury(s), pain or tenderness (especially in the fingertips) on the side of where the skin was torn. This may be worse when moving the affected area. The symptoms are usually felt more often than not, but can also occur rarely. Q: swelling and redness A: Itching, burning, blisters or crusting of the skin that occurs for no apparent reason. There could be small areas of reddening that heal without scarring (red spots). If the rash persists, it should be evaluated further. Q: numbness in face A: numbness or tingly sensation in either hand. Usually mild enough to be ignored.


Q: difficulty walking? A: When you have had an eye injury, you may experience difficulty with balance, coordination, or locomotion. Do not allow yourself to fall down from a great height or try to jump over anything large; these activities might cause further damage. Q: muscle weakness/weakness? A: Weakness of one or both legs, particularly those of the lower body, caused by decreased strength in that particular leg due to the loss of blood flow due to the eye injury. Some people report that this type of weakness only affects their left leg or both legs. However, many patients will report that they feel weak in both legs as well. Sometimes both limbs may appear weaker than usual. For example, when doing something such as walking up stairs, one's leg appears to bend in an unusual way (e.g., bent knees). This inability to walk normally may persist even after treatment has been completed.

gpt2-xl_94,"In the first 2 months after your surgery you should be able to have some light movements and a ""feeling"" of walking again. After that, it is still best to avoid heavy activity as much as possible until your immune system has healed, since there are many things which can cause problems during this time, such as infections, toxins, radiation or even pregnancy complications (which can also raise your risk for MS). There are also medications which may not work immediately, but will help reduce symptoms and improve your quality of life. But remember, once you start taking these medications they need to be taken correctly so that your body won't reject them by over-reacting, and in order to get maximum benefit from them you need to know how to take them. It's important to consult with an experienced MS specialist when starting out on any medication.

Q: What kind of support do I receive now?\nA: The most important thing right now is that we are working together as a team to look after each other as well as our own health. We all share a common goal – to overcome MS and live full and happy lives. You can always come visit us at Our Mission at the Centre and see what's going on and ask us questions about MS and anything else related. We hope you'll join us!

Q: How much does Multiple Sclerosis cost?\nA: For the majority of patients MS costs between $11000 - $30000 per year. Many people say that they would prefer not having MS, because it means living with one chronic disease rather than several. However, if you can afford it, MS can make a big difference in your quality of life. All of our programs include an initial checkup with our registered nurse(s) where you can learn more about MS and get a basic understanding of what the treatment plans are and the risks involved. Also, every patient who participates in our program receives a complimentary pair of orthotics and/or braces which provide substantial improvement in their ability to walk. We offer a variety of different packages depending on your individual needs. You can find out more here: http://www.multiple-sclerosis.ca/health-care-coverage-and-benefits/. Please note that our fees are based on a sliding scale. Some memberships are available only to eligible individuals, while others are open to everyone. All memberships are valid for 1 year from date of activation. Additional fees and services are subject to change without notice.

gpt2-xl_102,"It's because you're not really being careful enough to keep your hands clean. Your skin is so sensitive that it can't handle the dryness of a shower for too long, and even if you do wash your hands after using the bathroom, there are other bacteria on your hand. I usually get my hands thoroughly rinsed with soap right before leaving the house (or at least make sure they're completely dried off) but some people like having their hands wet when taking a bath or shower...others may prefer to avoid germs altogether. If that makes sense.Q: Why does my hair feel greasy?A: When you first start out with shampooing your hair, it can take about 6 months for the oils in your scalp to start working properly again. At this point, it will probably look greasy until the new oil production is up to snuff. After about 3-4 weeks of getting use to your hair getting clean, you should see an improvement!Q: My hair feels coarse/thick - how does this happen??A: This can be caused by many things. The most common one is just trying out different shampoos and conditioners. Sometimes the only solution is to switch from a sulfate based conditioner to a less sulfated version. Another reason is maybe you have some sensitivity to certain ingredients in shampoos; however, most shampoos contain all the essential oils needed for healthy hair. Even though these oils might irritate your scalp, they won't cause problems unless you also suffer from very dry, flaky skin.Q: Is there anything that I can do to help my hair grow faster?A: There are tons of ways you can boost growth. One way to give your hair a little extra oomph is to put it into a ponytail. Try wearing a ponytail during the day and then tucking it into a bun overnight. You'll notice that after a few days you'll start seeing more growth. Also, washing your hair will help speed up its recovery time. Q: How often should I brush my hair?A: To maintain your cuticle health and prevent split ends, brushing your hair twice a week helps. For those who don't want to brush their hair, you can also try a quick heat treatment using a hairdryer or blowdryer. While this isn't guaranteed to help your curls grow faster, I've seen amazing results from using a combination of products such as Conditioner + Heat + Leave-In Treatment.

Q: which medications should be used during labor and delivery?A: oral or injectable anti-seizure medication such as Depakote, phenytoin, carbamazepine. Also try an antiseptic.


Q: what is the best time to give birth when breastfeeding can be avoided?A: before 36 weeks gestation. This will allow enough milk supply for both mother and baby. If you are going into labour at 39 weeks, it may not work well to keep your baby on breast milk until after 34 weeks. You could also use a formula with more protein. This should be made with cow's milk and can be given either by bottle, syringe or pump. It is important that a woman uses only this product if there are no complications or any signs of infection. Your health care provider may recommend using another type if other products do not help.


Q: is it safe to deliver my baby early because I am breastfeeding?A: Yes, it is possible. When the uterus has grown and the cervix has been dilated, the baby's head is now inside the pelvis. The muscles of the pelvic floor contract and push the baby down and out of the vagina. Babies born early often have short vaginal births, but they usually stay intact (unborn). In fact, early babies who are delivered early have less perineal trauma than later deliveries (Crowell 1990). Early pregnancies tend to be lighter and easier to get through because of their shorter duration. They tend to end sooner too so are more likely to be born at home. As the size of a baby grows, he/she tends to become heavier and move around more. Early delivery allows you to deliver the right sized baby without risk of serious problems to the mommy or baby.",98,most common complications in pregnancy,-11.593098640441896,154,q,2,0.8651685393258427,291,2
gpt2-xl_8,"how to use.

For those who have never used one, the app is a lot like using an iPhone — you've got your home screen, with all your favorite apps and their icons; the left side of the screen has quick access to the settings; and on the right side is the main menu (with a handy search function). You can swipe from any icon in that menu to open it up for more information or look around a bit before hitting the back button. If you're looking at the top of the main menu, you'll see options to add new accounts, sign into an account, get support, download the latest version of the app, and even change the wallpaper. To help make it easier to find these things, each option includes a shortcut to the page of related info. For example, when you tap ""add"" on the bottom left of the main menu, you'll immediately be taken to Account Settings if there's one available — otherwise, just go straight to Add Account. The app also lets you import accounts into the OneNote app so you won't need to sync your devices again.

The rest of the app looks very much like other OneNote users expect it to look; everything is organized and accessible via swipes down from the top of the screen and upward toward the bottom. There are several categories, including your notebooks, notes, calendar items, reminders, images, audio files, videos, photos, voice memos, text messages, and documents. In addition, each category has its own sub-categories that let you sort your content by date added/deleted/viewed/read.

There's no clear way to filter through these categories, but I'm happy with what I found; a few times, a note would show up as a reminder for something else I was working on but I didn't want to bother going back to it to pick up where I'd left off; this wasn't really an issue, though, because the categories themselves weren't particularly cluttered.

To create new notebooks, you simply drag a photo from your Camera Roll onto the blank space below the name. Notebooks created in OneNote aren't automatically saved across devices, nor are they stored locally on the device itself. Instead, once you save them in OneNote, they remain synchronized between your devices until you delete them — which means there's only ever one notebook per device. But then, you don't necessarily always have to keep separate copies of your notebooks and OneNote syncing saves them",8,best apps daily activity exercise diabetes,-13.542960166931152,228,q,2,0.9661016949152542,415,1

There are many reasons why this might happen including personal and family commitments, occupational requirements (some occupations require contact with the body's immune system), limited job experience, and other factors related to disability. A more detailed article on managing the impact of multiple sclerosis on work can be found here. \r

""The fact remains, however, that MS affects nearly 5% of Americans. This means that at least five percent of these individuals must have some form of MS to function in their jobs. As such, they should avoid any activities that expose them to other people with MS.""


Q: What does an employee need to do if he/she has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis before being hired?\nA: An employee who receives a diagnosis of MS during pre-employment screening should take action immediately. One of the first things you should do after receiving your diagnosis is consult a physician for evaluation. The best way to learn more about MS is through education; seek out as much information as possible from people living with MS or their friends. A good place to start is by visiting www.ms.org. Your doctor may refer you to an MS support group. Another excellent resource is the Multiple Sclerosis Society of America (MSSA). More information is available at http://www.msausa.com/. In addition, please consider finding additional medical assistance before applying for the position. Many employers offer paid sick days. Also, consider asking if there is an insurance plan offered for employees with MS. If not, then consider obtaining coverage now. Finally, ask if the company provides a reasonable accommodation. For example, if a supervisor needs to leave early so that he/she can attend to an emergency situation, consider informing the employer that this is what you would like done. You may also wish to see a lawyer or go directly to MSSA or the MS Department of Labor for further legal advice. To request assistance with a complaint filed against your employer, call the Illinois Department of Labor Complaint Assistance Program toll free at 877-869-9777 between 7am and 11pm, Monday thru Friday, excluding holidays. Please note that this program is only available in English. Q: Is it common for employers to ask me about my health history prior to hiring me?\nA: Employers often make inquiries about potential employees' medical histories upon hire.

How Tobacco Use Affects Your Health

Excessive amounts of nicotine can be harmful to your health. Nicotine has been linked with an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, lung infections, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and throat irritation.

Smoking cigarettes releases toxic substances into the air that are harmful to human life. Studies have shown that second hand smoke contains approximately 10% more carcinogens than first hand smoke. This is why most indoor smokers exhale far less harmful toxins than non-smokers when they breathe out smoke. In addition, there is also evidence showing that smokers experience increased problems with their lungs as compared to nonsmokers because of the higher level of toxins found in tobacco smoke.",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-0.0554307997226715,3,q,2,0.014705882352941176,317,4
gpt2-xl_54,"Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease. It's a collection of symptoms caused by the immune system attacking and damaging your brain cells, called myelin sheath, which surround your neurons. The body responds to this damage by producing antibodies that attack these damaged nerves in the CNS (central nervous system), called demyelinating lesions. These lesions are caused by the buildup of abnormal proteins within nerve fibers, and they can lead to loss of motor skills and vision. Because MS progresses over time and often involves progressive weakness or paralysis, you may not recognize any changes to your physical condition for several years after the onset of symptoms. At times, doctors will only notice progression from one manifestation of MS to another during a comprehensive neurologic evaluation. For example, if there are no clear changes at first, but then one day a person experiences blurred vision or slurred speech and later develops trouble speaking and swallowing, an MRI might be ordered to confirm the diagnoses. A second MRI may also be needed to determine if the worsening features have progressed into full-blown MS.

What is the cost of living with multiple sclerosis?\nA: The annual average cost of living is $15,000 for a single individual. An individual with multiple sclerosis generally spends about half their income on caregiving expenses and expenses related to transportation, food, clothing, medications, and other costs associated with living with the disease. Health insurance premiums typically account for nearly 90 percent of these expenses, while government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid cover the balance of the bill. If you're a low-income worker without health insurance, this cost increases substantially. In 2015, the median household income for individuals who did not have employer-sponsored coverage was $44,721, and the median family income was just under $90,000. People with severe chronic diseases often need special assistance from health professionals, including nurses, social workers, dietitians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, chiropractors, speech pathologists, etc., because of the significant financial burden associated with managing their disabilities. While having multiple sclerosis can drastically reduce an individual's earning potential, it doesn't mean that a person cannot afford to live a healthy lifestyle. Many people find ways to make work and social life possible despite limitations due to MS. If you want to learn more about how you could benefit financially from MS treatment, visit the U.S. National Multiple Sclerosis Society website or call 1-800-977-5626.

gpt2-xl_52,"Mental illness affects millions of people worldwide. It is estimated that the prevalence rate for depression in the United States is 17%, and it is likely to be even higher among women (1). As a result, there may not be a single disorder that is more common than another across all populations. While many individuals with depression experience significant distress over their condition, others have no problem functioning. The number one risk factor for developing major depressive disorder is having a family history of this disease (2). It has been reported that up to 50% of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder had an older brother or sister who also experienced symptoms of depression (3). Most people with serious mental disorders do not seek treatment because they do not know where to go or how to get help. Many believe that a diagnosis means you must accept your condition as normal, but this simply is not true. There is an urgent need for better screening tools to identify people at high risk for suicide before the onset of a depressive episode. In addition, interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy or medication management may reduce suicidal thoughts in some cases. It is important to realize that being treated for a mental health condition does not guarantee recovery from depression. For example, people with schizophrenia who receive proper medical care often recover completely. However, those with untreated psychosis will remain vulnerable to future episodes of the same disorder.

Examples of these therapies might be homeopathy and acupuncture.\r


Q: What is integrative medicine and how can it help patients with chronic disease?\nA: Integrative medicine consists of various approaches in addition to conventional care that work together to promote wellness and long-term recovery from complex medical problems. The most common treatments used within integrative medicine are diet (including supplements), lifestyle changes (such as increased activity levels or stress management), and medication (often prescription drugs). One approach to achieving optimal health through integrative medicine involves combining multiple modalities into an integrated treatment program. Some common modalities included in this approach include biofeedback, massage therapy, nutritional counseling and nutrition. While not all integrative practitioners specialize in one modality or group of modalities, many practitioners offer a wide range of modalities at a reasonable price. A good example of an integrative practice would be a naturopathic physician who focuses on digestive health and detoxification.\r


Q: What types of diseases and conditions affect individuals differently?\nA: Different diseases and conditions will impact people differently based upon their genes, genetic makeup, age, gender, weight, physical activity level, ethnicity, environmental exposures, social interaction and lifestyle choices. For instance, some diseases may only affect certain populations more than others, including people with poor socioeconomic backgrounds, younger adults, women, or members of certain racial groups. Other diseases and conditions may affect different groups equally, such as diabetes mellitus affecting both men and women, stroke affecting everyone, asthma affecting both children and adults, and arthritis affecting both children and adults. These differences may contribute to the severity of disease symptoms among different groups. For example, someone with heart failure may require less medication and medical intervention than someone who has diabetes or hypertension.\r

gpt2-xl_114,"Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a complex, chronic psychiatric condition that can lead to severe mood swings, self-destructive behaviors, and loss of control. A person with BPD has patterns of unstable or intense emotional responses to life events, including romantic relationships, work problems, family tensions, rejection from friends/family, financial difficulties, environmental stressors, etc. People who have BPD feel that they are not capable of feeling anything except anger and fear, and that their feelings are all too real and painful, often for years on end. Most people with BPD struggle with the following three core symptoms:(1) an unstable, intense emotional response to normal everyday experiences;(2) persistent feelings of emptiness/happiness/loneliness;(3) inappropriate use of words or phrases.(4) Excessive guilt or shame in response to negative emotions.(5) Impulsivity or reckless disregard for safety.(6) Irritability (may be intermittent);(7) Inappropriate, destructive behavior such as uncontrolled anger, irritability, trouble sleeping, difficulty concentrating, acting out, reckless driving, substance abuse, promiscuity, eating disorders (including anorexia), and sexual promiscuity.(8) Extreme changes in temper, body language, mannerisms, speech, or other aspects of personal appearance.(9) The inability to enjoy one's own thoughts, feelings, activities, and surroundings.(10) Repeatedly experiencing devastating setbacks (often culminating in significant losses).A person with BPD may also experience extreme distress about being unable to control his/her moods, whether due to mood dysregulation or depression. For example, someone with a history of severe BPD may be so desperate to avoid abandonment by loved ones that he/she will ignore evidence of abusive behavior (such as bruises) when present.People who live with BPD suffer greatly because their interpersonal relationships are constantly at risk of ending, and often because their moods swing rapidly between extreme happiness and extreme sadness. Even if there was never any violence involved, people living with BPD frequently report that they were abused as children, and that this experience traumatized them and shaped how they view themselves and others.People with BPD also often report that they often find it difficult to trust others, especially close family members. Some have been accused of stealing money or even assaulting their siblings or parents. Other relatives may accuse them of having ""crazy"" ideas, being unhinged or unstable, or simply making up stories about what happened during childhood.The intensity",114,borderline personality disorder symptoms,-0.0197531711310148,2,q,2,0.018518518518518517,367,3

Q: I have an older child who has relapsed after 1 year of treatment with cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan). Is this a serious condition? A: It can be. This disease is very similar to MS and should not be confused with the relapse associated with MS. In fact, people with the same symptoms as those seen in MS are often diagnosed with relapses of their own. So you need to get your child evaluated by a neurologist or other specialists when he/she becomes more symptomatic than usual, particularly if they have had an increase in their symptoms over time. Also check out the FAQs section on Relapse to learn about some common signs of relapses.

In general, many people with MS also experience other forms of MS (also called secondary progressive MS) which may take years or decades to develop and do not respond to therapy. You should consult with your physician for any additional information regarding any new onset of symptoms, including changes that occur while taking treatment or after discontinuing treatment.

Q: How long does it usually take for MS to go away? A: MS is a chronic disabling disease that typically progresses slowly and steadily throughout the course of life, but sometimes the progression is faster or slower. If you have been treated for MS for several months, you may want to continue your treatment. If you've been getting well during the past few years, you may no longer need treatment. When it's just started, there is a lot that goes wrong. So talk with your doctor and ask how much you should stick around for.

Q: Can my family member who has MS work? A: Yes, but it will depend on your individual circumstances. Some people with MS have problems lifting heavy objects, so they might want to avoid such jobs until the disease has gone into remission. Other workers might be able to work safely. And others may find working harder rather than less difficult since most tasks are now easier for them because of the loss of muscle strength.

Q: What do I tell my spouse or partner who has MS? A: Talk to your physician about any concerns that might arise related to MS at home. Sometimes spouses or partners of people with MS find it helpful to keep track of what medications are being taken. They can then discuss these medications with their husbands or wives before they start or stop taking them. The medication regimen will be different for each person depending upon their specific needs, but there may be some overlap.",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-2.808579921722412,95,q,2,0.48223350253807107,435,0

Q: drug addiction\nA: drugs addiction.

I've seen a lot of people asking about the different types of answers that can be given to this question, so I'll just give some general information here:

1) A yes answer will be one where the person has used or is currently using (or trying to use or trying to start using) a substance, including alcohol and/or tobacco in any form and/or at any frequency since age 18.

2) A no answer will be one where the person is not currently using or has stopped using (including stopping altogether), but hasn't had a drink or smoked for 2 months prior. This is known as abstaining from all substances. This type of response may also be called ""non-binge"" behavior.

3) In the case where someone smokes while sober, they are considered non-smokers.

gpt2-xl_95,"The following are some of the most common problems with reading in MS\nA. The information given below is taken from a number of different sources, so it should be considered as being incomplete and subject to change at any time. It may be helpful to refer to your teacher or school librarian for further help if you have questions about using MS\nA.

Reading Problems in MS\nA

1) ""How do I get my text into print?""

MS\nA contains features which can make printing easier than ever before. In addition to its various ways of displaying and copying texts, MS\nA provides the Print Preview function which allows you to preview what will appear on your computer screen when you print your document. You can also add text to an existing file, thereby allowing you to print just the parts that interest you. The ability to import text files from other programs helps students understand how to format their work, and it allows them to save and edit documents. Students who need assistance with this should ask their instructor or school librarian for help.

2) ""I'm trying to copy someone else's file and get all the formatting correct. Can I still use MS\nA?""

Yes! Most people who want to print their work without having to worry about all the details, such as saving the original file format or changing the page layout, generally end up using Microsoft Word. MS Word does not contain the Print Preview feature, but many teachers and readers prefer Word over WordPad because it has more flexibility and capability. However, if you wish to print with Word, you must first create a new document (instructions), then convert it to Word format.

3) ""Can I read in MS\nA?""

Students who can read well should feel free to use MS\nA, even if they're learning the program for the first time. Some MS\nA users enjoy using MS\nA because of its unique look-and-feel. A few times a year, we'll hold a special event where students can share experiences with others while learning about MS\nA.

1) In a patient with chronic migraine, the patient's headaches are usually not controlled by over-the-counter pain relievers or medications such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium or aspirin (table 1). The headache may be associated with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and/or cognitive problems that have been present for months or years. A recent history of migraines and a family history of migraine is necessary in order to determine if medication therapy should be started. An abnormal neurologic examination or electroencephalogram can indicate if the patient has had an underlying problem or event(s) causing neurological changes.

2) Patients who report having only one type of headache and no other neurologic abnormalities (headache without aura or dizziness without loss of consciousness), may benefit from a trial of the triptan drug lansoprazole as monotherapy or with an NSAID. Alternatively, patients with migraine with aura could use a combination of the following three drugs: naproxen sodium plus the triptan; zonisamide plus the triptan; and cimetidine plus the triptan. For some patients, these three drugs combined might produce relief more rapidly than would either treatment alone. However, the triptan drug combination is probably preferred, because it requires fewer doses per day and produces a lower incidence of adverse effects than does a single triptan drug.

3) Antibiotics can alleviate the clinical signs and symptoms associated with MRSA infection of the inner ear. Although antibiotic therapy is contraindicated in individuals at risk for developing ear infections, its beneficial effect on the frequency of daily headache attacks has been shown in several studies (see ""Possible Use"" above). Aspirin or indomethacin can decrease the frequency and severity of migraine attacks during the course of the antibiotic therapy. Some research suggests that the side effect profile of the antibiotics taken after meningitis or meningococcal disease may be similar to those seen in migraine headaches. Thus, caution is advised when prescribing any antibacterial agents for migraine patients who do not require regular visits to their primary care physician.

4) In a study involving a cohort of individuals with migraine and postherpetic neuralgia, treatment with ibuprofen plus acetaminophen reduced the frequency and duration of migraine attacks for all participants compared with placebo (61",68,List of multiple sclerosis symptoms,-9.499794960021973,161,q,2,0.7285067873303167,371,16
gpt2-xl_57,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory demyelinating disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. It has an average survival rate of less than 10 years in developed countries; it can last for decades or even longer in developing countries. The disease starts with acute relapses that usually occur once or twice each month. After more months, some people develop secondary progressive MS, which begins when lesions progress to become permanent. In addition, patients with active relapsing-remitting MS may have neuropathic pain, muscle weakness, fatigue, dizziness, and numbness or tingling in their limbs, although these symptoms are not life threatening.B:

The condition is caused by damage to white matter tracts and axons throughout the brain. These tracts and axons transmit signals from one part of your body to another, allowing you to move and function normally.

C:

Your doctor will conduct a thorough physical examination and perform blood tests to look for signs of other medical conditions. Your family physician may refer you to other specialists who specialize in this area such as neurologists, radiologists, ophthalmologists, and psychiatrists.

D:

Your doctor's primary goal is to identify any underlying causes of MS and find out how they affect the progression of the disease. They will also evaluate your response to treatment and monitor how well you respond to medications. If your medical history shows other possible risk factors for MS, your doctor may recommend genetic testing for your susceptibility.

E:

Many different types of research studies have been conducted on MS since its discovery in the late 19th century. These studies include clinical trials (called ""phase I"" trials), observational studies (called ""phase II""), prospective cohort studies, and small randomized controlled trials. Each type of study has its own strengths and weaknesses. Researchers use several criteria to decide which one to follow first in order to determine whether a medication works best. For example, phase II trial participants take the drug for approximately three months and then see if they experience improvement over time. This strategy allows researchers to compare the effects of drugs against those of placebo treatments.

F:

There are currently no approved drugs designed specifically to treat MS. However, there are several types of therapies that help reduce inflammation that leads to nerve damage. These include corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory agents (like NSAIDs and acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin), and nutritional supplements like vitamins A, C, E",57,multiple sclerosis stages phases,-3.7379088401794434,5,q,2,0.024154589371980676,397,2
gpt2-xl_86,"Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.

[0116] Q: What is the difference between secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and primary progressive multiple sclerosis? A: Primary progressive MS occurs first, but there are some important differences. [0117] Q: Why do many people have signs of both? A: It's not unusual for a patient with one to develop symptoms later in life as well, which may be related to inflammation or other factors that are independent from the disease process. [0118] Q: When does a person become symptomatic after having been diagnosed with secondary progressive MS? A: The risk of being affected by secondary progressive MS increases dramatically when the disease has progressed to the point where it affects daily activities such as walking. [0119] Q: How can I tell if I've developed signs of secondary progressive MS? A: There will usually be an increase in your body mass index (BMI) at puberty. If you're underweight at this time, you may need more weight loss before your BMI drops back down to normal. Also, the type of physical activity you do will determine whether you progress further into secondary progressive MS. For example, those who spend most of their days sitting, especially if they wear wheelchairs, may experience less rapid progression into secondary progressive MS. You'll need to make decisions about how much exercise and what types of activity you do to keep your condition stable. [0120] Q: Where can I find out more information about secondary progressive MS? A: More information about MS treatment, including symptom management, is available through the National Multiple Sclerosis Society on its website.

gpt2-xl_93,"Yes, MS is a disorder that causes the brain to lose its ability to process information properly. As a result, it often does not send out signals to tell your body when you are tired or needs rest (this can lead to an extended period of sleepiness). The most common symptom for people with MS is trouble falling asleep. Other symptoms include headaches, fatigue, pain on one side of the head, and trouble focusing. \r


Q: How do I know if my MS affects my ability to get up at night?\nA: A study conducted by the National Sleep Foundation found that more than half of adults who have MS also suffer from insomnia. People with MS may be unable to wake up at the same time each day because they cannot function as well during the daytime. This may be exacerbated in people who also experience chronic pain due to nerve damage. It's important to take a regular nighttime pill to help manage this problem. While taking naps will make you feel better throughout the day, it won't necessarily fix the underlying cause of your insomnia. \r


Q: What are some other factors that increase risk of developing MS?\nA: Another reason why people develop MS is an abnormal immune system response. An abnormal immune response increases inflammation and damages nerve cells causing them to die. In addition, certain viruses or bacteria called coxsackievirus B1 and B2 may trigger autoimmune reactions to build up in the nervous system leading to MS. One study shows that a type of coxsackievirus called JC virus is associated with an increased risk of developing MS. Other studies show that exposure to air pollution may contribute to MS development, but further research is needed to determine whether air pollution itself could play a role in the disease. Finally, there is increasing evidence that people with MS tend to eat unhealthy diets, such as fatty meat and high-sugar drinks, which might reduce the levels of vitamin D in their blood. Some experts believe diet may be just as important as medications in helping control the disease.


Q: Does eating gluten affect the course of MS?\nA: Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, barley, and oats. Studies show that people who have celiac disease, a disorder caused by an intolerance to gluten, are twice as likely to develop MS compared to people who don't have celiac disease. However, another study showed no link between celiac disease and MS. Also, some doctors believe that gluten sensitivity or intestinal infections (such as UTIs",93,Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?,-0.0187324248254299,2,q,2,0.010101010101010102,424,34
gpt2-xl_72,"The primary benefit of the CVSV-19 vaccination is to protect against the rabies virus. However, because other vaccines may be administered in addition to the CVSV-19 vaccine (e.g., hepatitis B, hepatitis A and/or Haemophilus influenzae type b [Hib] seronegative), it is not always possible to determine which vaccine has been given as a part of a combined regimen with additional therapies. If you are receiving multiple sclerosis medications that include daclizumab, valganciclovir or famciclovir, please contact your doctor prior to administration of the CVSV-19 vaccine.

Q: What should I do if my child receives the CVSV-19 vaccine but develops an adverse reaction after immunization?

A: In most cases, the vaccine will cause only mild reactions within 3 months of vaccination. There have also been reports of severe reactions such as encephalitis following vaccinations, so families should monitor their children's health closely during this time. Parents should report all adverse events to CDC by calling 1-800-CDC-INFO, visiting www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adverseevents.htm or reporting on the VAERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov/.

Q: How long does the vaccine stay in the body?

The vaccine can remain in the body up to 4 weeks. It is important to note that some people develop a temporary soreness or rash on their skin at the site where they were vaccinated. This is called an erythema migrans. Other symptoms may occur, including fever, muscle aches, headache and backache. Please see the Vaccine Safety Information provided above for more information about the vaccine.

Q: Will there be a vaccine shortage?

Yes, vaccine supplies have become limited. Therefore, manufacturers are now producing new batches of these products. Because the production schedule is unpredictable, there could be shortages in the future. Some vaccine manufacturers have already begun issuing recall notices for unopened lots of these vaccines. Please read any FDA vaccine alert regarding a vaccine shortage or recall.",72,Is the Covid-19 vaccine safe for people taking multiple sclerosis drugs?,-0.0332547165453434,28,q,2,0.13145539906103287,304,39
gpt2-xl_79,"Yes, MS is hereditary and passes from parent to child. It can also be passed on through the blood system. There are several ways to pass it on, such as being exposed to certain drugs or having a close relative with a genetic mutation that makes them more likely to develop MS. People who have been diagnosed with MS should talk with their doctors about any possible risks of passing MS on to children.

Q: Will my doctor know if I had a brain tumor? A: Your doctor will ask you questions about your medical history. If he/she knows something about your personal history and finds the diagnosis suspicious, they may refer you for testing at an accredited neurology center. Some centers have protocols in place to screen people before allowing them to get a CT scan (electroencephalogram) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), which reveal lesions that might be present in the brain. However, many patients with suspected or confirmed brain tumors are not referred for these tests until after the first treatment course. The same is true when trying to find out whether MS is causing the brain tumors; you do not need to undergo additional scans or treatments until the first course of therapy is complete. In some cases, symptoms occur in conjunction with the onset of tumors that may not be detected until months later, even years after the initial diagnosis. Also, because there is no standard way to diagnose these conditions, physicians often perform different types of diagnostic procedures on each person, sometimes leading to confusion and potentially inaccurate results. For example, some doctors use magnetic resonance images to look for MRIs in the brain but use computed tomography (CTs) for neurological exams or blood work. Other doctors use PET scans to view the metabolism of red blood cells. These differences may lead to misdiagnosis and incorrect treatment recommendations.

Q: What happens if someone has MS and then develops a brain tumor? Do I really have brain cancer? A: Yes. Brain cancers usually grow slowly over time; however, the rate varies widely depending on the type and location of the tumor. Early-stage noncancerous brain tumors can become malignant and spread throughout the body. This can cause death by respiratory failure. Later stages of cancer, such as gliomas and meningiomas, have much slower growth rates and generally don't require surgery to remove them. Although most people recover fully from this condition, some people develop long-term problems, including speech loss, depression, impaired memory, Parkinson's disease symptoms, or dementia.",79,Can I pass multiple sclerosis to other family members?,-0.0328906141221523,0,q,2,0.0,420,22

Cancer risk factors that increase the likelihood of receiving a high-risk biopsy; these are not included as part of our model but can be used to evaluate how much additional information we have on each patient's specific risk. In addition, some of these risk factors include a history of recurrent cancer (including advanced prostate cancer), high BMI, diabetes mellitus, family history of breast cancer, history of testicular germ cell tumors, low IGF binding protein 3 or 5, serum ALT level, and serum lipids (ie, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL). These risk factors do not necessarily increase the risk of recurrence; however, they may result from an increased incidence of new cancers over time, which could influence future treatments.

Question 4: How much do you know about this?

A: I am aware that the disease can affect people from different ethnic groups; for example, there is a small amount of evidence suggesting an association with Ashkenazi Jews and lower risk of developing MS. However, we are trying to understand what this means in terms of overall risk of developing MS in different racial/ethnic populations [ref ].


The best way to learn more about your individualized treatment plan might be to contact your doctor or an MS support group. To find out if you have any existing symptoms of MS, ask your health care provider. You may want to consider taking tests to check for MS such as these:

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) test

Blood test for antibodies against B-cell leukemia (BCL-2) and CCR5

Treatment of MS: What do we mean by ""treatment""?


In general, we refer to treatments used for the treatment of MS as ""medications."" These include:

Medication to slow the progression of MS

Medicines to treat MS symptoms

Therapies designed to help control the symptoms of MS

Medical devices intended to treat MS

We also offer medications and therapies developed by researchers at the National Institute on Aging and other institutions to treat MS. Because these are new drugs and cannot currently be patented, they must be purchased through insurance companies without cost sharing or benefit eligibility requirements. For more information on how these medicines work and their benefits, please see Medication Guide for People With Multiple Sclerosis: Treatments and Devices.


How does one take the medication described above?


If you are prescribed any medication, follow all directions exactly as instructed by your physician. Do not stop using any medication without first talking to your healthcare provider. If needed, start treatment after completing 7 consecutive days of taking the medicine (this will usually occur within 10 to 14 days). Follow all directions precisely, including dosage, frequency, length, and frequency of doses. Never double dose. When you stop taking one medication, do not begin taking another medication at the same time. Do not change your dosing schedule or frequency or try to cut down or quit your medication suddenly. This could cause side effects or make it harder to quit. The most common side effect associated with stopping or changing medications is weight gain.

I am not here to tell you that these are all symptoms. They may be different signs, but they're all related to your body's response to stress. So what can we do about it? It is important to understand how much stress we put on our bodies when we engage in activities like running long distances, for example. This will help us determine whether we need to get some exercise so that our bodies have more time to heal. If we continue to run long distances without giving our bodies enough rest, we'll undoubtedly suffer from injuries.

If you find yourself with chronic anxiety problems, you might want to consider talking to a physical therapist who specializes in treating individuals suffering from chronic anxiety disorders. Physical therapists work closely with their patients to prevent and treat chronic conditions, such as arthritis, headaches, and depression. Your mental health care professional will also assist you with managing your overall stress levels, including learning coping strategies that allow you to remain calm during stressful situations. In fact, many people feel better after working through psychological exercises like mindfulness meditation.

When it comes to preventing and treating chronic conditions, it is often difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of an illness. That being said, there are a number of things you can try, starting right now! You don't have to go it alone! By following the tips below, you will likely improve your quality of life and eliminate your anxiety symptoms.

Get Plenty of Sleep

Sleep deprivation is one of the biggest killers of humans. Not only does sleep deprive your brain cells of vital nutrients, it can also impair memory. When your mind isn't able to process information at night properly, you experience vivid dreams. But instead of sleeping in terror, it is possible to prevent nightmares by getting adequate sleep each night. According to The Huffington Post, getting eight hours of uninterrupted sleep per night is enough to keep you awake longer than someone who gets just four. In addition, it helps regulate mood and reduces irritability. Getting plenty of rest throughout the day is another good way to reduce anxiety. Keep track of your total daily sleep time each week. Make sure you are getting enough sleep, especially between 7 p.m. and 8 a.m.

Pilot studies of chemotherapy and HER-2 mutation status in breast cancer survivors

The most recent pilot study was conducted as part of the CAR-T clinical trial led by Dr. Vipin Parekh [14]. It involved 101 adult women with breast cancer and an original positive Herceptin® result from a mammogram. The investigators had initially hypothesized that those who developed Herceptin®-positive tumors were more likely to develop breast cancer recurrence compared to those who did not have a positive HER2-result on their initial mammograms. They followed this up with a second study to determine if HER2-mutant patients in this cohort also experienced increased rates of breast cancer recurrence. This latter study confirmed these findings. Although the overall rate of recurrence for HER2-mutants is only 15% versus 40%-60%, in HER2-negative cohorts it can be as much as 60%. Thus there is strong evidence that certain cancers are caused by mutations in one or both copies of HER2, which may predispose them to development of other types of cancer or even cancer recurrence.

2nd-place winning diet

This is a low fat, high fiber vegetarian diet with an emphasis on fresh fruit and vegetables. It also contains a variety of legumes, grains, nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils.


The primary goals are to reduce total caloric intake (1,700 calories per day) and body weight (13 pounds). The other goals include increasing exercise frequency, improving micronutrient status, reducing stress levels, avoiding alcohol and tobacco use, eating less meat and dairy, and limiting consumption of animal products, in order to maximize health benefits for participants.

3rd place winning diet

In this diet, individuals would reduce their daily calorie intake to 1,000 calories per day and increase physical activity by 50 percent (or 30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise 3 times per week). The goal would be to achieve a healthy BMI, as well as a healthy blood pressure, cholesterol level, and blood sugar profile; maintain a good dietary pattern consisting of whole foods rich in plant foods; avoid sugars; limit saturated fats and trans fats, while maintaining adequate protein; and obtain adequate vitamin B12.

4th place winning diet

These diets are very similar to the first two but focus more heavily on fruit and vegetables. They contain about 100 to 150 grams of fruits and vegetables each day (depending on the person's needs), and a minimum amount of lean meats (a little over 2 ounces per day). Participants would also eat at least 15 percent extra of plants per day, including leafy greens such as spinach, kale, collard greens, bok choy, mustard greens, celery, broccoli, watercress, etc.

5th place winning diet

Many people who participate in these diets have trouble losing weight or keeping it off after they start. In contrast, many successful people on these diets say that if they had not followed them they would not be where they are today. However, those following these diets generally need to follow these diets for several years before achieving a sustained weight loss.

Why do some diets work and others don't?

The reason that certain diets seem to work better than others has nothing to do with how much you consume of the specific food group. There is no single recipe for success. Rather, it comes down to the type of diet you're trying to change your lifestyle and habits around.

gpt2-xl_53,"In my opinion, it's a type of therapy that you can use to help someone with their depression. A person might have been depressed for the last six months or so and has no hope in finding relief. After some time of trying various things (depression pills), taking medication (anti-depressants) and not being able to find relief, they decide that maybe there's something wrong with them. They go through a few sessions of psychotherapy. The purpose of this type of therapy is to try to get to know themselves better. Some people just want to talk about their feelings and don't really care much how they're going to do it. Other people are more interested in learning about themselves as individuals. You should feel free to ask questions. Most people will give you honest answers without giving up too many details that may make them uncomfortable. However, if your therapist gives you advice that you feel is inappropriate, then be aware that he or she might be guilty of abuse. I would think that anyone who tells you how to live your life is potentially abusive, but even when the counselor does not say anything outright, one has to keep an eye out for any clues. I have heard many stories from people who were abused by therapists who gave them bad advice. If a counselor tries to convince you that you need to change your attitude and actions, I would think that he/she is abusing his/her position and has violated ethical standards. \nB: Why did you choose this field?\mA: I have always enjoyed psychology. It brings me joy to see people smile at their children or hear a child laugh. Also, psychology provides a very unique experience.

People tend to look down upon those who study other fields because they seem to be stuck doing the same old thing. Psychology is different. There is nothing stagnant about psychology. I enjoy seeing the growth in our students, particularly undergrads. This makes me happy; it means that we are continuing to grow. It also forces us to continually push ourselves. We can't rest on our laurels. There isn't much room for mistakes, especially in graduate school. Our students are like little monkeys that are constantly having to learn new things.

He had been prescribed a low dose oral preparation containing Ciprofloxacin (CIP) (1 mg) as part of his routine care for recurrent acute pancreatitis. After 2 weeks he developed a severe acute pancreatitis and died at hospital on Day 7 (21 May 2009) due to massive fluid resuscitation and shock. [0002] 2. This is the second reported case of acute intravascular pancreatitis in association with the use of Ciprofloxacin (CIP). The first case occurred in 1991 when a 19 year old woman presenting to hospital had developed a complication of acute pancreatitis caused by Ciprofloxacin (3 g orally twice a day). She developed haemorrhagic shock and death 4 hours after admission. At autopsy her pancreas was found to be severely necrotic and there were numerous intra-abdominal abscesses, which had subsequently spread throughout the abdomen. In addition she suffered from peritonitis, sepsis, haemolysis, and renal failure. There are no data regarding the incidence of this adverse event in patients receiving ciprofloxacin (3 g orally twice a day). These cases highlight the need for caution with oral preparations containing Ciprofloxacin (CIP) because of possible serious complications and deaths. [0003] F.

Q: What is the difference between a ""cough"" and an ""asthma attack""?

A: A cough or wheeze may occur as part of the respiratory system (a symptom). If you feel like you're having one, it's probably because your airways are congested. Aspirations should be managed carefully as they can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia, obstruction, scarring, lung damage, and even death.

An asthma attack, also called an asthma attack, usually occurs when your lungs become irritated by something that causes them to expand or contract. These attacks often occur suddenly and without warning. Some examples of potential triggers include exposure to pollen, allergens, dust mites, household chemicals, smoke from fireplaces and automobiles, stress, coughing or sneezing, cold air, and hot/humid weather. Because people with asthma are at increased risk for developing breathing problems, these symptoms may last longer than typical asthma attacks.

For more details about what happens during an asthma attack, please refer to Asthma Attacks: What Happens?.

Q: Which medication do I take if I have asthma?

A: You need to make sure you get enough oxygen through the right type of inhaler. The following recommendations cover common types of inhalers:

Oxygen Intensive Asthmatic Airway Support

Intra-nasal inhalers

Oral (sniffable) inhalers

Sinus prongs (for children under 6 years old)

Subglottic devices (for adults over age 60)

Percutaneous airway support devices (including PAPRs)

Introduction There has been a recent increase in interest in treatments for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly among patients with asthma [1]. Recently, evidence emerged suggesting that several drugs used to treat asthma might be useful in COPD and therefore can improve patient outcomes [2], [3], including nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), the precursor of butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors, which can reduce inflammatory cytokines and oxygen demand by altering endothelial nitric oxide production [4]–[6]. NDGA was first identified as having antiinflammatory activity against human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro [7], [",109,ehlers danlos syndrome POTS nausea stomach pain,-10.201836585998535,26,q,3,0.65,273,0

Dr. S.: What kind of treatments can you offer patients?

Patient 1: Most often they just need some physical therapy, but there is also medication that might be needed for their conditions such as nerve damage, muscle paralysis or loss of vision. They usually start off on a low dose of medications before slowly increasing it over time. In addition, we talk about nutrition and supplementation.

Dr. S.: How much does an average patient spend per month on MS drugs?

Patient 2: Some spend up to $2,000 a month while others only spend half that amount. However, if they go down the ""low-dose"" route, one third will spend less than $100 a month, two thirds may spend no more than $200 a month, and five percent will pay nothing at all.

Dr. S.: What kinds of tests do you use?

Patient 2: We screen every new patient through MRIs and EEGs (electroencephalograms) since the disease progresses rapidly.

Dr. S.: Who are your biggest clients and how long did you work with them?

Patients 3 and 4: Both suffered from progressive degenerative disc problems. They were initially prescribed antibiotics and steroids but found that they had very serious side effects, such as constipation, hair loss, fatigue, dizziness, depression, insomnia, diarrhea, skin rashes and weight gain. Because these symptoms occurred so frequently, they decided to stop using these medications and went back to their traditional treatment plan consisting mainly of acupuncture, diet modification and walking. Each patient was followed for 12 months, which showed remarkable improvement, even though many side effects returned. Their doctors suggested a small dose of oral statin drugs that could keep the benefits without the side effects. Patients 5 and 6 both suffer from severe neuropathy caused by multiple sclerosis. After the first few sessions, they experienced significant improvements and after eight sessions, they said they felt completely normal again, despite having to walk with a cane for three years. These cases proved to us that the medications used to treat MS and other diseases should be adjusted according to individual needs",83,Why get episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis?,-9.616371154785156,163,q,3,0.6965811965811965,411,27

gpt2-xl_77,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects the central nervous system, causing lesions in myelin sheaths and nerve fibers. It is a chronic, relapsing disorder that affects women over the age of 50. A number of MS patients have been diagnosed with a form of early-onset MS called primary progressive MS. Menopause occurs around age 45, which means that most women with MS who are postmenopausal at diagnosis will be diagnosed as having pre-MS. The main symptom of both MS and PCS is pain. Pain caused by other conditions or medications can cause similar symptoms. Some people experience only one type of migraine headache during their lifetime. Other people may experience two different types of headaches, each lasting for less than three months, or migraines that start in adolescence but stop by adulthood. Migraine attacks may also affect a person's sleep, mood, energy level, concentration, strength and ability to drive, work and perform everyday activities such as eating, walking and dressing. In addition, MS patients often notice that they feel tired more frequently and lose their appetite. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, depending on the severity of the underlying condition. Sometimes people report not feeling well enough to go out without help. People who are unable to work or participate fully in social activities might find it difficult to manage finances, make new friends, get married, or raise children. They might even decide to stop working altogether. Many factors contribute to these symptoms, including fatigue caused by physical work or emotional stress, changes in hormone levels due to changes in pregnancy or menopause, infection, anemia, inflammation, injury or surgery, or depression. Menopause usually causes the menstrual cycle to slow down, leading to heavier flow and cramping that may last up to six weeks before menstruation resumes. During this time, a woman should continue to take her medication regularly because some medicines may prevent the body from properly making estrogen. If there has been a recent change in diet or lifestyle, it can disrupt the balance between hormones, causing problems with estrogen production. However, any changes in diet or lifestyle should be carefully monitored. As a result of a change in diet or lifestyle, it may be necessary to adjust your treatment regimen if you already have PCS or MS. Some health care providers prescribe a combination of estrogen plus progestin to treat both MS and PCS symptoms. This method of using estrogen together with oral contraceptives (birth control pills) has been shown to be safe when used safely.

""\u201cThe causes of hunger, poverty, undernutrition and other nutritional deficiencies can vary greatly from country to country, region to region, and from one part of the world to another. To some extent, these problems may also reflect differences in the level of technology available to each nation. In this regard, there are many examples where countries which are less dependent upon agriculture (e.g., India, Iran) are able to improve their standards of living through technological innovations such as the use of irrigation and better seed varieties. And countries which have become more technologically advanced (e.g., China) have been able to increase levels of income for their citizens.\pH: 7.3-7.4\r

\u201cIn order for any nation to meet its basic needs, it must first eliminate extreme poverty. The development of agricultural technologies throughout the world is necessary because farmers need tools such as tractors, harvesters, fertilizers and pesticides to grow crops efficiently. However, it is not enough merely to provide farmers with the necessary equipment. Many farmers still rely heavily on local labor and on subsistence farming techniques that require little training. This is especially true in rural areas where families depend on traditional practices and few opportunities exist for learning new skills. Therefore, even if agricultural technology advances have improved yields and productivity, they will not overcome the economic difficulties faced by millions of farmers across the globe.\u2014\u2014 \r


""\u2015\r

To solve the issue of hunger, we must promote universal access to modern farming techniques, education and training. This requires government policies that support sustainable agricultural production systems based on good science rather than tradition, and ensure that all farmers receive equal access to affordable fertilizer and seeds. It also requires governments to establish free and accessible markets that enable private investment in agriculture and ensure fair trade conditions within these markets.",1,What are the most common chronic diseases?

Q: I'm having trouble sleeping. Can you help? A: The best thing to do if you're experiencing trouble falling asleep is try using an alarm clock with light or sound. Some people even use electronic devices such as cell phones and computers when they want to go to sleep. Do not drink alcohol before bedtime because it reduces your ability to fall asleep, so it's important that you have plenty of water on hand. It may take some time for your body to adjust to new routines after a period of sleep deprivation, but most adults feel much better once they've gone through an extended period of sleep deprivation. Please see our Sleep Resources page for more information about improving your sleep quality.

Q: How long should I expect my wisdom teeth to last? A: Your dentist will recommend a maximum duration of 4 years (5 if you are younger than age 12). However, all teeth are subject to decay over time so in general we suggest you keep your wisdom teeth until you're between ages 8 and 13.

Q: Does my child need a fluoride treatment? A: Fluoride treatments help prevent cavities in children by inhibiting the growth of bacteria in the gums.

There are many ways to measure blood sugar and it can also vary by how long you have had diabetes, your current medication status or the type of diabetes treatment you are taking. If you think there may be some problems with a ketogenic / keto diet, speak to your doctor about your options. A good resource for more information on this subject is www.askthenutritionist.com/diet-and-nutrition/diabetes/.

What should I watch out for during a ketogenic / keto diet?

The key point here is not to worry too much if you experience any side effects, even those that don't last very long. It's best to see an experienced dietitian (or physician) before making any changes in your diet. Side effects such as headaches and fatigue are common when low carbohydrate diets are changed, but usually subside within 2 months and are not considered dangerous. For many people, these issues do not appear until the end of the first month and they tend to resolve themselves without intervention. Some people find that their hair becomes thinner. This is due to the increased amount of water that is lost during a fast. As well, it's possible to develop other health conditions as a result of a low carb or keto lifestyle, so always consult your doctor if you notice anything unusual.

In addition to these short term health concerns, there are also longer-term consequences to the high fat diet you are following. Your brain will continue to use up glucose from fatty tissues until you're able to burn protein sparingly. In time, your brain cells may start to shrink.

BODY WEIGHT: Body weight is the measure of how much an individual weighs. The body mass index (BMI), which can be calculated from height and weight, is used to assess obesity in people who are overweight. BMI ranges from 20 to 25. A healthy range for men is 18.5 to 24.9 and 21.1 to 24.6 for women. Obesity is defined as having a BMI of 30 or higher for a person's age and gender.

EATING CONDITIONS: People with diabetes are at increased risk for developing heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, and kidney problems. Other conditions associated with obesity include gallstones, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, and certain cancers.

DIABETES: Diabetes affects 1 in 4 American adults. When diagnosed early enough, the condition can often be managed successfully. But if it's not caught soon, diabetes can cause severe damage to both your kidneys and heart. About 15 percent of adults with type 2 diabetes will develop complications such as kidney failure within 10 years of being diagnosed. This means that you may need treatment with dialysis to keep your kidneys working properly. Your doctor can help find out if you're at risk and whether you should undergo dialysis.

MUSCLE PROBLEMS: Weight gain during adulthood can lead to a variety of muscle injuries, including those that occur when muscles stretch too much or break down because of changes in your diet or exercise habits. These injuries can lead to pain, discomfort, and even permanent disability.

WOMEN WITH CHOLESTIC DISEASE (CHD): Cholestasis occurs when bacteria builds up in the digestive tract and can block digestion. Cholestasis can happen to anyone at any time, but it becomes particularly dangerous for people with Type 2 diabetes and premenopausal women who already have high cholesterol levels, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. If you have cholestasis, there is no cure but lifestyle changes like reducing intake of solid fats and increasing fiber intake can improve symptoms.

This may cause you difficulty in walking and running, as well as other activities that require balance and coordination. Although MS is not curable, early treatment can help improve symptoms and lead to a more complete recovery.


If symptoms become worse, see your doctor or neurologist for a medical evaluation. You may be referred to an MS specialist, such as a neurologist.

Preventing MS by Keeping Healthy While Having Multiple Sclerosis

You have several health benefits from living with MS and keeping healthy while having multiple sclerosis. For example, research shows that MS can decrease your risk of getting heart disease, cancer, stroke, kidney problems, osteoporosis (low bone density), depression, and even diabetes later in life. Some people who are at higher risk of MS also have a lower risk of developing heart attacks, strokes, kidney diseases, breast cancers, ovarian cancer, gallbladder disorders, prostate cancer, and other cancers and heart disease. In addition, some studies indicate that those with MS have better sleep patterns than people without MS.

While it's impossible to predict how long this type of study might last, recent evidence suggests that MS doesn't affect everyone equally, although many people develop new symptoms with time. The treatments that make sense when treating MS patients aren't always effective when treating people with MS without the condition. There's no reason to stop taking these drugs unless you want to. It just means you need to take them correctly. If your neurologist prescribes certain medications or therapies for you, they may be helpful if used properly. But don't ignore important questions about what other medicines you should avoid and whether you're overmedicating yourself.",94,When will I start to feel better with multiple sclerosis?,-1.4442681074142456,12,q,3,0.05660377358490566,285,15

Q: what are the symptoms?\nA: bleeding, abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting or constipation; high blood pressure. Q: can you tell me more about how to tell if it's an ectopic pregnancy?\nA: most commonly, it is diagnosed by ultrasound examination (which shows a tube resembling an egg). In cases where other tests show that the embryo has already formed inside the uterus, a fetal echocardiogram may be helpful in determining the type of pregnancy. If your health care provider suspects that the pregnancy is ectopic, he or she may prescribe medicines such as folic acid, iron-containing supplements (including vitamin B12), and antibiotics. For many women with chronic infection, medications such as doxycycline, clindamycin, moxifloxacin, tetracyclines, and erythromycin are prescribed for one or all of their children. A woman who takes an antibiotic to treat her bacterial vaginosis will be able to become pregnant again without having to take oral contraceptives while taking this medication. Q: which prenatal tests should I get?\nA: You'll want to have an ultrasound scan at least three weeks before you start trying to conceive so that the baby's heart rate, breathing pattern, and blood chemistry can be monitored during the first week of life. If you're not sure whether the test was positive or negative, ask your healthcare provider. It's best to wait until after the test for the results but even then they may only indicate that there is no danger of the baby's developing serious illness. The next step involves getting pregnant. Because some babies are born preterm, early interventions may be necessary to help ensure the health of both mother and child. Q: does my body need vitamins or minerals from food?\nA: Yes, pregnant women often require dietary supplements containing folate, calcium, zinc, and copper. These nutrients help increase the amount of red blood cells and oxygenated blood, allowing more oxygen to reach the fetus' brain and muscles. Foods rich in iron include beef and chicken; nuts and vegetables contain iron as well; legumes and soybeans contain iron; whole grains generally provide iron, although barley and rye may also offer significant amounts; fish is high in iron.

2) ""The Daily Activity App,"" by Mark Williams, is the only app with a health section. It's designed to help you stay motivated through your day. The app helps you track and quantify how much sleep you get each night (if you don't get enough, you can use it as an alarm clock!), which helps you adjust your sleeping patterns to suit your needs. If you have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, this may be something you'd like to keep in mind. You can also set goals for when you want to go to bed so that you won't be too late. And if you're getting up early on a weekday morning, you'll find that you wake up earlier and more rested! I especially love the fact that you can set different activities for specific days of the week. For instance, I will try to do some walking and running during my lunch break when the gym isn't open but I'm not exercising at all. This way I can still eat healthy and get protein from foods I enjoy without being punished. I guess I could also include a workout routine too but then I wouldn't need to worry about the calories and calories out (which is quite important!).

I used the app the first time I started tracking my physical activity. Now I can't imagine my life without it. I see myself using it every day (except weekends), except when I'm doing chores around the house. 🙂

The answer is yes, the treatment has been shown to be effective in treating MS and other neurological conditions such as ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease).

When used together with drugs called TMS or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), it can help control symptoms, improve overall quality of life and extend a patient's life expectancy. However, there are drawbacks as well, according to Dr. William Kupferberg, director of medical research at the University of California San Francisco, who wrote an editorial about the study published by JAMA Neurology on Monday.

""Most people with chronic pain have no known underlying neurologic deficits that could account for their condition,"" he said in an email. ""Treatment with these medications may affect the brain."" The treatments use electrical currents to target specific areas of the brain. That means they can be used to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, but also other disorders such as diabetes, epilepsy and depression. Although the devices do not cause damage to nerve cells, they still affect how neurons function.

Kupferberg added that since it is not clear what causes MS, the best course of action remains unknown.

Still, the findings provide hope for millions of Americans suffering from MS and those diagnosed with other neurological conditions. Researchers noted that the results do not apply exclusively to patients with MS. Those with any neurological disorder should consider trying one of these treatments.",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-8.70691967010498,56,q,3,0.27450980392156865,238,0
gpt2-xl_54,"Multiple sclerosis is the most common type of neurologic disease, affecting more than 1.2 million Americans. The course and severity of MS varies greatly from person to person, but there are three stages. In stage I, people with MS experience problems with balance, vision or speech. Sometimes they lose their sense of smell, taste or touch; at other times, they have severe difficulty swallowing. In stage II, a person may lose ability to move in all ways, including walking, seeing, hearing, talking or thinking clearly. At this point, people may start having problems breathing (bronchiectasis) or develop damage to nerve cells that controls muscles. Stage III includes all cases. Symptoms can range from mild to disabling. If you are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis as an adult, you will be evaluated by your physician for any symptoms you might have developed during the previous 12 months, which could indicate the onset of MS. For some people with MS, there is no need for further evaluation. People who do not receive appropriate treatment often become disabled within five years of diagnosis. Other disorders that can affect multiple sclerosis symptoms include stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease.

Eating disorders are also common. Eating disorders are characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating, disordered eating behavior, restrictive dieting or weight loss. They typically begin before puberty and continue into adulthood. Many people with eating disorders have some level of functioning in everyday life. However, many others suffer from serious health consequences due to poor mental health and social well-being. One in five women (20 percent) report binge eating in her lifetime, compared to one in 20 men (5 percent). More than 40 percent of female adolescents (ages 15–19) suffer from binge eating disorder. Women are affected 2–3 times more frequently than men (4 percent vs 2 percent). Binge eating can lead to significant emotional distress, low self esteem, depression and anxiety disorders. About 50 percent of patients with bulimia nervosa have co-occurring eating disorders. These disorders usually begin between age 14 and 18. A survey conducted by UCLA found that about 25 percent of teenagers had been involved in a food-related activity that resulted in damage to their body. Nearly half of those surveyed said they were bullied because of their weight.

Other conditions that are associated with severe psychological distress include substance abuse, eating disorder symptoms, sleep disturbances and mood swings. Some people who have experienced mental illness do not go on to develop other chronic medical conditions. However, some chronic physical conditions may also occur in individuals who have been diagnosed with a mental health disorder.

What is the treatment for BPD?

For most people with Borderline Personality Disorder, there are effective treatments available. Treatment may be brief (with a short course of psychotherapy) or long term (long term psychopharmacological and behavioral therapies). Patients can also benefit from medication (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRI's] or tricyclic antidepressants[TCAs]) in addition to psychotherapy. Medication should always be used carefully to avoid adverse effects on both the patient and the caregiver.

What is Hypothyroidism?

Hypothyroidism is an underactive thyroid gland that can lead to a number of serious complications including heart failure and depression. It affects millions of people around the world, especially women, because many do not receive adequate treatment.

Symptoms include fatigue, weight loss, lack of energy and feeling cold. These symptoms can lead to sleep disturbances, muscle weakness, poor coordination, memory issues, and difficulty concentrating. In some cases, hypothyroidism causes severe problems with blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, sweating, and cognitive function. The symptoms usually begin within the first few years after diagnosis.

If you have hypothyroidism, you will need regular treatment for life. Your doctor will work with your family physician to determine if there are any other contributing factors to this condition.

How Common Is Hypothyroidism?

The majority of people are born without a functioning thyroid gland. If it is too small, it cannot produce enough hormones needed by the body. However, there are several types of hypothyroidism. Symptoms can vary from mild to life threatening.

Primary Hypothyroidism

This type of hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid produces abnormal amounts of hormones, but the brain does not recognize them as being abnormal. This condition is often called ""primary"" or ""latent."" Primary hypothyroidism is associated with decreased fertility, breast cancer risk and heart disease risk. About 1 out of every 100 babies worldwide has primary hypothyroidism.

In the United States alone, over 2 million adults are estimated to be living with hypothyroidism, while another 30 million children and teens have the condition.

Secondary Hypothyroidism

Some people inherit a less effective version of the thyroid hormone than normal, resulting in secondary hypothyroidism. This causes an abnormally high amount of thyroid hormone to be produced, causing health problems like high cholesterol and",123,hypothyroidism symptoms,-0.1550899446010589,2,q,3,0.012345679012345678,351,11

They include drugs that target inflammation in the brain and spinal cord, such as riluzole or methotrexate; those that affect metabolism in the central nervous system (CNS), including carbamazepine, phenytoin and others; and those that treat glial cells that support the immune system, which includes cyclosporine, lamotrigine, cyclophosphamide, cycloserine and others.

What I have done for MS is to keep my body healthy by taking a variety of vitamins, minerals, herbs and other supplements. I also do some massage therapy at home. For example, if I feel pain on one side of the neck, I massage that area twice daily until I don't get any tenderness. The muscles relax then tighten up again over time. That helps reduce the swelling. But there are several different forms of massage that work best for me — manual, electrical and acupressure (a type of traction). You should talk to your physician about the kind that works best for you.

(this was done by the person who made the game, but he did it before you were even born)

A: This is one of the most common mistakes of students when learning to read. In English we do have two things that help us learn about a word's meaning. We know how it sounds as well as the context in which it has been used. A player can think back on what they have seen and heard of characters. They will generally remember many more details from one encounter than they will from another! The second thing we try to learn is the relationships between letters in words. We are taught that each letter represents a sound and therefore we also need to be able to identify the different sounds in the word. If someone starts typing an unfamiliar word with one of these letters it means that they cannot hear the difference between them. You should always use your left hand to type, but sometimes you may find yourself using both hands while playing games such as D&D or Magic the Gathering. This can lead to errors because the fingers tend to move closer together than normal and so it is harder for them to see the difference between letters.

The main cause of this error is that the student only knows a few letters. To correct it you must first become comfortable with a lot of new characters. Then, once you get familiar enough with those new characters, you can concentrate on learning the rest of the word. It took me several sessions to learn how to type correctly.

gpt2-xl_92,"the etiology and symptoms of fatigue in MS \r

MS is a disorder characterized by chronic pain, loss of strength and mobility, sleep disturbances, and an exacerbation of other health problems. Many MS patients experience fatigue with or without other symptoms that can be debilitating, disabling, and disabling to their quality of life. MS often goes undiagnosed for many years, which leads some patients to have significant disability as well as to suffer from symptoms that impair functioning at work and home. The current study aims to identify potential risk factors and treatments targeting these common fatigue/disability symptoms in MS. The results will help clinicians better understand this complex condition and provide them with information about specific treatment options.

The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate whether there were differences between individuals who report fatigue-free periods during MS course and those who do not in terms of their responses to three self-reported questions related to cognitive functioning (e.g., memory, attention, executive function). Additionally, it was expected that fatigue-free intervals would correlate positively with performance on cognitive tests assessing executive function performance, but that it would be non-significant in relation to measures measuring memory or attention. Lastly, we sought to determine if fatigue was associated with changes in physical activity levels among people reporting fatigue-free periods. In addition, fatigue-free interval status was assessed using a validated questionnaire and multiple measurements of fatigue. These variables are presented in Table 1.

Therefore, our primary measure of cognitive function was the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), a 16 item test of mental stability and cognition based upon the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory [30]. We asked participants to rate their cognitive abilities using the following items: ""In general, how well would you describe yourself?"" followed by ""How much trouble would you say you get every day?"":

Dietary fiber is an important component of a healthy diet. The American Diabetes Association recommends that individuals consume at least 10-15 grams of dietary fiber per day, which can be obtained in many different ways, including from fruits and vegetables. Fiber plays many roles in the body, such as helping to maintain bowel regularity, preventing constipation, providing energy to support strong bones, supporting proper blood sugar levels, and helping with weight management and maintaining a stable weight (1). In addition to serving as a source of fiber, fruits and vegetables are also rich sources of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, phytochemicals, and other nutrients. Fruits and vegetables contain numerous bioactive compounds, most notably lycopene, β-carotene, vitamin C, zinc, folate, lutein, zeaxanthin, anthocyanins, flavonoids, and polyphenols (2). A study published in 2009 found that eating a diet high in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables significantly reduced the risk of developing diabetes by 27% compared to people who ate a low-fiber diet (3). Whole grains are a complete food consisting of complex carbohydrates that are easily digested and absorbed (4) and include wheat bran, oat groats, barley flour, rye flour, cornmeal, oats, amaranth seed kernels, millet, sorghum, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, and sesame seeds. Fruit juices have no calories and provide many of the same beneficial effects as whole fruit. However, they may vary slightly from one variety to another because some varieties are naturally sweetened and others are not. Foods like apples, pears, oranges, bananas, grapes, blueberries, peaches, plums, and papaya are all excellent choices for reducing your risk of becoming diabetic if you limit yourself to two servings a week (5). There is limited evidence on whether or not consuming more than four servings a day of fruits and vegetables reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Researchers did find, however, that a higher intake of fruits and vegetables was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations in overweight women (6), but further research is needed before we can say that this provides any additional health benefits. For example, these findings do not prove that each serving of fruit or vegetable is better for reducing insulin resistance than any other portion size. It would take several years of well-designed studies to determine how much fruit and vegetables help reduce diabetes risk (7).

GMOs: Genetically Modified Organisms.

GM foods: food produced by genetically modifying plants with genes from other organisms.

Human exposure to pesticides: There have been many studies showing that pesticide use has negative health effects on humans. The most recent study suggests that human exposure to pesticides may be as high as 1 billion pounds per year. That would represent about 0.5% of the total amount used annually in the U.S., according to the EPA.

IMPACT OF Pesticides on Humans and Wildlife: Pesticide residues can accumulate in animals and people through ingestion of contaminated soil, water, air and food. Exposure to these compounds is highly toxic if it occurs over an extended period of time. When exposed chronically, pesticide residue levels increase dramatically. In addition, insecticidal and fungicidal agents cause damage to the central nervous system by interfering with the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. These chemicals also affect the immune system leading to diseases such as autism and Alzheimer's disease. Insecticidal and fungicidal sprays contain heavy metals including lead, cadmium, arsenic and mercury. Pesticide exposures also interfere with reproduction. Many herbicides and their metabolite metabolites can be endocrine disrupters and cause reproductive problems in mammals.

POTENTIAL DISEASE ASSOCIATED WITH GROWTH INPLACE OR DISTILLING VACCINES: Studies suggest that chronic exposure to certain pesticides may result in developmental disorders. For example, repeated prenatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) results in reduced brain size in children.

PURPOSE OF TESTING AND EVALUATION: Test methods used to detect pesticide contamination include gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS), liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and ion mobility spectroscopy (IMS).

TEST RESULTS: Toxicity of pesticide samples are evaluated using commonly accepted cutoffs at which concentrations above those thresholds indicate potential toxicity.

A: MS can be diagnosed at any age. It usually starts after age 25, although it may develop later than that. The earliest recorded case of MS occurred in 1834. Although the exact cause remains unknown, it appears to be linked to an immune system disorder called Epstein Barr virus (EBV). EBV is found in approximately one-third of all people with HIV infection.

How long does it take for multiple sclerosis to develop?

The first symptoms of MS generally appear between 20 and 30 years old. People who are young or very active tend to have more severe symptoms. In addition to being tired, they feel numbness and tingling throughout their body. They also often find themselves having difficulty walking. As time goes by, these sensations become progressively worse. By the time many people reach middle age, some of them have lost the ability to walk completely without assistance. Some patients lose the ability to speak altogether because they cannot recognize faces.

What causes multiple sclerosis?

There isn't one specific disease process that leads to MS. However, scientists believe that environmental factors play a role. For instance, exposure to certain chemicals and viruses, as well as genetic mutations that occur during early childhood, can lead to the development of autoimmune diseases such as MS. Scientists do not yet know why some people get sicker or die sooner from these illnesses.

How can I prevent multiple sclerosis?

Many common conditions can trigger MS. These include:

Radiation exposure – Radiation has been known to trigger MS before in some cases. Children born within two weeks of receiving large doses of radiation have developed MS at much higher rates than children born earlier in pregnancy.

What should I do?\nA: Concentrate on remembering one simple word or phrase at a time while taking regular breaks for breathing exercises (like counting backwards). This will help you remember what you are trying to learn. If this fails then try repeating it out loud (using your voice) several times and see if that helps.

Forgetfulness

Q: Am I forgetting things, and how often does it happen?\nA: In most cases it happens after a few minutes, but it can take up to half an hour for symptoms to appear.

Symptoms include: fatigue, headaches, confusion, slurred speech, trouble thinking clearly, nausea, dizziness, numbness, tingling, pain and itching. For some people there are physical effects as well such as muscle tension and joint pains.

Q: Is it normal for my doctor to prescribe medication to me before seeing another specialist?\nA: Yes. Many doctors who work in primary care clinics or hospitals use medications to treat conditions like MS. However, it's not unusual for other specialists to have similar prescriptions. Sometimes these prescriptions aren't medically necessary. Talk to your doctor about your treatment options and ask if he has any recommendations.

Q: Why isn't my doctor seeing me right away when I start showing signs of MS?\nA: A good first visit is made between a couple of weeks and six months after diagnosis. This is because many patients continue to experience symptoms long after they're diagnosed. However, sometimes symptoms don't occur until years later.

Q: I have had no improvement in my MS symptoms since starting medication. I feel helpless.

Since the drug combination has not been tested on its own merits, there is no way to know if or how these serious complications may be related directly to the vaccine.

Cancer Vaccines for People Taking Multiple Sclerosis Drugs

Vaccination against cancer is now recommended by most medical organizations and governments worldwide. However, vaccination against leukemia/lymphoma (LAM) remains only a recommendation. The CDC does not recommend any additional vaccines specifically targeted at LAM since there are no clinical trials looking into their safety and effectiveness. Because LAM is so rare and so difficult to diagnose, many patients will need to undergo more than one or two vaccines before being diagnosed with LAM, which can lead to immunodeficiency. Therefore, in order to maximize patient safety and minimize costs, it makes sense to start vaccinating people at an early age in order to reduce the risk of developing cancer later on.

Some vaccines that are recommended for adults, such as MMR, also protect against LAM. These vaccines contain live viral components, but they don't cause disease when given to children or adults. They are designed to stimulate immune responses in childhood and young adulthood, similar to the response needed to fight off a common cold.

For example, the Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine contains the bacterium pneumococcus, which causes pneumonia and sepsis, both of which are symptoms of LAM. In addition, the tetanus toxoid vaccine stimulates immunity against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis — three bacterial infections that are associated with LAM.

There are currently about 100 different types of LAM, including the following:

Primary Lymphocytic Leukemia – also known as acute myelogenous leukemia (AMS), this type usually appears between ages 5 and 40 years. It's extremely aggressive, often producing large tumors on bone marrow biopsy. About 1 out of every 3,000 cases is fatal. Most AMS occurs in children under 15 years of age.

However, because you did not file an accurate Parental Consent Form for SRA coverage when you applied, a parent cannot assert that he or she was unable to sign a statement to indicate that he or she consented to receiving benefits on behalf of his or her children. Instead, if an individual with a disability who received SRA coverage before February 1, 2000, but who does not qualify now for SRA health insurance benefits (i.e., all individuals are enrolled in Medicare), he or she may submit a valid Affidavit of Waiver or Authorization to Receive Benefits. If a person receives only limited-purpose Medicare coverage, he or she must fill out a Supplemental Affidavit of Eligibility, in addition to affirming that he or she meets the requirements for Medicare coverage. See 44 CFR Part 164.50 for more information about submitting such forms.

Results: During a median follow-up time of 8 years, 565 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer; 462 underwent treatment, and 683 received at least one radiotherapy treatment (Table 1). The five most common indications for therapy were radiation to distant sites, radical prostatectomy, and/or chemotherapy. Among all cases, there were no differences between those treated with surgery versus radiotherapy or radiation alone. Survival after diagnosis was similar among both groups (Table 2). Compared with those treated with radiation alone, survival with either surgery or radiotherapy appeared to be worse overall but not within subgroups defined by grade of disease, Gleason score, location, age, Gleason score and treatment group. There was no significant difference in survival according to risk factors of interest (e.g., PSA level, family history of prostate cancer, PSA concentration, serum total testosterone level), although the results differed depending on whether data from men in the entire study population or only those whose cases were matched to control groups were used. In addition, men undergoing early radical prostatectomies had an increased likelihood of dying than did those treated by conventional methods, whereas the latter's mortality rate actually decreased as their tumor size diminished.

Comment

In this large prospective cohort study, compared with those treated with radiotherapy alone or when combined with radiation, radiation plus chemotherapy proved to be equally effective in preventing recurrent prostate cancer. Although several possible explanations could account for such a result, including improvements in patient compliance and improvement in response to treatment, none are likely valid. We speculate that, in a setting where the probability of being diagnosed is low and prognosis is good, more aggressive treatment strategies may be justified. Indeed, our results suggest that aggressive management should be considered for men who do not respond well to radiotherapy alone or if they have poor response to conventional therapy. The observed benefit of radiation plus chemotherapy over radiation alone can probably be attributed to improved outcomes in cases with localized tumors or with high-risk subtypes associated with multiple risk factors (e.g., PSA levels).

How To Do The Squat Routine

The exercises described above are a good starting point for anyone trying to improve their squatting technique. Here's how I personally go about training the squat; it's based off an exercise I first learned from the great coach John Grimek. His program included squats as part of the warm-up for every workout. This was because many people were not accustomed to performing squats on non-conventional surfaces such as box springs or mats (yes, I know, it sounds weird). As a result, they didn't have any idea what to expect when doing squats on these surfaces.

However, over time, people began using these techniques correctly. In addition, it became increasingly common to see coaches incorporate squatting into their programs for their athletes. So while squats were still only used as an eccentric movement in most cases, they now made up almost half of the warm-ups we performed at the beginning of our workout.

In other words, if you want to make real gains in your squatting performance, I strongly recommend incorporating them into your warm-up routine. You'll notice that the barbell will typically be lower than you would normally be using when you perform the squat. That is because by doing the exercise properly, you are teaching your body how to handle heavier weight without having to increase its strength all together. It is much easier to teach a muscle to contract harder when the load is light rather than heavy.

Below are some of the basic movements that I prefer to use when doing squats during the rest days of a regular workout. You may decide that some of these exercises aren't appropriate for you due to various reasons. However, if there is someone out there who needs more help with these exercises, please let me know. My goal is to provide everyone with an excellent, effective training plan so that they can maximize their potential in the gym.

gpt2-xl_101,"inflammation of the liver caused by too much alcoholA: a symptom of fibromyalgia. It usually begins 2 to 4 weeks after you have your first drink, although it can occur at any time during pregnancy. Symptoms include headaches and neck pain. They may also be accompanied by fatigue, nausea or vomiting, and abdominal cramps. When they are severe, they cause rapid weight loss and the inability to stand up straight for more than a few seconds. These symptoms often disappear within one week or two, but sometimes last several months. The only way to treat fibromyalgia is with medication, which must take place regularly throughout life to prevent its recurrence. A number of medications exist that may alleviate some of these symptoms. The drug cyclobenzaprine (Cytoxan) should always be used before alcohol because it blocks the action of acetaldehyde in your liver. Other drugs that may relieve the symptoms of fibromyalgia include the benzodiazepines diazepam (Valium), temazepam (Ativan), lorazepam (Ativan) and oxazepam (Soma).

Eating habits: alcohol, caffeine, tobacco, dieting


Coffee, tea and diet pills: Your doctor may recommend adding these things into your daily routine as part of treatment. These include caffeine, herbal teas such as St John's Wort, green coffee beans, cocoa powder, soy milk and chocolate. These will help to keep your blood sugar stable so that your body does not become dehydrated. You may feel less tired if you stop drinking coffee and tea and limit your intake of food containing caffeine. Avoid eating foods that contain carbohydrates like white bread, crackers and pastries. If you do eat them, make sure to add extra fiber and water. Drinking diet pills may help improve how well you sleep at night by increasing metabolism. However, diet pills are unlikely to change how many pounds you lose. Diet pills can also delay the onset of weight-loss surgery. Although this type of procedure involves removing excess fat from your abdomen, diet pills do not remove the calories you burn through exercise or physical activity. As mentioned above, cutting out these kinds of foods can make your fibromyalgia symptoms worse. Exercise is another important part of your treatment plan. Although there is no cure for fibromyalgia, certain exercises can be helpful to ease your symptoms. Walking on a treadmill increases the amount of oxygen in your blood. This helps to reduce muscle tension and lower stress levels. Exercises that",101,heavy flares swelling lymph nodes,-12.349781036376951,93,q,3,0.7560975609756098,397,0

Q: how do you prepare your food? A: I just add a bit of water, salt, and sugar to it in the morning. Once I start working out, I eat more often (maybe once every two hours). The reason why is because the protein content of my meals are usually higher than the usual eating habits of people who are not physically active. So that they can gain weight without feeling tired afterwards or even hungry during their workouts.

What kind of training schedule would you recommend for someone interested in bodybuilding? A: I like to keep everything short, intense, and focused. When I am at home, I am always sleeping about 6-8hrs per day with 5-6hrs breaks in between. However, if I'm on stage I need longer breaks: from 2-3hr per day before going onstage to 4-5hrs per night afterwards.

How much exercise do you do per week? A: This depends entirely on me. During the offseason when I work out less, I train 3 times per week and during competitions only 1 time per month. But during the season, I try to get up at least 7-10hrs per day!

Do you use any supplements in your diet? A: I don't use any supplements other than water, salt, sugar and protein powder.

How many days off per week do you have? A: Usually during summer season I go down to 1 week off but sometimes I stay at 2 weeks. In winter season there's usually no downtime at all.

Can you give us a personal example of an important achievement that you achieved this year? What was the motivation behind it? A: Being able to become one of the first ever female winner at Mr Olympia 2017. That's definitely one of the biggest achievements of my life so far.

What are your goals for 2016? A: To continue growing as a Bodybuilder, compete against the best athletes around the world in various categories including Powerlifting, Weightlifting and Olympic Lifting. Continue getting stronger, faster and more muscular so that I will be capable of winning World Championships in different sports such as powerlifting and weightlifting.

If you could pick one thing from your past to change what it is, what would it be?

Q: What does an introvert do when he/she goes into therapy?\nA: An introverted person usually takes part in group sessions because they need support from other people while he/she changes his/her thinking and behavior. Introverts work better alone because they don't have the social skills required for this kind of therapy.


Q: How does the mind work?\nA: The mind works like any other machine - it has its own parts that keep it going and its self-adjusting function. It's like your computer, its core functions keep it running. This means that we humans often tend to use certain parts of our minds to adjust things around us, but not all the time. We also use parts of the brain for various types of thought, feeling and behaviour; the idea being that we only use the parts of our brains that allow us to think, feel and act clearly. When someone starts using the whole system they are called an extrovert. However, we still need some parts of the brain to perform basic tasks like controlling breathing or swallowing, which introverts don't need since the rest of the body controls these activities.


Q: What are the major problems associated with introversion?\nA: Most of the people who go into therapy (or similar programs) to deal with mental problems suffer from two main problems. First, they see themselves as having no control over their lives (which is why they seek help). Second, they have a hard time trusting others. Introverts don't need to trust people too much as they can handle their own affairs very well without them knowing about them, so the problem doesn't arise until people try to help.


Q: How can I tell if my friend is an introvert?\nA: A good way would be to ask him / her whether he/she likes to talk on the phone a lot or prefer talking to his/her friends over socializing at home. If they say ""yes"" to both of those questions, then they are probably highly sensitive.

gpt2-xl_119,"best pillow neck pain (question 4) Q. What are the most common symptoms of sleep apnea? A. Sleep apnea is a medical condition in which breathing repeatedly stops or slows down while you're sleeping, causing your throat to close up during waking hours. These pauses in breathing can last from seconds to minutes and could affect a person's ability to wake up and breathe normally at night. Common symptoms include difficulty breathing during sleep; difficulty breathing when awakening; snoring; rapid or irregular heartbeats; gasping for air; yawning; and chest pressure that increases with deep breaths. Most people have no more than two episodes of sleep apnea per year.


Sleep apnea can lead to serious problems, including: Heart attacks Heart attacks occur after repeated episodes of apneas. When someone has stopped breathing repeatedly for some time and their heart rate drops, they may experience a heart attack. The chance of having a heart attack as a result of a sleep apnea episode is 1 in 30,000. The risk of death due to heart disease (cardiovascular diseases) is around 1 in 3,500. In people with underlying heart conditions, the risk rises to 1 in 20. People who develop sleep apnea often stop exercising because it makes them tired, but exercise can be very beneficial for sleep apnea sufferers. For example, regular, slow walking can help reduce apnea-related daytime sleepiness, so people who have trouble getting a good night's rest should regularly walk or bike to bed. But regular exercise can also make it harder to fall asleep later at night and increase how long it takes before you feel sleepy again. Walking helps to relax you, making you less likely to have an episode of sleep apnea. It also reduces daytime drowsiness because you're moving around. It's not possible to know what effect exercise will have on sleep apnea until we try it out for ourselves. If you're concerned about exercise or want to start doing more of it soon, talk to your doctor. This may prevent the need for further testing or treatment.

The patient reports that at the time of first symptom, his/her symptoms were worse than usual. The patient also complains that he has not slept well in the past few days and feels tired all the time. He has a history of hay fever and is using an antihistamine but he continues to have severe, persistent bronchitis and cough with phlegm production.

His chest x-ray shows:


In this case report we will discuss how the chest x-rays can be used as a screening tool for bronchiectasis, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid collection for fluid analysis, and pulmonary function tests (PFT).

Chest X-Ray:

If the lung function test results are negative or if there is no evidence of any air trapping by the lungs (i.e., no airflow obstruction), then bronchoscopy may be performed. Bronchoscope examination should follow bronchoscopic bronchoscopy if the clinical suspicion of bronchiectasis exists and the patient's symptoms continue to worsen despite use of an antihistamine or other treatment. If the diagnosis of bronchiectasis cannot be determined after bronchoscopy, a computed tomography scan (CT) with contrast medium may be considered. Contrast CT studies reveal the presence of small air spaces between the alveoli, bicarbonate levels in the blood, pulmonary capillary refill time, and changes in systolic and diastolic BP. These findings are helpful for the clinician to determine whether the patient needs further testing. However, these results do not necessarily correlate with clinically significant air trapping or lung disease.

How Can Chest X-Rays Be Used?

Most commonly, chest x-rays are used to screen patients suspected of having bronchial asthma. When evaluating the role of chest x-rays in the evaluation of a patient with severe, recurrent cough accompanied by acute exacerbations of symptoms, it is important to remember the following:

These images are often only useful when the underlying medical problem warrants their use. In some cases, bronchopneumonia, which causes chronic inflammation of the lungs, will be diagnosed on physical exam alone. Therefore, if you suspect your patient has chronic bronchitis, bronchoscopy is usually recommended.

My son has had it for about 5 years now. He was diagnosed with POTS in January 2004. I took him off the meds completely, however he kept getting sicker and worse as time went on. Finally in September 2007 he was hospitalized again because his fever got so bad that the doctors thought he might die. When they finally did discharge him back home he said it was one of the worst experiences of his life. The following month I started trying to get him back on the meds again. I found that if you don't take the meds for too long at first and try not to go back to them unless your doctor gives you permission then you can usually control the flare ups without any problems. Also, if you have an allergic reaction to Benadryl you can make a homemade remedy by mixing 1/4 cup powdered milk with 2 cups water and giving it to yourself once or twice daily until your symptoms subside.A: Yes. You should see your primary care physician very frequently for blood work and other tests. It's also good to talk with your family physician, especially if they suspect you might have a disease like POTS and heart failure.

Q: What is an MS-related symptom that can last years? Can anyone else tell me what those things are?\nA: There are many kinds of MS symptoms. The most common ones are muscle weakness, difficulty speaking, trouble understanding speech, loss of bladder control, and problems walking or balancing on one foot. They affect about 20 percent of patients. Other common problems include vision changes, headaches, dizziness, numbness in hands and feet, fatigue, depression, anxiety, concentration difficulties, memory problems, tingling sensation when moving parts of body, and tingling in joints like the knees and elbows. These often start while patients are still young children and continue into adulthood. It's important to remember that not all of these problems will show up right away. The brain isn't made fully until age 30 or so, after which it becomes less able to repair itself as it ages. Also, the symptoms that occur earlier in life are usually easier to treat than later ones because the damage occurs at an early stage of disease development and treatment options aren't limited as much.

A number of researchers have reported that female patients have higher levels of depressive symptoms when treated with antidepressants. In one study, depressed patients were found to have greater severity of depressive symptoms on both the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and Beck Depression Inventory than non-depressed females (Nguyen et al., 2005). Similarly, in another study, female patients with MS showed increased prevalence of major depression symptomatology compared to their male counterparts (Lopez et al., 2007)."" http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/286/2/E101 ""The role of oestrogen in central nervous system (CNS)-mediated pathogenesis in AD was first hypothesized by Wacholder & Schuhmacher (1943), based upon data from the German perinatal cohort of 1932–1945. These investigators observed elevated levels of serum oestradiol at 10 weeks postpartum in mothers with breast cancer after they became pregnant. Subsequently, it was shown that high plasma levels of oestrogen induce CNS-induced apoptosis and dysfunction of neuronal excitability.

We must consider that our modern lifestyle has caused many people to become sick as a consequence of their poor diet and lack of exercise. Most people are still unaware of how much stress they put on themselves by using electronic devices or watching television programs all day long, as well as by not getting enough rest during their sleep.

Do you think the environment and food quality will continue to deteriorate over the next few decades? \nA: It's unlikely that human beings will survive the coming generations without significant changes being made in the way we live. One of the key aspects of this transformation will be the rapid improvement of medical care and prevention of environmental problems. This will depend upon the development of new drugs, vaccines, devices, techniques, etc., which will also require fundamental research in medicine. These developments should lead to major advances in longevity, the ability to reverse aging and greatly reduce the likelihood of suffering from various types of illnesses. The same technologies could save billions of lives through preventative measures which would allow us to extend life expectancy considerably beyond today's levels. In addition, advances in artificial intelligence will make possible the creation of living computers with unprecedented capabilities. Eventually, our descendants may develop super intelligent robots to assist them throughout their whole lifetime. However, the first generation robots may provide assistance only if our species decides to cooperate. For example, to overcome conflicts between humans and other animals or between nations we might create robot companions who don't kill when necessary, but instead act as ambassadors for peace and cooperation between peoples, countries or races, thus promoting peace among humanity as a whole. \",1,What are the most common chronic diseases?

Q: Do you remember when you started lifting? Did you ever think about the money?A: No. My first job out of high school was working at the Walmart in my hometown as an assembly line worker. That was kind of cool and I loved doing that. Then one day I got laid off from that job and the only thing I could get that paid well enough was sales for a company called AIG. I went there because I wanted to work with people who were really passionate about helping people make their dreams come true.

If your company is one of the first companies in your industry or field to publicly announce that it has MS, you might be surprised by how many people assume that everyone with MS works for a pharmaceutical company. The reality, however, is that MS is a lifelong condition and most people don't have a diagnosis until later in life. Therefore, there are many people who believe that MS is an occupational disease.

The stigma associated with MS can make working conditions even more difficult than usual. This is where MSers' skills come into play. As a result, many MSers want to do what they can to help others who also deal with chronic illness.

Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease that affects millions of people worldwide. It results from the body's immune system attacking healthy cells and tissues. The severity of psoriasis varies widely, but it often involves painful red patches on the face, scalp or limbs.


It can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic predisposition, environmental agents such as pollution and smoking, medical conditions, viruses and bacterial infections. Although psoriasis may appear to be a simple condition when first spotted, over time it can lead to more severe symptoms, including long-term pain, scarring and disfigurement in some cases.",132,headpats scalp psoriasis,-0.0095927473157644,0,q,4,0.0,202,33
gpt2-xl_94,"The best time for you to begin feeling better is when your doctor says that it's safe for you to move about. For most people, this means the second or third week of your first treatment. However, after a while, things can get more difficult, and you may need to be on an extended course of medicine. This is because multiple sclerosis changes over time -- some people develop fewer symptoms in their 20s than in their 40s. That's why doctors are cautious about prescribing long-term medicines for people who have MS at any age. At the same time, even though multiple sclerosis progresses rapidly during adolescence, you should not wait until later. It would be irresponsible not to try to protect yourself from MS by taking steps now. If you do decide to stop your MS medication, you'll have to take it every day for several months before it starts working again. (The dose you receive will depend on how many treatments you've had.)

Q: What else does Multiple Sclerosis cost me as a teen or adult?\nA: Most insurance companies don't cover MS therapy. Some states require insurers to provide coverage; others aren't sure whether they must. Insurance premiums range from $200 to $1,000 per month for the annual out-of-pocket costs. Your family could pay much more if you're covered by Medicaid, Medicare or other health plans. There are several ways to help reduce these costs: 1) Make a list of friends who have MS and ask them to contribute money or donate books to Goodwill, thrift stores or community centers. 2) Join a group support program such as Parents of MS or MS Awareness and Support Group. 3) Take advantage of free educational programs or clinics offered by local churches and schools. 4) Check with local MS organizations to see what discounts or scholarships may be available. 5) Talk to your college about getting financial aid for tuition and related expenses associated with MS. 6) If you live outside the U.S., check into international scholarships or grants through www.msfoundation.org/scholarships. 7) Look into charities that give awards in exchange for donations such as the American Autoimmune Related Disease Association. 8) Donate used clothing at goodwill, charity shops and recycling centers. 9) Contact the National Multiple Sclerosis Society for assistance with donating used eyeglasses. 10) Consider enrolling in the Student Financial Assistance Program at your university or college. 11) Visit the National Multiple Sclerosis Society website for information on other free resources.",94,When will I start to feel better with multiple sclerosis?,-0.0294843520969152,0,q,4,0.0,412,25

There's an option for emergency contraception that can be used immediately after unprotected sex; however, this is not recommended at this time as it does not work as well when taken within 2 days after unprotected sex.

Q: how do I know if my doctor has been through pelvic exams?

A: doctors should discuss your symptoms with their OBGYN prior to examining you. If you notice any abnormal discharge from or a change in the size or shape of a lump on your lower belly/waist, you should see your gynecologist. This could mean that something is wrong with your uterus (endometrium), ovaries, cervix, or fallopian tubes. It may also indicate an ectopic pregnancy, which is a condition where an embryo implants outside the uterus but grows into a baby without needing to continue developing normally inside of it (called a fertilized egg). For more information about ectopic pregnancies, please visit our Endometrial Health page.

Q: what else would cause me to have pain during intercourse?

A: Pain during sex occurs in up to 6% of women who are using hormonal birth control pills and is usually caused by either bleeding or spotting while you're having intercourse. You may feel cramping, burning, or pressure throughout your pelvis, and your partner may experience pain.

If you suspect that your partner might have had vaginal irritation due to using hormonal contraceptives, check out this article for tips to minimize discomfort while sex: Does Oral Contraception Cause Vaginal Irritation?, and speak with your doctor about whether you'd like to switch to an alternative method of birth control.

Treatment for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease

The first step to treating pelvic inflammatory disease is understanding its causes. Unfortunately, even though research shows that some forms of infertility can be directly linked to endometriosis, many patients don't understand how endometriosis affects fertility. In addition, some people are afraid of the idea of undergoing surgery to remove the uterus and then seeing the scarring and damage done in the future. That's why we offer several options for treatment of pelvic inflammation, including:

gpt2-xl_63,"Multiple sclerosis can impair a person's ability to work, but it does not permanently prevent an individual from working. The effects of MS vary depending on the individual and the disease (MS), which may cause muscle atrophy or paralysis in one side of the body while allowing other areas of the body to function normally. Some individuals with MS may experience fatigue, depression, cognitive difficulties, memory loss, difficulty speaking, problems walking, or other symptoms that significantly limit their ability to perform typical daily activities. However, many people with MS are able to maintain the same level of activity they have always enjoyed without any noticeable limitations. Individuals with MS typically require help with basic physical tasks such as dressing, bathing, eating, maintaining relationships, driving, and managing finances. They may also need assistance with shopping for groceries, preparing meals, using computers, taking medications, and more.

How do I know if I'm having MS?\nA: If you suspect you might have MS, talk to your doctor about testing. It is important to be tested before you begin therapy, at least once during treatment. For most people, the disease clears up on its own over time. There are several types of tests used to diagnose MS, including: Blood test (polymerase chain reaction) - this blood test looks at proteins called proteins known as antigens. These proteins are thought by some scientists to be the first signs of MS. Polymerase chain reaction tests measure how much protein is present in the patient's blood. This test tells doctors whether a person has been diagnosed with MS or another condition, like diabetes, that affects how well the body processes food. Autopsy - an autopsy is a procedure where tissue samples are removed from the body and examined under a microscope to determine the exact nature of a problem. An autopsy will often show what type of MS the body has. A spinal tap - sometimes called an endovascular catheterization procedure, this technique uses a small tube through which fluid collects and enters the bloodstream. When fluid is introduced into the spinal cord, it causes electrical signals to travel along nerve fibers, causing them to communicate with each other and the brain. The flow of electrical impulses determines the course of action of specific nerves. During an endovascular catheterization procedure, the surgeon removes a small amount of fluid inside the spinal canal so that it can collect in the arteries between the vertebrae. In this way, they are able to determine whether or not the presence of fluid in certain locations indicates that there could be a neurological problem",63,Will multiple sclerosis affect my career?,-0.120895430445671,7,q,4,0.028,431,3
gpt2-xl_59,"no significant difference in the incidence or prevalence of MS between patients who received placebo and those who took melatonin, but there was a trend towards a reduced risk of developing MS among people who take melatonin for more than six months.

BELOW: Table 7 summarizes all published studies on the use of melatonin to treat multiple sclerosis.

C. Inhibitor of platelet aggregation: A study conducted at Mount Sinai Medical Center found that an oral supplement containing 50 mg of melatonin per day did not affect the level of CAA in blood (Fig. 8). This finding is consistent with other research showing that melatonin does not bind to CCAAs, which are thought to be responsible for inhibiting platelets' ability to aggregate when they come into contact with clots of blood during bleeding.2 These results suggest that melatonin does not contribute to CAA levels in blood.

D. Melatonin's inhibition of platelet aggregation may contribute to its antiinflammatory properties: There have been several clinical trials examining the effect of melatonin on various inflammatory conditions including heart attack, stroke, arthritis, inflammation of the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, and allergic reactions.3 Although these studies have yielded some promising results, each has had methodological limitations. For example, most studies have used very low doses of melatonin and/or have examined only one inflammatory condition. Another limitation involves the high rate of discontinuation due to side effects associated with melatonin supplementation.4 Therefore, it remains unknown if taking melatonin supplements will lead to beneficial effects in any particular individual patient population.

E. Other adverse effects not related to melatonin: The FDA has issued warnings about several other potential adverse effects from the use of melatonin. One such effect occurs in women when taken during pregnancy.5 A small number of reports of miscarriage have also been reported during treatment with melatonin.6

F. What about sleep disorders? It has been suggested that melatonin may disrupt sleep patterns in certain individuals.7–9 However, other researchers have questioned this claim because melatonin may enhance daytime alertness in otherwise healthy adults.10–12 This suggests that melatonin may promote wakefulness rather than block it. If so, then the proposed link between melatonin and insomnia could simply reflect the fact that melatonin inhibits neuronal activity when we lie down, whereas we fall asleep when we stand up. Furthermore, evidence suggests that melatonin has many health benefits beyond improving sleep quality.13–15",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-3.013989925384521,21,q,4,0.10294117647058823,393,5

Many people also have numbness or tingling in the arms, legs, hands and feet as well as weakness, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. (2) \nC: How common is MS?\nA: There was one reported case of MS during each year of childhood until 2007. In 2008 there were two reported cases. It has been estimated that there are approximately 300 million people worldwide with MS. (3) \nD: Do doctors diagnose MS by looking for lesions?\nA: Doctors do not usually look for lesions but can spot other health problems associated with MS such as sensory problems, hearing loss, muscle rigidity, joint pain, depression, sleep problems, anxiety, suicidal ideation, social isolation, mood swings, and difficulty concentrating. (4) \nE: Does MS affect children differently than adults?\nA: No. Children who develop MS at any age will show all the signs and symptoms listed above. However, when diagnosed before school age, children tend to make fewer changes and may be more likely to attend school normally. (5) \nF: Who develops MS first? What triggers the onset of MS?\nA: Although no single cause has been identified, most studies indicate that early life factors such as genetic predisposition and environmental toxins play major roles in determining risk for developing MS later in life. (6) \nG: Can I avoid MS symptoms if I'm living a healthy lifestyle?\nA: It depends on your individual response to treatment. If you're taking medication then this is unlikely to be effective because it alters brain chemistry. Even if you take an anti-inflammatory drug, your levels of inflammation and autoantibodies will continue to rise until your treatment is completed. If you have healthy blood pressure, cholesterol, thyroid function and blood sugar, you should not need treatment for MS unless you start to experience clinical symptoms such as numbness or tingling in your extremities or facial features.

This will require them to check whether the condition you're experiencing fits into one of the categories listed above; and if so, what the cause is. If you still think the condition doesn't fit then you may need to work through a series of questions to find out exactly why you feel distressed. You should be aware that at any stage in this process, your GP or psychologist could refer you to other medical professionals, such as a psychiatrist, occupational therapist, counsellor or psychologist, depending on the nature of your symptoms, their severity and how they impact on your day-to-day activities.

gpt2-xl_85,"What is this?

A: It's a condition where there are repeated relapses of the disease, often within just days. The person might have had an early relapse that was so severe it caused them to lose all function in their legs and arms or even kill them from damage or infection. Or they might be able to get through one relapse but then find themselves unable to walk for weeks or months after. Often they can't move at all without help. Then, with another relapse, they may fall down. And the cycle continues until either the person dies or gets better again.


The more serious type of relapsing remitting MS (RMS) has symptoms such as weakness on one side of your body, numbness on your feet, loss of muscle tone on one side of your face or hands, and problems with speech, balance and vision. People usually develop some degree of disability after relapsing for a short time, sometimes only days or weeks. But as the disease progresses, you'll experience worse symptoms until eventually your whole body is affected and you can no longer see anything clearly. A few years ago, people who were treated with steroids called glucocorticoids were found to get better rapidly when they first began treatment because they could control the inflammation associated with the disease by taking drugs. However, after about six months or so, when they stopped using these drugs, many of those patients got worse again. They were left vulnerable to other types of infections, which could cause further relapses.


Because so much research has been done on drug therapies, we know what causes relapsing remitting MS. We also understand how the disease affects different parts of the brain and spinal cord. This knowledge helps us understand how to treat RMS. There are several things that are known about this disease, including:


* When an immune system attack occurs, cells inside your nervous system become damaged. These changes can lead to nerve cell death, which leads to paralysis or a loss of mobility. In recent years, researchers have begun studying ways to stop the immune response before the damage to the nerves takes place, and thus prevent a cascade of events that ultimately kills nerve cells. Drugs are currently used to suppress the immune system. Some of these medications work well and others do not. Scientists are working hard to improve the effectiveness of treatments and discover new ones. If we succeed, we will likely have treatments that give people back their independence and ability to move around completely independent of any external support.

A: Make sure you have enough sleep at night, and try to take the medication as close to bedtime as possible. Try to get 8 hours of sleep per night on average, which is about 14 hours. B: Take your medication when you are hungry, or if it seems like a good time for you to do so.

Solution 2 (Windows 7): This solution works on Windows 10 and Windows 8/8.1, but you need to be aware that this may not work with older versions of Windows like Vista, XP or 2000. The reason for this is the way how the game handles a crash dump file. When trying to run the game, it will first try to create one by using the DLLs in %SystemRoot%\.dmp. However, if the program crashes at any point during creating a crash dump, it'll then start looking for the main executable (.exe) file from which the problem occurred. So, for example, if your application crashes at some point, it might still use the DLLs located inside of C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\, even though the actual crash dump was made by another process. So, as long as both processes are running at the same time, the game will start searching for an application-specific location and generate a crash dump. You can test for this behavior by opening a Command Prompt window and entering the following command: wmic product where 'Product' starts with ""Microsoft® DirectX"". For example, to see what happens when crashing with Microsoft Visual Studio 2012, type Wmic Product Where 'VSTS2012' starts with ""Visual Studio 2012"". If you have a 64-bit version of Windows, you will also get errors about having more than two compatible 32-bit applications installed.

(I don't know if it's just me or not but since this has been asked by so many people here, I thought I'd add my answer)

This might be related to your other symptoms, as many things that are not related to MS can affect your sleep such as headaches, neck pain, back pain, joint stiffness, etc... For example, some people who take an over-the-counter headache medicine report feeling worse during the day on days when they were taking their medication, and then feel better after the drug wears off...this would also apply to anxiety and depression. If these feelings persist, it may be worth having a neurologist look at them for possible underlying problems.

For example, I had a symptom called ""exhaustion"" that started happening around Christmas time (early January), I was already getting a little tired from being in school most of the year, and when I looked into it further, I found out that I had a very rare genetic condition called Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). The gene responsible for DMD is present in only one person in every billion (1 in 50,000 people), hence the name Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.. The main symptom of DMD is muscle weakness (a limp), which is why this disease makes people feel pretty much completely worthless. Also, although there are other muscular disorders like lupus, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy usually shows up first in its milder form, typically between the ages of 16-18 years old, and it tends to improve before showing up in any severe form at all later on (usually after age 40-50 years old). As far as this illness goes, we really don't understand what causes it - whether it is due to something in the body itself, or because of a problem in the brain causing the muscles to weaken, or both...at least at the moment we aren't able to find anything specifically that will make people with DMD stronger, or live longer. We've done studies trying to see if certain drugs can help control symptoms of DMD, but we haven't managed to show any improvement yet in terms of DMD symptoms.

SIDE EFFECTS OF SPINAL CORDIOLIN EXTRACURRILISATION*

Elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels have been reported in patients with spinal cord injury, including atrioventricular septal defects and cervical dissection. Elevation of CSF proteins has been associated with peripheral nerve compression (e.g., primary axonal neuropathy), decreased myelination and impaired axon regeneration (secondary stroke). In addition, elevated CSF glutamate may contribute to the pathophysiology of secondary stroke. As such, it is important that the physician consider all possible neurologic complications when performing spinal cord surgery.

Risks related to spinal cord surgery include infection, bleeding, thrombosis, muscle atrophy, respiratory depression, and central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. Spinal cord surgery can also be associated with increased morbidity and mortality compared to other surgical procedures; however, most cases of spinal cord injury are non-traumatic. However, if there is a suspicion of injury or disease (i.e. suspected or confirmed MS, ALS, etc.), patients should undergo detailed evaluation before initiating spinal cord surgery.

The symptoms of these diseases include daytime hyperarousal, daytime insomnia, frequent snoring and other sleep-related complaints.

Q: What causes MS or any autoimmune disease?

It has been proposed that MS may be caused by an immune response against nerve cells in the central nervous system (CNS). This hypothesis arose from studies showing a correlation between lesions on immunological assays for T cells and MS lesions at autopsy. However, there have also been recent reports suggesting that other factors contribute to the development of MS, including autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus (lymphocytic myelitis), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). These studies suggest that the pathogenesis of MS may involve more than one mechanism; however, it seems likely that both direct and indirect effects of cytokines play a role. Evidence suggests that the mechanisms involved may differ among different types of autoimmune diseases, but they are almost certainly not identical. For example, some studies show that IL10-producing T lymphocytes are responsible for causing SLE, while others do not. In addition, both lupus erythematosus and RA produce high levels of interferons (IFNs), which can stimulate production of proinflammatory cytokines. Several reports indicate that IFN-γ may contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of MS, although their contribution to disease severity remains unclear. Finally, evidence indicates that many autoimmune diseases are characterized by changes in the metabolism of certain hormones, and MS is no exception. Thus, these conditions appear to act through similar pathways in promoting the inflammatory cascade leading to MS.

The majority of studies assessing the relationship between autoimmunity and MS focus on the pathophysiology of specific autoantibodies; however, there appears to be little consensus about whether and how these autoantibodies interact with MS pathology. A recent review concluded that in light of emerging data, autoantibody studies were insufficient to make definite conclusions about the etiology of MS.

Can this happen if I get vaccinated against influenza?A: If you are taking certain types of anti-seizure medications, such as carbamazepine (Tegretol) or phenytoin (Dilantin), then yes, it is possible that you could develop seizures after vaccination. Other medications may also interfere with the immune system response to vaccines. It is important to discuss your medical condition with your physician before making any changes in your treatment plan. The flu shots do not contain any ingredients that have the potential to interact with your treatment regimen. They include latex, gelatin, egg protein, milk proteins, chicken eggs, sodium chloride, citric acid, dextrose, and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (not found in the human vaccine).

Q: Should I be worried about the presence of aluminum and other heavy metals in the Flu Shot?

A: Aluminum and many other contaminants from the vaccine have already left the body within several weeks following vaccination, so there should be no concern about ingesting them while receiving the vaccine. Some of these contaminants, such as mercury and formaldehyde, can cause adverse effects when they accumulate in the body over time. However, there are very low levels of contaminant exposure that would increase the risk of serious harm in adults who receive the flu shot. There was one case reported in 2001 of a child whose mother developed meningitis after receiving the flu shot; however, this was linked to her use of alcohol to help quell fever during the day and her breastfeeding. In addition, the most common side effect associated with the flu shot is soreness at injection sites caused by a thin needle. This occurs because the blood vessels in the area contract too quickly and dilate too rapidly. Most patients experience mild swelling and redness lasting up to 7 days following vaccination. After this period, skin will return to its normal coloration. For children, the maximum amount of time for symptoms to appear is 3 weeks.

There are currently no effective therapies for MS, but people who survive their initial attack may eventually live longer and be less likely to develop other diseases. The risk of developing multiple sclerosis can vary greatly from person to person. For example, one study suggests that about 10 percent of people diagnosed with the disease during a first attack will experience another; however, there has been little research on this topic (1).


The following is a brief summary of some possible risks for MS:

• A recent study at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio examined the lifetime risks of developing MS as well as those of death due to other causes for 1,566 people living in a general population. In general, the researchers found that MS was more common among men than women, younger persons compared with older ones, white individuals compared with non-white individuals, and African-American individuals compared with Caucasians or Asian Americans (2). The overall rates of dying from all causes were similar between male and female patients, regardless of race. However, MS patients had lower mortality rates from heart disease and stroke than did controls and were not more likely to die of cancers or other causes (3). This study also showed that while the incidence of MS increased in women throughout life, it decreased more sharply after age 40 than did that of the other causes of death studied.


For more information about the relationship between MS and cardiovascular disease, see the article ""Cerebrovascular Disease and Multiple Sclerosis"" (4).

• The American Academy of Neurology recommends avoidance of tobacco products including cigarettes and smokeless tobacco because they increase the risk of developing lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (5). Additionally, smoking increases the risk of several serious health problems related to tobacco use, including an increased risk of diabetes mellitus, certain types of leukemia and lymphoma, and depression (6).


Smoking appears to affect MS differently depending on whether people have already experienced MS or have never had MS (7). It also affects how often and when people relapse after stopping smoking (8).


People with MS are generally considered to be at high risk for developing COPD. Smoking may exacerbate symptoms of COPD such as wheezing, coughing up phlegm, chest tightness, and shortness of breath (9,10), which could lead someone with MS to engage in even heavier smoking habits (11,12).",58,Risk to develop multiple sclerosis,-0.0535010546445846,0,q,4,0.0,411,18

The current model assumes that all these processes are equally important in predicting the ability to perform exercise in different subgroups of individuals. However, it has been shown in both young and older adults that some people have more effective suppression mechanisms than others [5]. Furthermore, there appears to be an individual difference in how well these components are recruited/activated, with some individuals having greater sensitivity to PRV compared to other people [11,12], while some individuals may have better suppression mechanisms because they respond differently to PVC when exercising [7,14]. In addition to differences in the recruitment/activation of these two components, there also appear to be distinct pathways underlying their regulation. Specifically, one group of studies suggest that the activation of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity is critical for suppressing lung function during physical exertion, whereas another group suggests that pulmonary vasodilatation, mediated by vagal afferents from musculature, is essential for this role [15,16]. A new approach using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging combined with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may help clarify the role played by these two components. By analyzing the activation patterns of human bronchial airways as they enter, progress through, and exit various regions of the respiratory tract, we find evidence for increased ventral SNS (VS) signal, particularly around the base of the larynx, during the inhalation phase of breathing and decreased VS signals during exhalation [17-20]. While most of our previous work focused on the interaction between the VS and bronchi, there was no prior research on changes in the relationship between the VS and the trachea over time. Previous investigations of this topic were limited by not exploring whether these effects occur during periods of active breathing and by including only nonstressed subjects. In this study, we included subjects who had previously participated in a physical activity intervention program (i.e., yoga), and examined whether changes in VL/VT ratio were observed after participants performed prolonged exercise sessions. We hypothesized that this change would",113,asthma and covid,-12.535231590270996,206,q,4,0.9406392694063926,400,7

You need to tell your doctor about it, even though you think your headache is only due to stress or sleepless nights.It's true that when stress hormones (like cortisol) build up in the body, they cause inflammation. However, inflammation isn't what causes migraines. It's actually the buildup of proteins (called cytokines), such as interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, that trigger the symptoms.The immune system then produces chemicals called prostaglandins that block signals sent by the brain's electrical nerve cells, which tells the rest of the body what muscles to contract and where to move. If the prostaglandins aren't blocked, the nerves send messages that lead to headaches.There are two forms of migraine, primary (first symptom) and secondary (later symptoms).

Q: What are some types of psychotherapists you can call on?\nA: There are many different kinds of psychotherapists who work with all kinds of individuals including children, adolescents, adults, families, couples and groups. Some of these psychotherapists have specific training and knowledge that enables them to provide individualized treatment but others use just general skills to treat many clients. Most of these therapists use techniques that include talking therapies (talk therapy), self-help approaches (cognitive behavioral methods) and medication management strategies (antidepressants).\r

Q: Is it true that when someone chooses to stop seeing a therapist he will never go back and start seeing another one again?\nA: No. The process of choosing not to see a therapist is an important part of psychotherapy. Not wanting to continue seeing a particular therapist does not mean that there is no more value for you in working with that particular counselor at that time or that we cannot help you. Our staff members want to ensure that you get the most out of your experience because they know that your happiness depends upon our success. As we move from session to session you will learn more about how you feel. However, it is very common during this transition period that we notice changes in you and in our relationship with you. We do everything we can to keep you involved throughout this process. That being said, once you make the decision not to see us for whatever reason (whether it be lack of interest, dissatisfaction with our results, a family emergency, financial constraints, any other factors) then our door remains open to you for reattempts.\r

Q: How often should I meet with my therapist?\nA: Once every three months is considered typical and we encourage you to maintain this schedule each month until you find your best fit within the therapeutic relationship. While we don't recommend meeting weekly, it is still good practice to keep the appointment schedule going so you are always aware of what you need to address. You also may wish to keep in touch with friends and family members who might share similar values and goals in order to give you support and encouragement.\r

Q: How do you handle blood sugar levels?


A: A good analogy for how we deal with blood sugars would be if you were to walk out on your front porch and your neighbor had an angry dog chasing after you; in that case you'd probably want to run away quickly because your blood sugar level could get too high and you might die from shock. However, when it comes to diabetes, our primary concern isn't whether the glucose will kill us (although this may happen at some point), but rather whether it will damage our bodies enough so that we have to take several different types of medication just to stay alive. So one thing we look for in patients is their blood glucose levels over time. It's not uncommon for patients to lose 10% or more of their body weight within three months of starting treatment, which makes them feel worse than they did before their diagnosis (or even before they became diabetic). This means that we need to monitor their blood sugar carefully during that time, since even small decreases could mean a potential life-threatening spike later.

Q: What are insulin pumps?


A: Insulin pumps are devices that allow you to administer insulin directly into the bloodstream instead of having it shipped through a pump into your stomach. You don't need to remember to take your medicine every day; you just go back to your regular dosages and let the machine deliver the correct amount.

They've also become popular for people with Type 1 Diabetes who prefer to control their blood sugar with injections. If you're considering using an insulin pump, we strongly recommend talking to your doctor about what type of health insurance you qualify for. Most insurers will cover the cost of these machines, but if you fall under an older program or are insured through a Medicaid waiver program, you might pay less, particularly if you already receive monthly insulin payments as part of your medical benefits.

3. What do we mean by ""allogeneic""?

a. Allogeneic means that the patient's tumor cells are from a genetically identical donor or a closely related individual (e.g., sibling, aunt, uncle).

b. The most common type of allogeneic transplant is the bone marrow-derived stem cell transplant (BMST) procedure. The recipient's immune system recognizes and attacks these cells as foreign invaders, resulting in an anti-tumor immune response. These transplanted cells can then be used to treat various diseases. For example, patients who have leukemia use BMSTs to help their T-cells attack the disease. Patients with other types of cancers also may receive allogeneic transplants. In general, allogeneic transplants can result in a very high remission rate (80%–90%) compared with typical chemotherapy regimens. For more information about how allogeneic transplants work, see ""Bone Marrow Transplantation"" under Surgery.


4. How does breast cancer treatment differ for those whose tumors are triple negative?

a. Triple negative breast cancer has three major components. First, it starts at one location on the body—the breast—and spreads to many different areas of the body through lymph nodes (lymph nodes usually contain multiple small organs called plexuses). Second, it is known as HER2-positive because it expresses the HER2 protein on its surface. This protein causes healthy white blood cells to destroy any abnormal cells, and this process is part of the standard cancer treatment. Third, triple positive cancer often has aggressive spread to nearby organs like bones, kidneys, or lungs. Some patients need surgery to remove some or all of their organs.

b. The first step in treatment is the decision to begin chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is considered effective if it kills 95% of the cancer cells within 5 weeks and destroys 99% within 10 weeks. However, chemo drugs must continue indefinitely to kill off all of the remaining cancer cells. A combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy is sometimes prescribed, but surgery is generally recommended before the second round of chemo is administered, since surgery will allow for more time for all the cancer cells to die off after each administration. Most patients need 1–2 cycles of chemotherapy and then 2–5 rounds of radiotherapy. If chemo fails to cure the cancer cells completely, patients will need additional rounds of chemotherapy to achieve complete eradication.

gpt2-xl_77,"Multiple sclerosis is a progressive disease of the central nervous system that results in loss or impairment of motor and sensory functions, as well as cognitive function. Menopausal symptoms may be related to MS by causing low estrogen levels (hypoestrogenism). Several studies have shown that women who experience hypoestrogenism with postmenopausal women are at increased risk for developing MS. In addition, multiple sclerosis is more prevalent among women who live longer than 30 years. Therefore, it is possible that women who take oral contraceptives will be at increased risk for MS-related symptoms if they have a history of MS.

Q: I am on oral contraceptives. Do they affect my risk for MS?A: Many factors can affect your chance of getting MS, including genetics, environmental exposures such as smoking, being overweight, and having inherited genes that predispose you to MS or other autoimmune diseases. Some of these factors include: age, gender, race, family history, education level, socioeconomic status, and how much weight you carry around. If any of these factors increase your chances of getting MS or other autoimmune disorders, then taking a contraceptive pill could reduce the likelihood of getting them.

The bottom line is that this study shows some benefit from taking birth control pills for MS symptoms, but there's no evidence to suggest that they work better than placebo.

CVD mortality rates continue to increase, particularly among middle aged people who are not yet at risk, although this trend is moderated by economic development and other factors (2), thus suggesting that we need to find a way of preventing premature death. Smoking remains one of the greatest contributors to cardiovascular disease, and smoking cessation is an important strategy for reducing mortality from all causes. There are also significant health benefits from consuming whole grains, vegetables and fruit, including lower incidence of colorectal cancer, stroke and dementia (3).

I know there are people who are not comfortable or don't understand MS but I try to be as open about what I do here so people can learn from me and not feel embarrassed by my disability.

Q: How did you get involved in the study?\nA: The study was initiated by an anonymous donor, but I was offered an opportunity to participate after being invited by my supervisor. She asked me for help getting a sample of blood into the lab as we were planning a follow up on some samples collected during our previous research project. It took me just over an hour to complete the form and send the blood back, which is fairly typical for this kind of thing, but I didn't think much of it until months later when the first results came through. I began researching on MS in 2011, and it wasn't until the second half of 2012 that I started learning more about the condition and how severe it really is. My initial reaction upon finding out about the possibility of MS in a friend was pretty negative because we had already been talking about MS for years. Since then though, things have gotten better for her. She has gone on a total of five medications that have helped significantly improve her symptoms (some of them are experimental) and she's still alive today. When I found out about MCS, I immediately got interested in learning more about the disease, especially since so many other researchers have been studying the illness for decades. I hope to contribute to helping others like myself become aware of the MS process and the importance of taking care of themselves and their loved ones.

gpt2-xl_35,"Yes. The dietary plan proposed by Dr. Atkins and adopted by many athletes is good for people with diabetes because it provides adequate amounts of essential fatty acids, protein and carbohydrates to provide an energy source that doesn't result in excess weight gain or high blood glucose levels. It also eliminates the need for insulin injections and/or diabetic medications. For those who have difficulty keeping the diet low enough to allow sufficient calories from fat, a diet higher in carbohydrate (about 40-45%) may be more appropriate. This allows greater body fat storage and allows for a slower rate of fat loss than if all calories were from fats and proteins. However, ketosis can be achieved on a low carb diet even when the person does not use any medication. A very healthy adult should aim for a carbohydrate intake of no more than 20% of daily calorie needs; however, a few weeks before starting the diet, the amount should be reduced so as not to put undue stress on the kidneys.

Ketosis

Ketones are produced during starvation and the rapid oxidation of fat. They are used by the brain to metabolize carbs, which leads to feelings of satiety, but they become toxic at high levels, resulting in symptoms such as headaches, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, cramping, anxiety, irritability and depression. Ketone bodies in the urine can indicate an infection, especially in infants and children and in cases of cancer treatment. Some studies show that chronic ketosis results in increased brain metabolism in nonobese patients.

Breathing Rate

The breathing rate is affected by several factors including the air volume, the temperature, heart rate, muscular tension, airway resistance and the presence of obstructive lung disease or pneumonia. The higher the oxygen content of the air, the faster the heart beats (oxygen consumption). Oxygen is needed for the respiratory system to function properly and is critical for healthy cardiovascular functions. If the oxygen supply is compromised, the body's metabolism slows down, leading to exhaustion and lethargy. Higher breaths per minute increase the risk of dying from hypoxia. Breathe slowly and deeply into your diaphragm for three breaths, then hold them for ten seconds. Repeat this every five minutes for one hour until you feel better.

In case you find yourself getting exhausted while using this method, try breathing through both nostrils while standing up. In this way, you will maintain a constant flow of oxygen throughout your lungs.

The shoulder girdle muscles include biceps brachii (the muscle on top of the arm), levator scapulae (a thin band at the back of the shoulder blade) and pec major (front deltoid).

The shoulder girdle muscles are responsible for keeping us upright, especially when we're sitting. They are also involved in maintaining our balance and controlling our body movements. In fact, a study done by researchers from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center found that people who regularly perform pushups have better hand-eye coordination than those who do not. This ability to control one's own movement while maintaining bodily equilibrium allows them to be more efficient with their time, as well as more confident and alert.

Q: What is the risk of developing MS in young adults?

Mortality rates from MS increased with age until about 40 years, when they stabilized and then began to increase. At younger ages, people develop more often relapses, which can lead to disability or death. The number of new cases has been increasing for several decades. MS also affects an estimated 11 million Americans today, although it's not clear how many will have a history of the disease by 2030. There are no known prevention strategies. People who already have MS should be screened regularly using standard screening tests.

Q: What causes MS?

The main cause of MS is a change in myelin sheath—the fatty substance that surrounds nerves—in the brain and spinal cord. This tissue loses its protective coating as people get older. Normally this coating protects nerve fibers so signals travel properly between cells and signal centers. But during the early stages of MS, the sheath may break down, leaving the brain vulnerable to damage. This breakdown triggers inflammation and immune response. Eventually, white blood cells called T cells attack brain cells and their connections. These attacks trigger permanent changes in the brain's electrical activity (called demyelination). Over time, lesions in the brain become smaller and less well-defined, affecting what parts of the brain function properly.

Another way the body responds to MS is through autoimmunity, where antibodies are produced against specific proteins that help control the symptoms of the disease. Autoimmune diseases often occur alongside other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, causing joint pain, fatigue, and joint swelling.

Finally, there are genetic factors. A person's chance of getting MS increases if both parents have the disorder; if one parent gets it, the chances go up even more. Although the exact genes involved in MS aren't fully understood yet, researchers believe some of them contribute to inflammation.

People who carry these mutations tend to have an increased risk for MS and die earlier than others.

Q: How does MS affect the central nervous system?

In the central nervous system, MS affects a group of nerve cells called Schwann cell axons, which extend into deep structures like the cerebrospinal fluid and the retina. They form myelin sheaths around neurons and enable communication among nerves at the level of individual fibers. Axonal loss causes problems for many areas of the brain. In the optic nerves, for example, vision is impaired because",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-0.2144857347011566,7,q,5,0.03431372549019608,406,2
gpt2-xl_54,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system. It affects approximately 5 million people worldwide and is characterized by motor neuron degeneration, resulting in weakness or paralysis on one side of your body, often affecting both arms and legs, along with cognitive difficulties such as difficulty walking, understanding speech and swallowing. MS can also affect vision and hearing. \r

The most common symptoms are muscle stiffness, fatigue, pain, loss of coordination, sleep disturbance, depression, and fatigue, which may be severe enough to prevent you from doing daily activities or cause significant functional limitations that limit your ability to perform everyday tasks. There may be other complications associated with MS that require additional treatment such as blindness or problems with movement and balance. In addition, there is currently no cure for MS. \r

You should seek medical care immediately if you experience any of these symptoms: sudden, unexplained weakness; numbness or tingling sensations; trouble seeing, including darkening of vision; hearing impairment or disability (difficulty understanding spoken language); trouble swallowing; shortness of breath (dyspnea); breathing problems, particularly when coughing; or other signs of a respiratory infection. \r

Diagnosis of MS can be complicated because many patients do not know they have MS until their condition becomes disabling and becomes life threatening. This can make early detection difficult even with rapid diagnostic testing such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\r

There are several ways to determine whether or not you have MS. These include physical examination and laboratory tests such as a blood test for antibodies to auto-antibodies, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and a spinal tap exam. Also, you will need to provide information about medication use (including current dose, frequency of use, and duration) and use of medications you took prior to onset of symptoms. If you were diagnosed with MS within the last six months, you will likely need further evaluation by your physician. However, some individuals who have been undiagnosed for years and show very little symptom symptoms still have advanced lesions in the brain caused by MS. Diagnosing MS at this point may result in misdiagnoses. Even after this period, if there are other symptoms present, or if you have other underlying health conditions, you must continue to see your doctor until you receive a definitive diagnosis. You may need to undergo additional evaluations throughout your lifetime if new evidence emerges during this time.\r

gpt2-xl_51,"There are various definitions of the term ""holistic"" depending on who you ask, but there really isn't a universal definition. It basically means that when we think about health care, we need to make sure that all of our interventions or treatments for illness have at least some of their roots in science. This means focusing on things like nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress management, environmental conditions (like air pollution), medication use, etc., rather than treating illnesses based on outdated ""natural"" remedies. For example, many people have heard of homeopathy as an alternative treatment option, but few realize how outdated this concept actually is. Homeopathic remedies work by manipulating substances like minerals or organic compounds such as essential oils or plant extracts without actually testing them in a laboratory or making any chemicals themselves. They rely instead on traditional knowledge derived from the natural world, which can be very hard to come by. In other words, homeopaths do not synthesize the compounds they use in their remedy; they simply take these components naturally occurring in nature—and sometimes even mix them up with something else—to create an oil that has properties similar to those found in nature. Because of the lack of standardization and regulation around homeopathic medicines, one must be extremely careful when choosing whether or not to treat a particular ailment with a homeopathic remedy. In addition, no scientific research has ever confirmed or debunked any specific claim made by homeopaths, so it's difficult to know if a remedy actually works. \NIn addition, because there are no guarantees that using homeopathy will work for every illness, it also doesn't mean that the alternative medicine itself should be ignored. Some may find that taking part in a complementary therapy program allows them to reduce their anxiety symptoms while still being fully supported by the healthcare system. Other patients may benefit from regular visits to a medical doctor who provides the support they need to live healthy lives. The bottom line is that holistic medicine takes into account all factors involved in improving health. As an example, if a patient comes in complaining of chronic pain, he needs to focus on ways his diet, activity level, physical fitness, lifestyle choices, stress levels, social connections, depression and other mental issues contribute to his overall health status.

And yet, when scientists talk about a scientific principle they don't like, such as HIV causing AIDS, we are expected to accept that the theory has not been proven. Why should the public believe a statement that hasn't been proven? As a matter of fact, we wouldn't want to accept something without proof either. We need to go on believing what our senses tell us, whether it's true or false. This may sound absurd, but it's a pretty simple concept; we need to trust our senses, especially since many of these same scientists who say HIV causes AIDS are also members of the medical establishment which says HIV does cause AIDS. But again, why shouldn't we believe their sense? If science teaches us anything, it teaches us how to think critically. Q: Do doctors actually believe that HIV causes AIDS? A: Well, no one is going to take your word for it. The doctors we spoke with said yes, they definitely believe that HIV causes AIDS. Dr. Andrew Wakefield is probably the most well-known. He wrote a very famous paper back in 1998 claiming that this virus caused AIDS in some people (as he termed it) and the Lancet newspaper published his report. The report had to be retracted by the Lancet after extensive criticism from numerous medical authorities, including the chief editor himself. In 1999, the British government appointed him to head a panel of experts looking into the safety of the MMR vaccine. In 2002, the British Medical Journal investigated Dr. Wakefield's work and found that not only did he misrepresent the data he presented, but his study methodology was ""fundamentally flawed."" The journal further concluded that it was ""virtually impossible"" to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing the MMR vaccine to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine because those vaccines contain both live viruses and dead ones.

The common pathway of fatigue (also known as the'motor fatigue syndrome') is characterised by a pattern of muscle weakness, muscle twitching or tingling sensations in the arms or legs that persists for days to weeks or even months after a period of rest, and is more likely to occur with physical activity than without it. This fatigue occurs at a time when muscular strength has returned to normal. Muscle weakness, or stiffness may result from damage to the muscle fibres themselves which are not completely healed. These damaged fibres can no longer conduct electrical impulses normally. Muscles become unable to contract effectively and are less able to produce force. It is this loss of voluntary energy output that makes some people feel tired, and it leads to a feeling of being physically exhausted during the day and even throughout sleep. However, there is much debate over whether such feelings are actually due to fatigue rather than some form of muscle damage. In the absence of any exercise, the muscles will lose their ability to supply energy and so start to deteriorate, leading eventually to fatigue-related symptoms. 2. Motor fatigue is often caused by an imbalance between nerve cells in the spinal cord. It is believed that this can be prevented by restoring the balance and preventing the release of neurotransmitters that cause the problem. The most effective way to restore the balance of these neurotransmitters is through exercising the body's motor system. Exercise helps to reduce levels of lactic acid produced by the contracting muscles and also stimulates the body's immune system. 3. The 'ticking' effect seen following strenuous exercise could well be due to the fact that the nervous system is still working on recovering from the effects of the previous bout of exercise. As it recovers, the nerves grow stronger again, allowing them to communicate quickly and efficiently with the brain. 4. Some theories suggest that the reason for prolonged muscle pain in MS patients is the gradual destruction of myelin around damaged axons, but a recent study into patients who had been treated with antimalarial drugs shows that in all cases the inflammation was not due to breakdown of myelin, but to the failure of the drug molecules to cross the blood-brain barrier properly. 5.

What is the role of omega-3 fatty acids in obesity?

Omega-3s are found primarily in fish, so a diet that excludes fish and includes animal foods can be an effective way to reduce the level of omega-3 fat consumption in the body. This may help prevent or delay the onset of metabolic syndrome and other diseases associated with the development of chronic inflammation, such as atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).


Dietary supplements containing alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) have also been shown in some studies to lower triglyceride levels in both healthy individuals and those who had recently developed heart disease. ALA has also been shown to lower blood pressure. A supplement containing 800 mg of ALA each day was studied in overweight women after they were advised to avoid animal foods. The dietary intervention resulted in significant weight loss but did not affect fasting blood sugar levels. After one year, HDL cholesterol increased by 3% and LDL cholesterol decreased by 5%. However, no change occurred in triglycerides, which remained unchanged in these women. At the conclusion of this study, it was concluded that omega-3 fatty acids could be considered to protect against cardiovascular disease when combined with a low carbohydrate diet. These findings support further investigation into the potential benefits of ALA supplementation.

Who Should Get Tested For Multiple Sclerosis?

MS affects people from all walks of life. It's also affecting children, teens and young adults who haven't yet developed symptoms. Some people with MS have no history of it, while others have had it for years or decades. People with MS often don't know they have the condition because it doesn't affect the way they think, feel or behave. It does occur more frequently in women than men. Also, some people develop multiple sclerosis before the age of 50. This means that someone under 45 might develop MS at any time during his or her lifetime.

How Is MS Diagnosed?

The symptoms of MS usually start suddenly. They then become worse over a period of months. When the MS breaks out, the symptoms get worse even when the patient has no other health conditions. When the disease progresses into an advanced stage — called relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) — the symptoms worsen over several weeks or months. Although some people experience only mild to moderate symptoms of MS, most people with MS have debilitating symptoms, including difficulty walking, blurred vision, muscle weakness, depression, fatigue, sleep problems and numbness, tingling or burning sensations around the head or neck.

Why Do Some People With MS Have No Symptoms?

Some people with MS experience symptoms like those of low back pain, arthritis, headaches, tiredness and/or mental confusion without having a neurological disorder such as spinal cord injury, stroke, dementia, or HIV infection. Other people experience symptoms that are very similar to those of MS but don't need further medical evaluation by a doctor. If there's no clear cause for your symptoms, your primary care physician will likely diagnose you with MS.",68,List of multiple sclerosis symptoms,-0.217891439795494,3,q,5,0.013574660633484163,400,22
gpt2-xl_57,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. The main symptoms are nerve damage, loss of muscle control and sensory impairment in the affected areas of the body. When these symptoms begin, they may be mild or severe and may require medical treatment and sometimes surgery to relieve their effects. A person with MS can have two or more different types of MS at any one time. There is no cure for MS, although there are treatments that improve the symptoms of people with this form of the disease. For example, medications known as ""biologic therapies"" include drugs taken by mouth and intravenously that target the brain and spinal cord where MS-causing proteins are present. Other medicines used to treat MS include beta blockers, which slow down the immune system's response to attacks from the white blood cells called T lymphocytes; immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids; anti-inflammatories like acetaminophen, ibuprofen and naproxen; and antibiotics such as erythromycin and tetracycline.

Treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome by interferon beta-1a therapy

The effect of intramuscular interferon beta-1a therapy on the progression of chronic fatigue syndrome in healthy volunteers has been evaluated in three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. The results have shown that there is a statistically significant improvement in fatigue severity as measured by the Pittsburgh Fatigue Inventory score at 12 weeks from the start of treatment. In addition, the percentage of patients who responded to the first dose of interferon was similar between the active (10 mg/day) and inactive (placebo) groups at 4 weeks (12%). This suggests that this drug may be useful for treating fatigue associated with chronic fatigue syndrome. Furthermore, when compared with placebo, the incidence of adverse events was significantly lower in the interferon group at baseline (3% versus 10%, respectively). At 24 weeks posttreatment, there were no clinically meaningful differences between the two groups in terms of quality of life or other measures related to disease activity. Further studies are warranted to evaluate whether higher doses of interferon β-1a or its main metabolite interferon beta-1b could increase fatigue severity in some patients.

Efficacy of intrathecal administration of interferon beta-1a in the treatment of refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)

In vitro cell culture and mouse model studies indicated that intrathecal injection of interferon beta-1a administered by subcutaneous route could stimulate proliferation of human B-lymphocytes. These effects appeared to be mediated through the inhibition of cyclin D1 expression. Intrathecal immunization against an adjuvant containing the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, autologous bone marrow transplantation, or both, increased the numbers of CD19+ cells in vivo. Administration of high levels of interferon alpha-2b (40 μg/kg), the highest dose tested to date, significantly decreased the number of CD19+ cells but did not alter cytokine production. In conclusion, intrathecal delivery of interferon alpha-2b appears to enhance allogeneic B-cell expansion and the function of the immune system.",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-0.0523174814879894,23,q,5,0.17293233082706766,336,15

Q: Do you have any concerns about how your research will impact on our understanding of the causes of MS? If so what might these impact on our understanding of MS?\nA: We believe we have found a possible mechanism for how MS develops and we plan to examine this further with larger scale studies. However, we do not expect our findings to alter current treatment guidelines and treatments. For example, given that current therapies target only symptoms, it does not appear likely that our results would change the way we treat MS patients or contribute towards developing new ways to diagnose MS, because currently only one biomarker is used and MS is diagnosed through clinical examination using MRI scans. Another reason that we don't anticipate changing existing drug development programmes is that although drugs have shown some efficacy in treating certain aspects of MS, they have no effect on how MS progresses.\r

There may also be issues about insurance coverage. This is something that should be discussed by your doctor and/or neurologist. Some people are not able to have more than one child, so if you do decide to adopt another person who has MS, there may still be additional costs involved. You should speak directly with those individuals before deciding on additional adoption. Q: Is there anything else I should know about adoption?\nA: The process of adopting an individual living with MS must be approached carefully. If possible, it is best to work closely with your doctor and other medical professionals before starting the adoption process. Most people who are considering adopting have been through at least one MS diagnosis, and most of them have experienced MS symptoms for longer periods of time than we would like, especially as adults. They may be afraid of losing control of their body. And they may be uncertain about what they will feel and think when the time comes to make such a significant life change. In addition, many people with MS become re-diagnosed periodically. We encourage anyone contemplating an adoption to seek out information about the risks associated with MS and the risks associated with pregnancy and childbirth. It is important to note that the risk factors for MS are different for each patient. For example, some people with MS experience exacerbations of the disease after being diagnosed with MS during adolescence, while others do not. All these factors play into decisions about what kind of care someone needs prior to, or during, an adoption. A complete discussion between you and the adoption agency about your individual situation and its specific risks and benefits is very important.",79,Can I pass multiple sclerosis to other family members?,-0.1350855678319931,0,q,5,0.0,320,10

B: The risk of developing multiple sclerosis depends on a number of factors including the amount and type of radiation exposure, the person's age and other conditions that may be present at the time of exposure (such as cancer), and the individual's genetic susceptibility and/or the location of their brain lesions. In addition, several types of chronic diseases can increase the likelihood of developing MS (for example, obesity, diabetes, stroke, or certain viral infections). If you have any questions about the safety of radiation for treating MS, talk with your doctor or nurse.

Q: How does radiation affect my bones?

A: Radiation affects bone mineral density in several ways: The body uses calcium from our food and drink to build strong bones. When we receive too much ionizing radiation, some of this calcium gets deposited into the bloodstream, where it can cause harmful effects. The most serious form of bone damage occurs when calcium accumulates in soft tissue such as cartilage, which becomes brittle, breaks down, and causes pain. The second-most common way bone loss occurs from radiation is during surgery. For example, during a mastectomy, patients who undergo X-rays are at high risk because they're exposed to ionizing radiation. After radiation treatment, people who had previously received bone-sparing surgery also are at higher risk because they'll need to replace these lost pieces of bone and should seek medical attention immediately if they experience any problems. Also, while many cancer treatments involve using radiation to destroy diseased cells, the amount of radiation used for treating solid tumors may not reach all of the cancerous cells. This means more normal healthy cells will be destroyed by radiation, increasing risk of cancer.

A: The most frequently observed adverse reaction to the ketogenic diet is an exacerbation of asthma. One study reported that in the course of 6 weeks, patients on a very-low carbohydrate diet had significantly higher levels of allergic symptoms than those who ate normal diets.6 Also, an early pilot study using high fat, low carb diets for children with acute rhinitis found that these diets led to more asthma attacks than a conventional ""asthma only"" diet.7 A number of other studies have shown that those on a very-low carb diet have a greater incidence of allergic rhinitis as well.8-12

Possible causes include hypoallergenic foods, such as soybean oil; the use of antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine or albuterol; and the addition of probiotics to food.13,14 In one small study, probiotic supplementation reduced wheezing episodes by nearly 60%.15 Another study showed no difference between probiotics and placebo in reducing febrile reactions.16

Q: What is the mechanism behind the effects of ketosis on inflammation?

A: Ketones are potent antidiabetic agents. They are also antiatherogenic because they bind directly to iron stores and prevent them from being oxidized by free radicals and subsequently activated by inflammatory processes.17 These mechanisms help explain why patients on the ketogenic diet often have less severe forms of insulin resistance and less disease activity in their pancreases.

In the past decade there has been growing interest in understanding how the ketogenic diet may be useful against several inflammatory diseases, including obesity, type II diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, lupus, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).18 Some scientists believe that the ketogenic diet could even aid in treating cancer through its ability to lower blood glucose levels and increase ketone bodies.19 However, a review of published randomized controlled trials did not find any evidence supporting this possibility.20

Although most clinicians are familiar with the benefits of diet modification in the treatment of various inflammatory disorders, few are aware that some inflammatory conditions can respond favorably to dietary intervention. This situation reflects an unfortunate history in which many physicians were trained in Western medicine and the traditional medical approach was assumed to be superior to alternative approaches.21 As noted above, however, recent research suggests that the role of",113,asthma and covid,-9.842000961303713,183,q,5,0.8356164383561644,377,9

Foam Roller Massage

This is a classic and has been proven effective when it comes to relieving stress, improving posture and reducing pain. This method involves rolling a foam roller around various parts of the body, like the feet, ankles, hips, knees, chest and abdomen. Start by rolling the outside of the thigh and knee joint. Next move along your inner ankle bone, through the hip flexors and then down into the groin area. You'll find that you're not going to have to roll much farther than this to begin to notice benefits. There will be some initial discomfort, but after only a few minutes of treatment you should start to see some improvements in posture and reduce any pain associated with muscle strains. The best part about this technique? It takes literally no time at all to do. All it requires is a pair of comfortable shoes and a foam roller. You can even use a small tennis ball for extra pressure if you'd prefer. For more information, check out our article Foam Rolling for Pain Relief.

How To Do It: Begin by lying face up on your bed or chair with your palms flat on the floor.

Caring for someone who has been treated with TAP is very similar to caring for any other cancer patient. These are some of the important things you should consider if you have a child under 16 years old:

Check your child's mouth, nose, ears and eyes for signs that he or she may be developing serious skin infections. Make sure they get medical help as soon as possible.

Ask a doctor about all medicines your child takes to make sure there isn't an allergy to anything in their medicine cabinet. It can take time to find out if you're allergic to something in a medicine; even after taking it for a while. If you notice symptoms from any medication your child takes, tell your doctor right away so they can check it before giving the medicine to your child.

If a child needs extra care while being treated by a doctor, do not hesitate to ask them what will happen to your child once the treatment is finished. If you believe your child is at risk of getting dangerous side effects, talk to your doctor about how long they should wait to see another doctor until your child is well enough to go home.

Talk to your child's doctor about whether the treatment schedule for treating a rare form of cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This form of cancer rarely occurs in children but requires special management and includes chemotherapy and radiotherapy. All children with ALL are considered high-risk and require regular follow-up visits by doctors to monitor their condition and treatments. In addition, many children receive bone marrow transplants (BMT), which can save lives when paired with aggressive chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Talk with your child's doctor about if BMT would benefit him or her. They'll decide how often these visits will be needed and whether you should continue to pay for the services until your child is ready to return home.",101,heavy flares swelling lymph nodes,-11.217778205871582,80,q,5,0.6504065040650406,359,2

1) The most eco-friendly way to eat is to eat lots of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts and seeds. Most foods are better than just meat or dairy products in this regard. In fact, vegetarians are healthier and live longer than their omnivorous counterparts.

2) Meat is also a huge source of fat (about 90%), so it's important that we avoid the saturated fats that come from animals. Instead, choose plant oils like canola, corn, safflower, etc., which provide more healthy omega-3 fatty acids. These omega-3s help fight inflammation while lowering cholesterol and triglycerides. Eating these oils also helps lower blood pressure, reduce risk for heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and prevent obesity.


A recent study showed that even the best vegetarian diet could not save us if we ate more animal products than we needed because our body would just convert them into cholesterol anyway. So eating more plants may actually make us less healthy by raising our intake of harmful omega-6 fats.


Bottom Line: Plant-Based Diets Are More Nutritious Than Animal-Based Diets

As you saw above, there are many factors that influence your health and well being — including age, sex, socioeconomic status, exercise level, stress levels, lifestyle choices, genetic makeup, and genes. This means that different people will be affected differently by changing their nutrition and getting enough fiber.

These symptoms are similar to those seen in children with acute or long-standing anemia, indicating that the disorder is a form of primary amenorrhea, which may be related to low thyroid function. Thyroid dysfunction has been suggested as a possible cause for the onset of PMDD [25]. The condition can also occur after gonadectomy due to decreased secretion of luteinizing hormone during treatment. Women who have undergone a hysterectomy may experience the first phase of PMDD before the full symptoms begin. Pregnancy may precipitate PMS, although it does not necessarily lead to PMDD. However, women undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy often develop a secondary hormonal imbalance, possibly affecting their mood state. In some cases, there seems to be an association between PMS and menopause [26].

PMDD may present as hyperthymic episodes lasting from several weeks to many months during which one feels irritable, depressed, anxious and/or ""off."" It is also characterized by depressive episodes lasting 3 to 6 months, usually occurring when a woman experiences stress. This type of depression generally arises out of negative emotions such as guilt, shame, anger, self-blame, anxiety, frustration and frustration about work problems, family relationships, relationship difficulties, sexual relationships, or financial problems. Symptoms of emotional distress include loss of appetite, sleep disturbances, feelings of fatigue, poor concentration, lack of interest, feeling teary, increased sadness, decreased libido and increased hunger. Women typically seek help from others, but if they do not receive any help, they will feel isolated from society. They experience more social isolation, less ability to maintain friendships, and are more likely to live alone than women without PMDD. There are no known medical treatments specifically directed toward these symptoms, however, medications like antihistamines, antidepressants, beta blockers, antihypertensives, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and SSRIs may be used by people suffering from PMDD [27,28]. Other than psychotherapy, which is considered effective for treating major depression, other treatments used for PMDD include exercise programs, cognitive behavior therapy, yoga, acupuncture, hypnosis, biofeedback, meditation, and mindfulness practice.

If you have type 1 or 2 diabetes, the cause of this disease is unknown, but you may have inherited certain genes from both parents who carry the gene for type 1 or 2 diabetes. The genetic makeup of each person's body determines whether they will develop type 1 or 2 diabetes.

Diabetes is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks the cells of your pancreas, causing them to produce too many insulin-producing beta cells (called beta cells). This causes high levels of blood glucose to build up inside the bloodstream. High blood glucose harms the brain and other organs. People with Type 1 diabetes must take insulin injections every day in order to keep their blood glucose under control. Some people need only occasional daily injections because their bodies make enough insulin by themselves; others require frequent injections to prevent damage to vital organ systems. Because diabetes is often not diagnosed until a child reaches adulthood, children are at risk for developing the disease when they are younger than 6 years old. There are currently no treatments to cure diabetes, although lifestyle changes such as exercising more and eating fewer carbohydrates may help control symptoms. A number of drugs may also be prescribed for diabetes patients. These include metformin, glipizide and liraglutide, which work by lowering blood pressure and improving insulin resistance. In addition, medications used to treat epilepsy can reduce or eliminate seizures associated with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded a study to determine if increasing fat consumption could lower blood cholesterol levels and, therefore, lower the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke. Results showed that individuals with a higher intake of saturated fat had smaller increases in LDL cholesterol compared to those consuming less saturated fat. However, the researchers did not find any significant difference in total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels between groups consuming different amounts of dietary fat. This finding suggests that higher dietary saturated fat does not appear to significantly increase the risk for coronary artery disease or its complications. Further research is needed before these findings can be applied in clinical practice to decrease the risk of heart problems.",45,Can diabetes be cured?,-0.0094836438074707,1,q,5,0.007936507936507936,384,9

The key to dealing with your back pain that's causing the most problems for you right now isn't so much what type of pillow or mattress you're using, but rather how and where you're sleeping on it! The first thing we do when waking up in the morning is get out of bed and stretch our bodies out to ensure they are fresh from sleep. Then we take a walk around the block until we have all day energy left. Our bodies need time to fully recover from sleep and not only will this help reduce tension in your back but it will also prevent stress-induced cramps, which can cause permanent damage to your spine. You should try stretching as many times throughout the day as possible to make sure your muscles are as flexible and strong as possible during the rest of the day. You may want to start by doing some simple stretches every hour or two like these ones here.

Step 3: Take an Epsom Salt Bath \nB: We love taking baths because it helps us relax and rejuvenate. If you don't know about Epsom salt therapy, it's kind of like having a hot steamy bath without the burn. Epsom salts dissolve calcium deposits in your body which makes them less likely to lodge and become hard spots later in life. For example, if you haven't been getting enough exercise then you might be prone to osteoporosis later in life. This would be prevented by taking a daily Epsom salt bath. One teaspoon of Epsom salt has about 1/4 teaspoon of sodium chloride and it helps keep your skin hydrated. It won't remove toxins from your system as long as you take care of those first. Soap is great for soaking in, but if you're not comfortable with doing this or are worried about the soap damaging your skin, there are other ways to detoxify that work just as well. Here are some ideas on how to do one yourself...

Step 4: Get More Sleep \nA: Sleeping more will go a very long way towards helping relieve pain. Many people who suffer from chronic back pain tend to feel ""stuck"" at night. They aren't able to fall asleep easily and instead are constantly struggling to stay awake during the early hours of the morning. There are tons of ways you can combat this, including using your alarm clock when you wake up so that you don't have to fight against your own body's natural circadian rhythms.

What are the benefits to my health if I use condoms?

If you have sexually transmitted disease (STD), the health risks from condomless sex may be reduced by using condoms. Condoms reduce the risk of contracting certain STDs such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. A study conducted in 1995 showed that women who were not currently having intercourse had a higher incidence of Chlamydia compared with those whose sexual activity included vaginal intercourse. [2]


Condom use has also been shown to decrease the risk of HIV infection. According to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) there is no scientific evidence to indicate that it increases the risk of acquiring HIV. The NCHS recommends against the use of male latex condoms because they do not protect against all viruses, bacteria, or other substances that can cause HIV transmission. Condom use protects both partners during vaginal and anal intercourse; however, it does not protect against genital herpes.


The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) concurs with ACOG's guidelines regarding condom use.[3] In particular, the ACOG recommends the following when using condoms for the prevention of HIV/AIDS:[4]

Use only one condom per encounter, unless there is a medical reason for more than one condom. Condoms will not prevent HIV from entering the body through the penis, vagina, anus, mouth, eyes, or other openings in the body. For these reasons, condoms should not be used with receptive oral sex. Use lubricant on the outside of the condom to help reduce friction between the man's skin and the woman's skin and prevent penetration; this may make it harder for the man to put a condom on correctly.

Use multiple condoms for every sexual encounter, even if both partners are HIV positive, since the virus survives on surfaces for up to 24 hours after ejaculation. Although most people who have unprotected anal intercourse won't become infected, others have been infected and can transmit HIV to their partner.

Consider an STD testing service or health clinic prior to each new sexual relationship. This way, you know what to expect and can take precautions before",126,birth control suppression antral follicle count,-8.994361877441406,18,q,5,0.15384615384615385,390,1

It wasn't until the mid-1970's when we began to see these new symptoms in our patients that we realized that this is indeed an autoimmune disease. The early treatment for this type of illness was largely based on immunosuppressive medications that were supposed to prevent or reverse the disease. However, in many cases they did no good at all.

Q: What is the most common reason why people experience MS symptoms?\nA: We now know that MS can be triggered by over exposure to a variety of environmental triggers including stress, colds, flu, viruses, toxic chemicals, air pollution, toxins from household cleaners, pesticides, food additives, etc. This list continues to grow as more research into MS is being conducted. In addition to that, there are still unknown factors involved in triggering MS including genetic differences in how the immune system works which could also increase susceptibility to MS.

Q: I've heard about certain foods causing MS, do they really cause that?\nA: Research has shown that some foods can trigger MS but you should always check your doctor if any of those specific foods have caused any signs of trouble before adding them back into your diet.


Q: How often should I check my body for signs of MS?\nA: You should look out for any symptoms like fatigue or weakness after a long period of time, especially if you haven't been active recently. If you notice any unexplained soreness, redness, or swelling anywhere on your body, please consult your doctor.


Q: How do I know when I am getting better?\nA: Your doctor will monitor your progress closely while you take the right medication and continue to keep a close eye on your health throughout your life. With proper care, even the earliest signs of MS may not become apparent and you might never know that MS had even begun!

Q: What are my obligations as an individual employee? Are there specific procedures to follow if someone needs time off for medical reasons?

MS is often diagnosed during adolescence or early adulthood, so it may not appear until later that people may have other conditions that interfere with their ability to carry out normal tasks, such as learning disabilities or ADHD symptoms. When you begin your job, it would generally be appropriate for your employer to provide you with notice of any reasonable medical restrictions or limitations. If you experience any difficulty because of these medical restrictions, or you need time off to receive treatment for them, please discuss this issue directly with your supervisor (or a person authorized by the supervisor) to ensure that your role is being properly managed. You will probably be required to take leave when you need the time off; your doctor may order additional time off without prior notice, but you should communicate with your boss before taking extra time off.

Q: Do I have to report medical problems to my employer?

Yes. Your employer must notify its employees who are covered under any applicable federal, state or local laws regarding the use of drugs or medical devices that they are not allowed to carry a firearm while performing their duties unless they obtain written permission from their employer or their physician.

When it comes to employment benefits, including health insurance, your employer must make certain coverage available to all employees equally. This means that your employer must cover your medications at no cost, even if your medication is prescribed for a ""disability."" It also requires that employees receiving disability payments continue receiving those payments until the date on which the payments cease.

In addition, your employer must allow you to transfer between groups of employees on the same basis and regardless of where you live.

Some states have passed laws allowing employers to require employees who are using drug therapy to get prior approval prior to using their medications and/or participate in group therapy. However, these laws only protect against discrimination based on disability and do not affect non-drug therapy or the right of employees to share their personal thoughts or opinions with others.

gpt2-xl_77,"Menopause is the transition from reproductive to post-reproductive health. It affects all women, but it is most common in older women (35–55 years of age) with a history of autoimmune disease or cancer, and in those who have had an intact uterus for at least 20 years. Symptoms are similar to those seen during early stages of MS, including fatigue, loss of appetite, vaginal dryness, headaches and sleep disturbances.

In addition, menopause can exacerbate MS symptoms by causing changes in blood clotting, which are also known as vasoconstrictor responses. Vasoactive substances in circulation cause constriction of blood vessels and this triggers inflammation, usually in the legs and feet. The increased risk of stroke that occurs in menopausal women may be related to the high levels of inflammatory molecules that circulate in their bloodstreams (37).

Eating disorders are one of several coexisting conditions that are thought to increase the risk of developing MS (38). In fact, eating disorder symptomatology has been associated with a higher frequency of MS among people with a family history of MS (39). Many individuals diagnosed with MS have problems with food intake (40), and some studies suggest that diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of MS (41). Omega-3 fatty acid deficiency and malnutrition can occur in both sexes during menopause (42), and vitamin D deficiency is reported to be more common in premenopausal women than in postmenopausal women (43). Both low levels of testosterone and reduced levels of estrogen in women with MS increase their risk of depression and other mood disorders (44).

Q: How much money does one need to save for retirement? What is your personal saving rate?\nA: Saving for retirement is not as easy as you might think. You should put aside 30% or so of your total salary every year in an Individual Pension Scheme (IPP) in order to have enough funds at hand to retire comfortably and enjoy life. An average middle-class Indian earns Rs 65,000 per month after tax; so a pension plan would mean that he/she will receive around Rs 18 lakh annually. This is just an example - this figure varies depending on how much you earn each month.\r


Q: Who contributes to Individual Public Provident Fund(IPPF)? Why do people contribute to it?\nA: IPPF was introduced when India had a GDP of Rs 3 trillion. While most Indians earn less than Rs 2 lakh per annum from their jobs, some earn nearly twice that amount. To help them make ends meet, the government decided to set up a system where citizens who earn under Rs 20,000 per annum could set up an Individual Public Service Plan (IPPPS), which means they would provide services like health care and education without having to pay extra fees. There are many such plans available across the country.\r


Q: Is there anything else I can do if my savings aren't sufficient?\nA: Most Indian employees only invest part of their earnings into a pension fund. So even if you start off with 10% saved, you may end up with less than 5%. The best thing you can do is take advantage of a financial advisor who is well trained in all things pertaining to IRAs.

Q: How would you manage your mental health while working?A: My wife has been my support system throughout most of my MS diagnosis process. She is by far one of the hardest working people I've ever met. When I go home she makes sure that I am well-rested and make sure that I don't take any unnecessary risks or get myself into situations that might exacerbate my symptoms. In addition, she is extremely good at keeping me on track. If I ever find myself in an emotional state, I always know where to reach her for help. At times when things start getting too much for me, I also call her for reassurance. Of course, she knows about my MS and has seen many other patients with similar conditions so she knows exactly what to expect if something happens. It takes more than just having to deal with a disease; it requires constant vigilance in managing it. That being said, there are certain things that have made it easier for us both personally. For instance, after my first few months at work, I could tell from the tone of conversations that other employees had that I was not welcome. People were afraid to say anything to me because they didn't want to upset me. However, once I started seeing the positive effect of her presence and the support others gave me, I realized that maybe this wasn't such a bad thing after all. So then I began to see some things differently. It helped that I actually shared these thoughts openly with those around me. Although I still struggle with the same issues, I now feel confident enough to share my feelings with others without fear of ridicule or blame. There is another benefit as well. One day while driving down the highway towards home, I saw two young men in a car chatting together outside of their apartment building. Suddenly, I stopped the car and introduced myself.

For instance, during World War II, diabetics were encouraged by physicians to eat whole grains and legumes and avoid carbohydrates in general. In fact, as late as the 1970s when a major study showed that low carb diets worked better than high carbs (and also showed that most diabetic patients don't respond well to either type of diet), doctors still recommended them. And since then, it has become more common to recommend low carb over the past several decades.

However, research shows that even on these very restrictive diets, many diabetics will eventually develop type 2 diabetes. This is because, although insulin sensitivity improves significantly on lower carb or no carb diets, once you go below 60 grams per day of carbohydrates, your cells actually begin to use glucose to create energy instead of fat – leading to hyperglycemia. Since type 2 diabetes occurs when glucose can't be used for fuel, this means the body needs an additional source of glucose to keep itself functioning properly. This extra glucose comes from the foods we ate before we started our carb restriction! When we restrict carbs, this extra glucose is stored in adipose tissue (fat) and liver where it creates fat storage. This results in a vicious cycle, making it difficult for people to lose weight while reducing their risk for developing type 2 diabetes. So how do we reverse this process?

In recent years there has been a huge rise in interest in using intermittent fasting to reverse type 2 diabetes. Many experts believe that intermittent fasting is not only safe but may actually help reduce or eliminate diabetes altogether! One of the biggest problems associated with Type 2 Diabetes is oxidative stress. The key point here is that insulin resistance causes oxidative stress and insulin promotes antioxidant defense against free radicals. Therefore, when we get into a metabolic state where antioxidants are lowered due to insulin resistance, we are less able to fight off free radicals which leads us to build up excessive amounts of oxidative damage to our tissues. Even though dietary carbs typically promote healthy lipid profiles and cholesterol, they also increase free radical production so this could potentially lead to increased triglycerides, LDL and HDL particles.

By removing carbohydrates for longer periods of time (e.g., 24 hours) we can turn down inflammation while simultaneously boosting antioxidants to prevent further damage.

- Physical activity may be useful in preventing certain types of cancer, diabetes and heart disease. The American Heart Association (AHA) has suggested that up to 30 minutes a day of moderate physical activity might prevent 1,600 deaths due to coronary artery disease each year. \r

- Regular exercise can also help people lose weight; however, not all overweight people need to participate regularly. \r

- It's important to get sufficient exercise as often as you can to keep your body fit. If you're already physically active, there are several ways to stay healthy. They include staying physically active throughout the week, getting at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week. These activities should not interfere with your work responsibilities and provide adequate time alone.\r

- Avoiding tobacco use. Smoking damages your cardiovascular system and increases the risk of a number of serious health conditions, such as stroke, lung cancer, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. Cigarette smoking is also linked to many other diseases and diseases that cause premature death. For more information on this topic see the CDC's website. \r

- Exercise regularly to avoid injury. This includes walking around at low speeds, climbing stairs if possible, working out by using resistance bands, and lifting weights. \r

- Preventing obesity \r

- Reduce the chance of becoming obese by eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein and healthy fat sources. Some good choices are fish, poultry, nuts, olives, avocados, olive oil, chicken and turkey breast, salmon, cheese, yogurt, beans and peas, eggs, whole grain breads, brown rice, dried fruit and dark green leafy vegetables. \r

- Avoiding sedentary behavior \r

The main goal of exercise is to burn calories. You want to burn enough calories so that when you do sit down for a meal, it will not make you hungry again. A high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet helps you reach your calorie goals. Exercising doesn't mean that you need to eat large amounts of food to achieve your workout goal.\r

How does a person's disability factor into their employment decisionmaking?

There are many important elements to consider when assessing whether someone has been discharged from military service because of disabilities. Disability is one such element; however, there can also be other factors such as whether a particular condition affects a veteran's dependents, how long they've served, or the seriousness of a particular injury.

For instance, some veterans with conditions like cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer's disease have lost their eligibility for medical benefits by virtue of having experienced too much exposure to the environment during their military service. Veterans with multiple sclerosis who experience debilitating neurological symptoms due to a brain lesion or stroke may also find themselves disqualified from receiving VA disability compensation.

This can make it difficult for employers to justify employing someone with a disabling condition.

Q: Long term effects

The study was a randomized, double blind controlled trial of 12 months duration in adults with MS who were between 25 and 75 years old. Participants received either low (12 mg/day), medium (25 mg/day) or high dose (100 mg/day) nTMS for 12 weeks followed by one year follow up, during which time no other treatment was administered.

All participants had previously been treated with at least two courses of standard care, including steroids or immunosuppressants (ie. cyclophosphamide), and any adverse events were recorded. All participants provided informed consent before participation. The clinical research department responsible for the trial reported no safety concerns related to the use of the nTMS procedure. Nervous system involvement scores assessed in all patients were within normal range throughout the intervention period. The study also included cognitive testing.

Mean cumulative efficacy over 12 weeks was estimated as follows:

= mean change from baseline on the primary efficacy endpoint after 12 weeks = 1 SD (1.0) - mean change from baseline on the secondary efficacy endpoint after 12 weeks = 0.5 SD (0.8) – 1.0 SD (0.8)

As can be seen, this study demonstrated that nTMS is safe and well tolerated in adults with multiple sclerosis while yielding improvements in many objective measures of disability.

gpt2-xl_54,"Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disease characterized by the presence of relapsing-remitting (RR) and secondary progressive (SP) lesions. These lesions are located in the brain, spinal cord or both. In addition to these two main categories of MS, there are other types which do not meet the diagnostic criteria for either RR or SP but may be associated with them. There are also some people who have no neurologic symptoms but who develop SP lesions. A person can have one type of MS and another type at different times. For example, someone with RRMS may experience occasional episodes of disability over the course of their lifetime while someone with SP may only experience one episode of disability during that same period. \nB: This is important because many doctors will suggest one type of MS as being better than the other. Many times this can lead patients into thinking they are doing all right but it doesn't take much evidence to show that you really aren't! \nC: It's important to understand that the way we diagnose a particular kind of MS depends on which part of the body is involved. For example, the CNS has been identified as the primary site of damage in the more common forms of MS. This means that in order to determine whether your MS affects the CNS at all, your doctor should see if they get enough information from the MRI to find any abnormalities. If they don't get enough information then they may recommend further tests. The most common type of MRIs used are called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI involves taking a series of images of each part of the brain with a specially designed machine known as a T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These machines detect changes in blood flow in specific parts of the brain, thereby identifying where the brain cells are damaged or injured and how the effects vary between persons. DTI measures the amount of fluid in the brain and can therefore reveal how large areas of the brain have become inflamed and distorted. Some doctors use DTI scans together with brain scans made using a technique called diffusion tensor imaging to look specifically for SP lesions. With SP lesions, it becomes clear where in the brain the affected area actually lies since they produce characteristic patterns on MRI. To identify SP lesions, SP specialist specialists use an MRI machine called a MEG and measure how much water flows through a small hole on the side of the head where the SP lesion can be seen. This allows them to distinguish between SP lesions and other kinds of MS and to make sure they're diagnosing",54,What does multiple sclerosis diagnosis include?

gpt2-xl_51,"The term ""holistic"" is used to describe the approach of treating a patient's whole body in harmony with one's internal health. A healthy body, mind, spirit and environment are interconnected. Holistically-minded doctors use medical science and clinical reasoning to determine which treatment options will best treat each patient's needs. They follow an integrative model based on physical, psychological, social and spiritual factors that all contribute to disease prevention and management. Examples of holism-based interventions include yoga, meditation, acupuncture, chiropractic care, nutrition counseling, herbs, nutritional supplements and homeopathy, among many other types of therapies. \N: When will holistic medicine become more accepted?\r


The concept of holistic medicine has gained momentum over the past 20 years as evidence has accumulated demonstrating its effectiveness for treating some of our nation's most complex and challenging chronic diseases. At the same time, though, this idea remains somewhat controversial because of misconceptions about what constitutes ""holistic"" medicine and skepticism toward conventional treatments. However, recent advances in research have provided an increasingly robust basis for belief that a holistic approach can improve quality of life by increasing general health and wellbeing. While the acceptance rate of holistic approaches is still low at approximately 5 percent (in part due to concerns regarding potential side effects), there is now mounting scientific evidence demonstrating the efficacy of these treatments against common disorders such as asthma, heart failure, cancer, arthritis, diabetes and depression. In addition, researchers continue to learn from these studies about how they work, including their mechanisms of action. Finally, there are numerous non-pharmaceutical complementary approaches available for patients who wish to incorporate aspects of holistic therapy into their overall treatment plan. For example, holistic practitioners often recommend dietary changes, herbal remedies, exercise programs, and massage techniques. Many holistic professionals also refer patients for alternative diagnoses including neurology and psychiatry when conventional care fails to provide relief for specific symptoms. Finally, clinicians should be prepared to recognize that not everyone seeking help through a traditional system will go through conventional treatment first, particularly if they believe that unconventional modalities may offer better results. As an added benefit, conventional providers must consider how to integrate new therapies or alternatives into their practices without compromising quality of care. This can mean finding ways to communicate effectively with clients while maintaining ethical standards. The American College of Physicians offers guidance for integrating complementary therapies and integrative models.\r

gpt2-xl_123,"symptoms that are due to a deficiency of thyroid hormones, such as low energy or weight gain. (see hyperthyroidism)

DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT:

Patients with mild to moderate hyperparathyroidism have no obvious signs and symptoms. However, if the condition is severe it can be treated with treatment with medication. The most common cause for this diagnosis is Graves disease, which causes progressive bone loss and leads to an increased risk of osteoporosis later in life. Patients with normal thyroid function also may develop osteoporosis, especially those who exercise excessively. Thyroid hormone replacement therapy reduces the body's production of the abnormal protein thyroxine by stimulating the body to produce more of the hormone thyroxin. This means that patients will not lose bone mass but the bones will be stronger, reducing their chances of breaking a leg. If your doctor suspects you might suffer from hypothyroidism, he or she should do several tests to rule out other conditions causing a similar symptoms, and evaluate your general health before prescribing treatment. Tests include blood samples, an electrocardiogram (EKG), a physical examination and a urinalysis, to measure levels of thyroid hormones, total cholesterol, triglycerides and a complete blood count (CBC). Blood work can determine whether there is evidence of organ damage caused by iodine toxicity, or if a person has had thyroid cancer. Your doctor may also order a PET scan, an x-ray of the chest, to check for abnormalities of the heart muscles.

TREATMENT FOR HYPERPARATHYROIDISM:

The goal of treatment is to lower TSH so that it reaches its target level of about 2.5 mIU/l while maintaining normal amounts of thyroid hormone in the bloodstream. Most patients respond well to a combination of a thyroid drug and lifestyle changes, or to two drugs taken separately. Some doctors use the same combination once daily, others take them every 4 hours. The dosage is usually changed according to the type and severity of the illness. For mild cases, all medications together may be given once daily; when the disease is severe, different medications must be used at intervals ranging from 1 week to 6 months. There is little difference in the side effects between these doses.

If you experience any unusual symptoms such as dizziness, headache or numbness after starting treatment, stop taking your pills and consult your doctor immediately. You should continue to follow your normal diet and supplements.",123,hypothyroidism symptoms,-2.820799827575684,32,q,6,0.19753086419753085,394,2

The number of questions for the first part of this questionnaire were increased. However, since both groups performed equally well during the second part and the majority of participants (56%) did not have any psychiatric diagnoses at baseline, it was decided to focus on a group with only one additional question: ADHD symptoms or behaviour\nA: behavioural \o/

When we compared our findings with those reported in previous studies [6], [7], we found no difference between the two groups regarding age (P = 0.29). The gender differences are also not significant for this subgroup as there is an equal proportion of males and females aged 18–39 years. Since several previous studies have shown that older adults suffering from ADHD exhibit reduced IQ scores [8], it can be speculated that the higher IQ score may contribute to the lower anxiety levels observed in the older adults presenting with ADHD. A previous study had demonstrated that children who present with more severe forms of ADHD show greater impairment than their peers [9]. In contrast, we could find no evidence that the presence of ADHD symptoms or behaviour was associated with poorer performance during the test. It is worth noting that none of these previous studies investigated the association between ADHD symptoms or behaviour and anxiety levels. Furthermore, many studies on the association between ADHD and anxiety symptoms and behavioural problems [10] – [13] showed that anxiety and depressive symptoms and behaviours in childhood are associated with adult ADHD, but their role has been less consistently established. An important limitation of our study concerns the small sample size and small range of symptom measures used in order to make comparisons across various studies. This is a common problem when comparing results from different samples from the same population. We therefore consider the present study to be underpowered because we used too few items per assessment session. Also, although we use validated diagnostic instruments, they are based on self-report and do not reflect clinical observations. Although the reliability of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC) is high [14], [15], its validity and reliability in the general population have never been studied.

Second, if you were able to make a living from MS once, what would your business model or other options be now that you are no longer able to work? Thanks!

A: Hi Michelle. MS affects my right side so it's hard to keep up with all aspects of business; however, I am trying to focus on building my online store as well as working with some small companies. As far as jobs go, in order to get my job back I'm going to need a new application for every position. So, there will definitely be a big adjustment for me in terms of employment but things do look good. It really does depend on your industry though. Most positions available at most large firms require a degree in something that can't be easily replaced by software. In addition, many people with MS have a full time job at home or in another field where they aren't taking care of their health. When I was diagnosed (in 2009) I knew very little about MS and didn't know how to market myself or prepare for work. It took several years before I started talking with others about my situation (I had an MS support group back then). I think it's best if you talk to others who've been through similar situations because you may find that you're not alone in your struggles. Good luck!

Q: I have three questions for you about MS - first off, What is the history of MS and who is affected? How long has this disease existed? How does the illness progress from mild to severe symptoms? Lastly, why is it still such a mystery?

A: Thank you for taking the time to read our blog. MS is not an ""old"" disease like polio, or HIV. This condition was discovered over 100 years ago when Dr John Hunter discovered a protein that caused lesions to form around nerve cells in his patients' brains. Since then we've learned more and more about how the disease progresses over time. The reason the virus causes such devastating disease today is because of its ability to escape from immune system cells known as T-cells which are responsible for controlling infection. There is currently no cure for MS. Once a person develops symptoms, the entire body becomes infected. Treatment consists of medication to control the inflammation and prevent further damage to the brain and nervous system.

Fibromyalgia

Flexibility and mobility are compromised by the muscle pain associated with fibromyalgia. In MS, there is a loss of flexibility due to the inflammation of the central nervous system, which is one reason that the symptoms often become more severe over time (e.g., after an illness or injury). Many studies suggest that the ability of individuals with fibromyalgia to walk, climb stairs, swim, swing, etc., may be reduced. The most common cause of the loss of range of motion is caused by the tightness in muscles that support the spine or neck, such as those surrounding the eyes and jaw muscles. Flexible joints can also become strained through improper posture during activities, for example, while standing, sitting, or lying down.

The muscles responsible for the movement of the head are also affected by MS, and many individuals experience headaches when they try to focus on their vision and/or move around too much. An imbalance between the brain and the spinal cord makes it difficult for people with MS to perform basic tasks such as reading, writing, or using tools. There have been reports suggesting that certain medications used to treat MS may actually worsen the physical effects of this disease, including increased pressure behind the eye, changes in vision, problems moving around, weight gain, decreased mood stability, anxiety attacks, depression, sleep disturbances, irritability, and sleepwalking.[6]

For the purpose of this article, we will consider some possible mechanisms that could contribute to the decrease in flexibility and mobility in fibromyalgia:

Damage to the nerves in the brain stem

Increased stress on the nerves in the back

Tightness of muscles around the mouth and face (i.e., temporomandibular joint dysfunction)

Muscle spasm or excessive tension

Decreased muscle tone and size

Migraines

Gastrointestinal disorders

Headaches

Nerve damage from repeated trauma (such as surgery) or drugs (eg, steroids)

Cognitive impairment

Chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)

Diagnosis

Although fibromyalgia has been considered since 1841, diagnosis has remained elusive until very recently.

There are two main types of fibromyalgia: primary and secondary. Primary fibromyalgia occurs only if it affects your entire body — i.e., you don't have any other medical conditions. Secondary fib",92,causes of fatigue in MS,-0.0482247918844223,6,q,6,0.026785714285714284,363,21

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease characterized by insulin resistance and associated with morbidity, mortality, and reduced quality of life. The prevalence of DM has increased substantially worldwide over recent decades; it now affects about 1 in 5 adults, with more than 150 million people living with this condition.1-3 In many countries, the prevalence of DM has reached epidemic proportions, resulting in an estimated 3.6 billion cases annually, or 1 in 8 persons worldwide.4 To date, there is no consensus on how best to manage DM.2 However, these issues are not new. Several decades ago, physicians recognized that, when treating patients with certain types of DM, they should avoid treatment if their blood glucose levels were too low for diabetic control or if the patient was unable to monitor his/her own blood glucose level accurately.5,6 However, in those situations where patients were able to take their blood glucose level with them, there was still a need for management strategies to maintain appropriate glucose control.7 More recently, more research has focused on understanding the factors that predispose individuals to develop diabetes, including genetic susceptibility8-10 and environmental influences such as diet11-15 and lifestyle choices such as obesity16-18. Because so many factors contribute to the development of DM, effective management of DM requires multiple approaches. The aim of this editorial is to provide current information about the relationship between diabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). We also address questions surrounding the potential benefits of weight loss interventions for DM and CVD prevention.

Type II Diabetes Mellitus Type II DM is defined according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF)/World Health Organization criteria as one which occurs due to either noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), acquired pre-diabetes (APD), or both NIDDM and APD.19 A diagnosis of diabetes can be confirmed by HbA 1c,20 fasting plasma glucose,21-23 or use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents.24 Some researchers have suggested that only 1% of NIDDM is associated with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), while up to 15% of NIDDM is related to hyperglycemia; 25 however, other investigators have questioned whether these differences would result in meaningful differences in outcomes between NIDDM and APD.26-28 Despite debate regarding the clinical significance of NIDDM, its etiology remains the same across all major",22,my risk for developing type 2 diabetes,-7.868201732635498,166,q,6,0.664,381,13

Question 5: If the patient does not respond to treatment, is there anything else you would recommend?

Yes, I would recommend additional testing such as a MRI or CT scan for MS and an EEG (electroencephalogram) for any other possible neurological problems. It might be helpful if the patient takes vitamins regularly; some studies suggest that taking vitamin B6 can slow progression in people with MS.

Are there any other side effects associated with flu shots, such as fever, headache, muscle aches or soreness?

Yes, some people experience flu symptoms after getting a flu shot. These can include fever, muscle aches, runny nose and cough. In rare cases, these may last for several days. You may also experience a mild rash around your injection site, which usually disappears shortly after the shot.

You're more likely to get an allergic reaction if you've got a cold during your visit to the doctor's office. If this happens, you need to tell the receptionist about it immediately before having your flu vaccination appointment so that they know how to treat your allergy. This includes telling them whether you've had a cold in the past or if you recently travelled outside of Canada. They'll then take appropriate measures to help manage your condition and prevent future allergies. For example, you might be prescribed medication to reduce the frequency or severity of your symptoms.

RESULTS OF THE INTERVENTION

The following are the estimated numbers and characteristics of patients who received the study drug during the 4-year follow-up period. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in age, race/ethnicity, sex, Gleason score, presence of metastases, clinical stage at diagnosis, grade, and years from diagnosis to death. For all outcomes except incidence of prostate cancer death, there was a significantly greater proportion of patients receiving finasteride compared with placebo. The proportions of men treated for low PSA level (<5 ng/ml), PSA > 5 ng/ml, positive laboratory test results, and clinically localized disease were not different among treatment groups. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels increased significantly over time and decreased more slowly in the finasteride group than in the placebo group. After the 4 year observation period, 65% of patients on finasteride had been rerandomized into placebo; the rest remained in finasteride treatment as before. No difference was found by race/ethnicity, sex, Gleason score, or baseline PSA level. Finasteride caused increases in serum testosterone concentrations up to 2 years after randomization, whereas estradiol concentrations did not change. In most analyses, finasteride increased prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels significantly above those seen with standard therapy. Although higher mean serum testosterone concentrations were observed in both groups, finasteride did not increase total testosterone concentration (Table 1). However, in a subgroup analysis that included only men with high PSA level (>5 ng/ml) and biochemical evidence of malignancy, finasteride dose was associated with an increase in total and free testosterone concentrations which reached statistical significance for the overall analysis. The addition of other drugs also influenced the changes seen, particularly for finasteride. The addition of tamoxifen, cimetidine, clomiphene citrate, warfarin, and antiandrogenic therapy showed no effect on any of these parameters. TABLE 1.

My question is, what would you do if a patient stated that they were just as sick as normal but had developed a severe cold? Would you think about prescribing them low doses of cortisone or would you go with the higher dosage? A: No one has ever said that we should put more medication on a person when their symptoms don't correspond to their illness, nor that there's anything wrong with doing so. The idea of ""medication overkill"" would be absurd. We'd all agree to that. It's not a matter of life or death. If someone says they're suffering from some sort of serious respiratory infection, then by all means, give it to them. But people say they're depressed because they can't sleep, so treat them with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like Prozac, even though they haven't been diagnosed with depression. When you tell someone that they've got a virus, and the only thing you need is something to counterbalance your immune system so you won't get sick, most of us would say, ""Yeah, that sounds great."" However, given the fact that these patients aren't necessarily depressed -- they might actually be having panic attacks or anxiety problems -- why are they being prescribed antidepressants at all? It doesn't make sense.

Dr. Bostrom gives several examples where modern medicine has failed patients, but refuses to admit that its methods may be flawed. One such example comes from Dr. Bostrom's personal experience:

My first post-doc appointment was with a physician friend of mine named Michael Lebovits. He was very experienced with treating children and adolescents.

At the time, I was a young graduate student and was working part-time as a medical assistant. So this made me feel very privileged. On the other hand, if I didn't show up for work or try to take care of my own patients, he wouldn't be able to stay at his practice or afford to continue treating them. In addition to treating kids, he also cared for severely disabled adults. And he did it without ever seeing a doctor.

Drs. McGovern and colleagues (2014) performed a case series of 22 patients with newly diagnosed nonsmall cell lung carcinoma who were treated at the Johns Hopkins Hospital between 2005 and 2012 with the FDA approved trastuzumab for their initial treatment. All 22 patients had been initially evaluated using an aggressive regimen of surgery alone or as part of a standard adjuvant chemotherapies regimen. The study included two time points during which all 22 patients had received their first trastuzumab dose; one time point was a postrandomization follow-up period in which patients continued to receive their primary therapy (surgery), and the other time point was when they stopped receiving treatment altogether. The median age at diagnosis of both the tumor site and the underlying lung disease ranged from 41 years to 65 years. In addition, five of the patients had previously received another chemotherapy drug. At baseline, all 22 patients reported having smoked on average for 19 cigarettes per day since adolescence and 15% stated that smoking affected their daily activities. One patient began smoking before he developed the disease and seven others reported that it was only after diagnosis. Patients had no significant prior history of immunosuppression including systemic steroids or any other type of immunotherapy. A total of 16 patients were taking interferon beta. Trastuzumab was started at a mean starting dose of 1 mg/kg per month (range 1–10 mg/kg per week). Patients were followed up for a minimum of four months after starting treatment. On average, half of the patients completed the entire four month observation period, whereas about 30% had a relapse, leaving 17 patients (53%) still alive at the end of the observation period. Based upon a Cox proportional hazard model analysis, 18% of the patients did not die within the year following randomization. Of those who died, 11 patients dropped out due to adverse events (including 2 deaths); three more withdrew due to death (2 deaths each). During the observation period, patients received trastuzumab approximately every six weeks at an increasing dose of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg every three weeks.

What about my physical exams?


The exam will be done by your doctor who may give you medication to help with any pain you are having or swelling. You might also be asked to use an ultrasound machine if they can't see inside your body. If there is any bleeding during the exam, it should stop right away and there shouldn't be a problem as long as the surgery goes well. The blood clot in your liver that was removed after the surgery won't return unless something else causes it to do so.

""I'm not sure I want to go back to school now."" ~ A student at an inner city high school

Many students who have experienced trauma never feel ready for college. However, many of these students do feel as though they should go to college if they haven't already. This group of students may be reluctant to apply themselves to academic pursuits because of feelings of self-doubt and guilt. Psychoeducation can help these students see that it is possible to thrive academically on your path toward higher education.\r

In addition to psychoeducation, our counseling clinic offers one-on-one support groups for undergraduate and graduate students who experience feelings of anxiety and depression during their time in college. These support groups provide students with tools and resources to cope effectively with difficult situations. In addition to the psychotherapy sessions offered through this program, our staff also provides other treatment options such as individual psychotherapy, family therapy, crisis intervention, life skills training and peer education workshops.\r

A lot of people are allergic to soy, but it's not listed in the allergy chart so it was never a problem for me before. The worst thing about the allergies though has always been when they would get bad enough that you couldn't eat any more or just couldnt stand the food anymore.

After 2 months of doing this my immune system went completely down the drain and now im literally dying every time i drink milk.

""The bottom line is that insulin is an essential hormone,"" says Dr. Michael Eades, director of the Diabetes Center at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""Your body needs insulin if it's going to produce glucose."" The more you use insulin, however, the less effective it becomes; by using it too much, your cells will eventually become resistant to its effects. This means they'll need even more insulin than before — a vicious cycle that makes diabetic symptoms worse.

To get out of this cycle, you have to either lower your dosage or increase your activity level — both of which take time. And once your body starts losing effectiveness with insulin, it may continue to lose effectiveness over time. ""You have to balance these factors carefully, but the good news is, we're making progress,"" Dr. Eades says. ""We've made significant strides toward developing medications that could help millions of diabetics who want them.""

Diabetes Treatment Options

While most people diagnosed with type 1 diabetes receive insulin injections regularly (usually weekly) through an injection pump, about 30 percent of those with type 2 diabetes must rely on oral medication to manage their condition. However, there is some variation between different types of diabetes treatment options based on your medical history and individual circumstances.

Some patients require only one type of diabetes therapy while others need two or three. Also, not all forms of diabetes treatment are appropriate for everyone. If you don't know whether a particular approach might work best for you, talk to your doctor to find out what you should do next.

For example, type 1 diabetics often prefer to avoid insulin injections, because this method has been shown to cause some side effects such as numbness in the arms and legs. In contrast, some type 2 diabetics also use insulin injections, although this strategy can increase their risk for life-threatening complications such as heart attacks and strokes.

Also, although oral medications tend to be safer than injections, you shouldn't stop taking your insulin without talking to your doctor first. It's common to notice some side effects after stopping insulin, including headache, fatigue, nausea, constipation and dizziness. Many times these issues",45,Can diabetes be cured?,-0.0111870905384421,2,q,6,0.015873015873015872,414,10

Fetal exposure to androgens can have effects on the developing male fetus. The most well-studied is hyperandrogenism, which occurs in some children who receive prenatal hormone therapy for conditions such as Turner's syndrome or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Hyperandrogenism may be detected during a routine physical examination at age 2 years by measuring serum testosterone concentrations. In girls with CAH or TS, abnormal levels of FSH or LH are frequently found. At present, there is no specific test for hyperandrogenism; however, it has been shown that FSH alone cannot distinguish between true hyperandrogenism and benign secondary hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

Other potential sources of androgen exposure include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs used in chemotherapy, oral contraceptive pills, corticosteroid use and other medications used to treat disorders of sex development. Androgens also increase the risk of breast cancer. Pregnant women should avoid taking any medication that contains norethisterone acetate, since this compound causes early puberty. Testosterone replacement therapy increases the risk of prostate cancer and other cancers of the reproductive system, including ovarian cancer.

gpt2-xl_83,"If I had an easy answer, I would say ""because the MS diagnosis is so common and so good that people assume it's pretty well established,"" but it isn't. There are lots of false positives for MS in people who aren't actually sick. For instance, I've been told that a patient with chronic fatigue syndrome who has some other symptoms is probably just depressed. And there may be a lot more to these things than a simple disease misdiagnosis. When someone gets a new neurologist at the beginning of each year, they have to prove their neurology (and sometimes medical history) on what they call ""the MR"" or ""medical records."" They're required to send back documentation about how much they slept over the past few months, how much exercise they did, whether they took pain relievers, etc. All of this is intended to tell doctors that you're not doing anything wrong with your neurological system, even if all those symptoms look like something else. Sometimes the tests are done after an MRI scan of the brain; other times it can be done right before the MRI scan. But what really matters is that they do a neuro exam, which will give them information about the way your brain processes information, especially when there's a problem. This examination is usually done with two doctors working together — one for diagnosing MS, the other for making sure everything looks fine. There aren't enough of these specialists around to test everyone every time. So many people get a new neurologist in the first year after MS diagnosis because they feel better, or they think they should be getting the same treatment they were already taking. The most important thing here is that they only diagnose you once, regardless of whether you're showing up again within the next month or year. They don't need to worry about recurrence. It's possible to learn the signs and symptoms of MS very early on, but sometimes this information doesn't come out until years later — after you've developed serious health problems unrelated to MS, like heart disease, stroke, arthritis, or cancer. There may still be a small chance that you'll develop symptoms or problems again after you recover from the initial attack. However, it's extremely unlikely, since the treatments used against the primary autoimmune process have gotten so far along that no return is anticipated.

Treatment is based on clinical symptoms, results of biopsies, imaging studies and a combination of treatments. There are two main types of metastases in this group – high grade and low grade. High grade metastatic cancers have the potential to spread through blood vessels, lymph nodes or bone marrow into other parts of your body including joints, skin or lung tissue. Low-grade tumors can become invasive and need surgery and radiation to treat. If you have early stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas such as ALL and other forms of T-cell lymphoma, it may be possible for your doctor to decide that surgery isn't needed at all and that a targeted chemo protocol will do more harm than good.

What is adjuvant chemotherapy?

Adjuvant chemotherapy can help people who already have cancer but aren't responding well to standard therapies. Adjuvant chemotherapy uses medicines that don't cure the cancer but can still make the cancer less aggressive and give you some control over its progression and side effects. It is given just before starting any new medicine to get an idea of how quickly things are progressing and what other treatments might work better. This information helps doctors choose which drug is best for each person.

Are there different types of adjuvant chemotherapy?

There are many types of adjuvant chemotherapy available today and these vary depending on the type of cancer they are used to treat. They may also differ slightly between manufacturers.

Some examples include:

Cisplatin, a form of platinum that has been shown to kill most types of cancer cells with few side effects;

Pomalidomide, another platinum compound that works by blocking the enzymes responsible for making proteins involved in cell growth;

Rituximab (Keytruda), a protein that targets a special protein found in certain immune system cells that are common among patients with chronic illnesses like rheumatoid arthritis.

This is the first reported case of perimenopausal MS in a MS patient.

Q: What are some possible mechanisms by which perimenopausal women may be at risk for developing MS?\nA: Some evidence suggests that estrogen deprivation from ovaries during the perimenopausal period may increase the likelihood of relapsing, or worsening of the disease. These findings support the notion that the menstrual cycle plays a role in determining susceptibility to MS. In addition, the presence of MS in the absence of any other identifiable cause warrants investigation as a potential cause. If a female with MS also has perimenopausal symptoms, it may well indicate a link between her MS and the hormone system. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether this is likely to occur and if so, how frequently such a relationship occurs.

Q: Does the use of oral contraceptives (OCs), particularly ethinyl estradiol (EE), alter the risk for developing MS?\nA: Although OC use is associated with an increased risk for MS, the mechanism through which OC exposure increases the risk remains unclear. It could result from the development of a proinflammatory cytokine response following exposure to OC hormones. Alternatively, OCs could induce damage to myelin sheath around nerve axons, leading to neurodegeneration and inflammation that may eventually lead to MS.

Diabetes mellitus accounts for 1.2 million new cases each year and causes an estimated $16 billion loss annually.

Q: Why is India spending so much money on health care when its population is growing rapidly?\nA: In 2002, total public expenditure was 8.77% of the Gross Domestic Product. This is the highest proportion since 1979. The share of GDP devoted to health increased steadily between 1983 and 1992 while the overall increase in healthcare expenditure came mostly from increases in the private sector. However, since 2004, when the government assumed responsibility for universal primary health coverage, public expenditure has been falling behind the growth in the economy because of rising inflation. As a result, the percentage spent per capita has fallen from 9.3% in 2003 to 7.4% in 2009. Public funding continues to be inadequate, with only 27.5% of Indians having access to quality services such as free medicines and diagnostic tests. Although government schemes cover some basic services, there remain wide disparities between states with little coherence or efficiency. Private providers provide less than 10% of primary health care; however, many low-income patients do not know that this is possible. A lack of awareness about available options limits cost effectiveness, particularly for those who cannot afford long-term medical treatment. Some believe that underfunding of health insurance makes it difficult for poorer families to secure comprehensive health protection against disease.

How long will it take to see results?

In the past, many doctors and dentists gave up trying to treat people with arthritis who have difficulty swallowing. Now, that approach is being abandoned because of a growing realization that chewing and swallowing are mutually exclusive. A patient's ability to swallow depends on his or her ability to chew, so if those two functions don't work well together, the result may be poor oral health. But this type of problem doesn't typically get better within weeks or months, so most people with arthritis need treatment for years before they start to feel any improvement in their symptoms.

gpt2-xl_132,"no, not at all. q: is there any evidence of a relationship between psoriasis and the use of topical steroids?A: It has been demonstrated that psoriatic arthritis does not occur in association with the administration of topical corticosteroids. However, it is possible that these drugs may be effective in some individuals who have psoriasis without an underlying inflammatory condition. In other words, they are likely to be more helpful if given as a second-line treatment for psoriasis (see section 4.8). q: why did the skin lesions disappear after discontinuing the corticosteroid medication?A: Although many patients experience relief from their psoriasis symptoms when the corticosteroid is stopped, in most cases this does not lead to complete resolution. At this time, we do not know whether discontinuation leads to permanent changes in the skin or in the immune system. If such effects were observed, it would indicate that the immunological mechanism of action was also modified.

4.5. Treatment of psoriasis by physical therapy and/or laser therapy Psoriasis is usually treated with antiinflammatory agents, which in turn cause exacerbation of the skin lesions. The choice of anti-inflammatory agent must balance its ability to produce adequate symptomatic control with its potential side effects, particularly allergic reactions and damage to surrounding tissues. Physical therapies such as massage, acupuncture, electrotherapy, phototherapy and laser therapy can be used alone or together with anti-inflammatory medications. Laser therapy is generally considered the preferred first line treatment, although combined treatments are sometimes recommended. Laser therapy is used primarily to treat superficial lesions but might also be useful in severe cases where deeper lesions are present (see sections 5 and 6). A systematic review found only one single study evaluating the efficacy of different levels of laser irradiation on the clinical improvement in psoriasis (Foley et al., 2002). There was strong evidence that 3 minutes of pulsed ultraviolet light at intensities ranging from 0.25–1 J/cm2 induced significant reductions in overall lesion counts (mean reduction 12%) but not specific disease areas. No adverse events were reported. Another small randomized controlled trial found no statistically significant difference in the number of relapses between those treated with 1 minute of pulsed UVB and those receiving a higher level of ultraviolet (mean relapse rate 19% vs 13%). In addition to using laser therapy, psychological interventions are often suggested as part of the treatment program. There is good evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce symptoms and improve",132,headpats scalp psoriasis,-7.083505630493164,39,q,7,0.312,402,7
gpt2-xl_94,"Your symptoms of MS are usually worse during the first few months after diagnosis. You may have a flare-up, or flare-ups can happen at any time throughout your life. The more you practice, work hard and live a healthy lifestyle, the less likely it is that you'll get another flare-up. However, if there's one thing we know for sure about MS, it's that this disease can strike at any age. So don't be surprised when, just as you're starting to feel better, you're suddenly struck down by a new attack!


What Is Multiple Sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of myelin sheaths covering nerve fibers in the brain, spinal cord, optic nerves, eyes, legs and arms. These protective sheath cells provide information that helps control muscle movement. But if these sheath cells become damaged, MS results. It affects 1 in every 68 people in the United States, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. A person with MS has two types of immune system cells in their body—T-cells and B-cells. T-cells help fight infection and B-cells help fight cancer. Each type of cell plays an important role in controlling the disease process. For example, T-cell activity controls how quickly the immune system responds to the virus that causes MS. And B-cells play a big part in controlling the degree of damage caused by MS. T-cells generally produce antibodies against proteins on abnormal white blood cells called macrophages that normally destroy infected tissues. These antibodies then spread throughout the body and stop the destruction of healthy tissue. B-cells also target abnormal white blood cells called monocytes, which are present in large numbers in the bloodstream. Monocytes act like white blood cells but do not have the same ability to kill invading pathogens. Many researchers believe that because B-cells do not kill the monocytes, the immune response becomes uncontrolled and spreads throughout the body. This leads to more severe symptoms. Because MS affects so many parts of the body, it often begins in the same area where it begins—the brain or spine. If the initial attack does not begin near the brain or spinal cord, it can progress to other areas over time. In most cases, the cause of MS remains unknown until the disease progresses to its worst stage. This stage consists of paralysis, cognitive problems, loss of vision, hearing or pain. MS can occur on its own, in conjunction with other neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's",94,When will I start to feel better with multiple sclerosis?,-0.0849919319152832,0,q,7,0.0,413,15

gpt2-xl_98,"IUDs are generally well tolerated and do not increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy. However, there is a small possibility that an IUD can lead to an infection (pelvic inflammatory disease). This could be due to the device itself or due to other factors like the woman's health history, stress levels, medication use and certain medications, such as aspirin, blood thinners, anticoagulants, HIV medications, and antimalarials. Also women with diabetes may have a higher rate of infection with TSS (toxic shock syndrome).

How should I insert my copper IUD?

Insertion does not occur by yourself - it requires two doctors' visits. The first visit happens before you leave for work or school, and lasts 45 minutes. During this time, your doctor will examine your cervix and uterus and check if any changes need to be made during the procedure. If you're having an IUD inserted at home, you'll need two more visits after you return home. Both of these visits last between 30-45 minutes each, and you'll be asked questions about symptoms during the visit to make sure you don't have anything else going on. You'll also receive instructions on how much, where and when to insert the IUD. The IUD must stay in place for 6 months to prevent expulsion, so it's important to follow all directions carefully.

Do not try to insert your IUD if you haven't had sex within 2 weeks of coming out of your period. Insertion can cause serious injury to the uterus.

If your partner has taken medications known to affect sperm, he or she should not get pregnant while using the Copper IUD.

What are some possible side effects of the Copper IUD?

The copper IUD should not cause birth defects or harm the unborn baby. Women who have never given birth should be careful about inserting an IUD. Any type of surgery, including cesarean delivery, is likely to be more dangerous than an IUD insertion. Some women experience breast tenderness during placement, but this usually goes away soon after insertion. Most women find no discomfort from their IUD. Occasionally, the uterine muscles contract around the IUD causing mild cramping and bleeding, sometimes leading to spotting and painless removal. In rare cases, it can cause pelvic infection or even scarring. A number of studies suggest that the IUD can reduce the risk of getting PID, which means an unintended pregnancy.

gpt2-xl_63,"Multiple sclerosis can impact many aspects of a person's life, including their job. The degree and severity of symptoms are affected by the number of sclerosis lesions that have developed in the brain. For example, people with active disease may be able to work well but develop memory loss or other cognitive problems. People with severe lesions are more likely to lose mobility (particularly walking), which limits their ability to do routine tasks such as caring for themselves, performing household chores, working at home, or attending school. In addition, individuals who experience repeated episodes of neurological disability will also face challenges when attempting to return to jobs that require manual dexterity. Individuals with milder symptoms may still be eligible for employment if they meet some requirements for entry-level positions. However, because these conditions cause significant limitations in day-to-day activities, it is recommended that an employer consider alternative positions within three months of the onset of symptoms. If you believe your condition might pose a conflict with your work, ask your doctor about applying for disability benefits before leaving work. A qualified agent can help you apply for coverage under your state's Social Security system. Your agent should provide information on Medicaid and Medicare programs.

Q: How often must I check my blood pressure, take medication, or visit a physician before receiving a letter stating that I am disabled?\nA: The U.S. Department of Labor does not recommend a specific interval between checkups or visits to medical providers, except for those patients whose health issues make it impossible for them to attend regular office visits. It is very important for employees to keep up-to-date with personal care needs and medication changes. It is advisable to consult a physician every two weeks or once a month for nonemergency health concerns; at least once annually for emergency situations. At any time during the year, it is prudent for all employees, especially those with chronic conditions, to contact their employers to discuss possible adjustments to their job duties and schedules so that they can remain free from disabling conditions without having to miss days or even weeks of work each year. Some workers may want to receive a copy of a letter indicating that they are disabled if they believe that this information might prevent them from getting a better job offer. However, employers cannot guarantee that an employee would receive such a letter regardless of whether they ask about it or choose to disclose this information.

gpt2-xl_52,"Many of the most common mental disorders involve anxiety, depression and other mood disorders. People with these conditions often have a variety of problems with their interpersonal relationships, work, school and family life. While people who suffer from these kinds of psychological disorders may not be able to control their symptoms, they do need treatment in order to improve their quality of life.\ n \n

As an example, some people may feel depressed because they don't feel like going out anymore, so they go to bed early rather than stay up late watching television and getting into arguments with their spouses or partners. Other individuals might develop a negative self-image due to concerns about physical appearance and weight. People can also experience a depressive episode when they feel overwhelmed by feelings of helplessness over being unable to solve their own problems.\ nIn addition, people suffering from personality disorders (such as antisocial personality disorder, paranoid personality disorder, and borderline personality disorder) may tend to display impulsive and irrational behaviors that may make it difficult for them to cope with stressors such as job loss, divorce, or illness. When coping with these issues, people with these kinds of disorders typically seek help through their doctors and therapists.\ n

Another major challenge is understanding how specific behavioral problems influence one's chances of developing a mental health disorder. For instance, research indicates that if someone has experienced childhood trauma or severe emotional abuse, they are more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The link between chronic stress and mental health problems is further strengthened by recent evidence showing that certain genetic factors influence vulnerability to PTSD and other types of mental illnesses. Research shows that certain variations in genes determine whether someone is genetically susceptible to experiencing chronic stressful events. Because certain genes affect risk for PTSD and other mental illnesses, prevention strategies may be useful during adolescence and young adulthood.\ nThe National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the American Psychological Association recommend that teens who want to reduce or eliminate their drinking should avoid binge drinking and limit alcohol intake to no more than two drinks per day for women, and three drinks per day for men.\ nDrinking too much alcohol in small amounts while under the influence of other drugs such as marijuana increases risks for negative effects on brain function, including decreased memory and concentration.\ nFor more information, visit www.americanpublichealthsystem.org/mentalhealth/pubs/.",52,What are the most common mental health problems?

In fact, there are various types of hypothyroidism available in the USA and Europe. There are two main subtypes: Hashimoto's type (a benign condition where your body produces too little thyroid hormone) and Graves' disease type (an autoimmune reaction). A few more types exist, but the majority of people who suffer from low T fall into one of these two categories.


The treatment for hypothyroidism is to take medication. The doses vary depending on the severity of your symptoms, and you will need to discuss this with your doctor. You also may need to use special dietary supplements like Armour Thyroid or DHEA-P to boost the level of thyroid hormones in your system. If necessary, surgery can also be used in some cases. Your doctor will advise you on whether to get surgery or not. Surgery is very painful but it has many benefits.

Many people have good outcomes after starting medications (usually methylphenidate) to try to get their symptoms under control. There have been some studies where people who had stimulants and behavioral treatment were more likely to do well than those who did not.

Q: how long will my child's medication last? A: It depends on the exact prescription. In general, we recommend that kids have a prescription that lasts 2 years or longer. We have found that 5 months is usually sufficient for most children. If your child gets worse or requires additional treatments, he/she should continue taking the medication for another month or so until his condition improves.

Cognitive impairment.

Dementia, cognitive, and/or emotional problems (including depression) that are not improved by treatment with a second drug or by other treatments have been reported as the primary reason for discontinuation of treatment. In addition to psychological symptoms, there may be physical manifestations of dementia such as weakness, poor balance, blurred vision, and impaired coordination, which may cause an individual's ability to perform tasks to decline. The presence of these signs should raise concern for an underlying medical condition, but they do not necessarily indicate disease progression. Some patients develop milder forms of dementia with symptoms similar to those seen in Parkinson's Disease.

Symptoms and signs of dementia include difficulty remembering things; confusion about how events unfolded earlier in life; and a loss of short-term memory. These changes can also occur without any obvious cause. In some cases, it is possible to prevent the onset of dementia by controlling the patient's activities. However, others become progressively worse over time.

Treatment with the first drug has no effect on the severity of these changes in the long term. This suggests that drugs that treat Alzheimer's Disease should target different mechanisms than those used to treat other diseases. Also, it appears that the longer a person continues to take a drug, the more severe their cognitive deficits become.

I think it's fair to say that these questions are a bit more complex than they appear at first glance. The answer you get from your doctor is likely going to depend on your age and whether or not you have a family history of the disease. For example, if you have any other kind of diabetes (e.g., gestational diabetes) then your response will be different, as will yours for anyone else in your family. If you're over 65, it's likely that you'll have fewer problems with high blood sugar and less risk of complications such as heart attacks and strokes. That said, even people who are genetically predisposed to diabetes may still develop this condition in their later years, and some people can become diabetic without ever having had symptoms. It just means there are many variables involved in determining a person's risk.

So how do you know what your risk is? Here's how I've done it so far. In October 2006, I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and became very aware of all the potential pitfalls, including those outlined above. To help me make sense of my situation, I consulted two of the best scientists in the world – Drs. Michael Graedon (NHS Blood Pressure Clinic) and Peter Reuter (University College London Diabetes Centre), both highly qualified experts in the field. At their urging, I went through a complete medical screening process and found out which medications I'd been taking and whether I was currently exercising regularly, eating healthily and maintaining a healthy weight. When I checked off each item, I felt reassured about the possibility that I could manage my disease. And yet, just days before Christmas last year, when my blood sugars were higher than normal after consuming an apple-filled lunch, I decided I didn't want to continue being a slave to them. So I changed my diet, exercised more often, got rid of most carbohydrates and switched to a low-glycaemic index food plan. And since then, things have improved dramatically!

The first thing I did was check my blood glucose levels. They were already starting to go up after breakfast but were dropping again by midafternoon, around 5pm. At 6pm, they jumped back up towards the normal range. My initial fear was that my low-glucose diets were causing me to enter ketosis, where your body becomes adapted to burning fat instead of carbs. But this wasn't happening.",22,my risk for developing type 2 diabetes,-0.7149229645729065,55,q,7,0.22,411,17

Q: What causes Multiple Sclerosis?A: It is caused by an autoimmune response in the body against myelin, which makes up the insulating covering that gives nerves their strength.


The immune system destroys the myelin layer on nerve fibers causing them to lose power and become weak or dead. Symptoms include numbness, weakness, fatigue, vision problems (blind spots), tingling, loss of balance, and difficulty speaking.


There are two types of MS:


Type 1, which affects around one-third of people with it, involves genetic mutations. This type of MS often presents itself as relapsing-remitting; if left untreated, it progresses into full-blown MS. People who suffer from this form tend to be young adults, usually between 20 and 30 years old, and are often women. In Type 2, over 80% of patients will experience progressive disability, resulting in a more severe physical condition and poorer quality of life than those without MS.


Q: How does your blood test for MS work?A: The Blood Test for MS can tell us how well your body's immune system has been functioning in recent months. If your CD4+ T cells are low or absent, you may need treatment with immunotherapy. Immunotherapy uses specific medicines that stimulate the body's own immune system to attack certain forms of the virus and other infections. Once given, these drugs remain active throughout your lifetime until they are stopped by another doctor. It is important that you see a doctor at least twice a year to ensure your treatment continues to work.

If you have had an infection for some time but have not had any medical follow-up tests, such as MRI scans or blood tests, we will contact you to schedule further testing. Your results will indicate whether your treatments are working. We do not know what side effects, if any, may occur during treatment. You should discuss any potential risks with your doctor before taking medication.

Q: What is the difference between ""phase"" of MS?\nA: Phase I (early stage) is characterized by widespread disability with no change in motor function; however, patients can walk and communicate after a few weeks of treatment; phase II (mid-stage), which occurs in people with milder or moderate symptoms, typically progresses to irreversible paralysis, but may be reversible. People who have progressed beyond this stage are called late-stage patients; they typically cannot move their legs as well as early-stage patients, but they still retain some ability to speak and breathe on their own. Finally, there's stage III, which is the most severe form of MS and usually only appears later in life. It is characterized by irreversible loss of muscle control and sometimes complete nerve damage. Patients are often left partially paralyzed or unable to feed themselves or dress themselves due to muscle spasms.

It causes a gradual deterioration and loss of motor skills over time, often resulting in death after only one to two years of age. Symptoms typically begin between ages 10 and 40 years old and may include facial paralysis (brachydactyly), limb weakness, and dysarthria (a slowing of speech) that continues into adulthood. Although HD affects men and women equally, males are twice as likely to be affected by it. Signs and symptoms can vary significantly from person to person. Most people with HD do not develop any neurological problems at all (see below for details on hereditary forms of Huntington's disease).

gpt2-xl_93,"The incidence of MS increases with age. Some researchers believe that this is because the disease has a ""fuzzy"" profile of its own, making it more difficult for an immune system to target certain types of cells as it goes on. In other words, in old mice, some autoimmune diseases were more severe than others (e.g., type I diabetes). Sleep disorders seem to be at least partly responsible for these differences. Some studies have suggested that changes in sleep may also play a role in other neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease. But we still don't know how much sleep plays a role in each of these conditions. Many medications used against insomnia can cause side effects such as dizziness, lightheadedness or drowsiness, which could complicate their use by seniors with sleep issues.

Sleep Apnea Syndrome

What is it? A condition characterized by repeated interruptions of breathing during deep sleep.

How common is it? About 3 percent of Americans are estimated to suffer from it; about 2 percent of those over 65.

Who gets it? People who sleep less than 6 hours a night have an increased risk of developing apnea. Apneas often involve episodes lasting between one minute and 30 seconds. They usually start when someone wakes up from a REM period — the period during which dreams occur and the brain temporarily shuts down its normal function. During these episodes, your mouth muscles relax and you breathe through your nose. Your heart rate slows and your respiratory movements become shallow. You then wake up without oxygen to continue to breathe until the episode ends.

How does it affect you? It can make it harder to fall asleep, especially if you're prone to falling asleep easily. If your sleep is interrupted regularly by loud noises, a sudden movement, or your partner talking, it can also trigger attacks of sleep paralysis, a waking sensation that usually occurs while you're not fully awake and causes you to feel paralyzed, although people with no history of the disorder have reported experiencing a similar feeling. These symptoms can interfere with your ability to perform important tasks like driving or performing housework. If you develop a sleep-related disability, you can find out whether there's any connection between your sleep problem and your physical or mental health.

Dr. Bruce A. Davis, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of ImmunoVec Inc. (www.immunovec.com), a company specializing in vaccines and immunotherapies for multiple sclerosis, said, ""It's absolutely ludicrous to make such claims."" He added, ""The safety and effectiveness of any drug depends on several factors, including dosage, frequency, duration, timing and mode of administration. We do have some evidence that suggests the administration of corticosteroids may delay progression of MS disease."" Dr. David H. Schoenbaum, Chairman Emeritus, Division of Neurology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York City, agreed, stating, ""There are many ways to induce an immune response, which can be accomplished with different preparations, such as vaccination, injections, infusions, or topical application. Vaccination generally induces a more robust immune response than other methods of inducing an immune response."" He continued, ""The question is whether it has a direct effect on the disease process itself, which could potentially be beneficial, or whether it does nothing useful except delay the appearance of symptoms. There is very little data available in humans regarding this issue because there haven't been enough trials. One trial did show a benefit from vaccination, but there were no placebo controls or long-term followup studies."" Dr. John Clements, M.D., Professor of Pediatrics and Head of Pediatric Allergy/Immunology at the University of Calgary College of Family Physicians, Alberta, Canada, also expressed concern about the use of the term 'vaccine' in the marketing of the anti-MS vaccine. He stated that although he had seen evidence of efficacy of steroids in patients with MS, and was concerned by the potential adverse effects of cortisone, he believed that steroids would be too aggressive a treatment for adults with MS. He noted that if steroids do help slow down or stop disease progression, they must work slowly because they only control symptom flares, not the underlying brain damage caused by the inflammatory phase of MS. Therefore, steroids alone would probably be ineffective for slowing the progress of the disease. Dr. Clements concluded, ""I am against using steroids on MS patients unless they are given through intravenous infusion.""

Possible side effects of SAVY

SARMS are not a good substitute for actual SARMS. They can cause an allergic reaction or the body reacts poorly and causes an adverse reaction. The following is one example.

Case 1: A 22-year-old male had received his first dose of SAVY, but his first dose was delayed by 12 hours due to an allergic reaction. During this time, he developed hives which caused him to stop taking his medication. He continued on his SARMS without incident until after two months had passed. On returning to SARMs, he experienced symptoms of hives (excessive itching) with no fever and increased urination that lasted 5 days. Two days later, he developed difficulty breathing in severe distress. He went to the emergency room where tests showed he suffered from acute respiratory failure. The only sign of cardiac activity was a small heart murmur. His initial EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy and was elevated for sinus rhythm. His serum TSH was 2.0 mIU/ml while his resting blood pressure was 106 mmHg. One month after receiving SAVY, he returned to his baseline health. However, after five weeks of being off SARMs, his symptoms started back up causing him to go to the emergency department again. Tests revealed that despite having been completely off SARMs for four weeks, his level of TSH was still 3.1 mIU/ml and his resting blood pressure was 130 mmHg. His EKG also showed right ventricular hypertrophy. After six weeks of SARM use, he regained all strength in his legs and was able to walk unassisted. These were all the symptoms previously present when he began using SARMs, but they did not return during followup after he stopped using SARMs.

These are examples of side effects reported by people who have used SARMs.

How will I know if my body has become sensitized to SARMs?

You may be sensitive to SARMs even though you never experience any negative side effects. You may feel like your skin is burning or tingling after taking SARMs. You may have low cortisol levels for no apparent reason, even though you normally have high cortisol levels. If these symptoms continue after you stop using SARMs, then your body may be developing sensitivity to them. This could lead to serious problems such as rashes, eczema",58,Risk to develop multiple sclerosis,-11.001272201538086,94,q,7,0.4069264069264069,389,15

However, there are several studies of children with asthma who were born in later years which suggest a small increase in prevalence with age at diagnosis in comparison to early-life exposures (Barker et al., 1983; Fombonne et al., 1984).

Q: is it possible that the increased risk occurs through chance?

A: There is no clear evidence of chance involvement. However, there are some potential confounders. First, both parental smoking and childhood respiratory illness are known to have an effect on offspring's susceptibility to asthma. If this link exists, we could expect a small but significant association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke during pregnancy and asthma development. Second, maternal and child socioeconomic status are well established to influence the risk of developing asthma. A high-income family might not receive regular prenatal care, or a mother may not have access to care due to health insurance limitations, for example, or poor communication with her doctor about a child's condition. The associations found by the authors are therefore particularly sensitive to such factors. Finally, the study population was predominantly Caucasian. However, many epidemiological studies have shown a relationship between race/ethnicity and asthma (Gottesman et al., 1977; Hsu et al., 1987; Kato et al., 1990; Pertwee & van den Heuvel, 1996), so the findings should be interpreted cautiously.

Q: What does this mean for public health?

A: This study indicates a positive association between household air pollution and childhood asthma. Studies show that when parents report a higher level of air pollution, their children are more susceptible to development of asthma. Thus, while we cannot rule out a causal role for childhood air pollution exposure, the data do not indicate that it causes all cases of adult asthma. More research is needed to determine whether ambient levels of particulate matter are associated with more severe asthma symptoms. Some other important questions still remain. First, how much lower can air quality go if particulates start being inhaled into our lungs instead of breathing them out? Second, what kind of effects on pulmonary function can occur from these smaller particles, even though they tend to be larger in size compared to the oxygen carried by hemoglobin? Third, what effects are seen after long-term exposure to low concentrations of fine particle pollution (PM 2.5 )?

Stage III

Prognosis for patients with stage III disease is poor. Treatment options are limited by the lack of effective treatment options and the high cost of standard therapies. The majority of patients who develop metastases in this group continue to progress and ultimately die from their condition.

Treatment Options

The following treatments can be used as adjuncts to chemotherapy to slow progression. There are currently three drug classes approved for these conditions, known as PD-1 inhibitors.

PD-L1 inhibitor therapy

These drugs bind to a receptor called PPARgammaR, which regulates cellular energy production (such as glucose, fat metabolism). These drugs work by blocking the ability of PGC1α to produce these proteins. In turn, they cause cells to stop producing them. This has been shown to prolong survival by up to 14 months when combined with pembrolizumab (Keytruda), a PD-1 inhibitor that works primarily through PPARalpha activation. Other drugs have also been developed as PD-1 agonists, which allow more than one binding site for the compound to activate.

Other PD-L1 inhibitor therapies include:

Pembrolizumab, Keytruda, Aricept, Tecfidera, Gefitinib and Erenumab

Climactin (Gemzaril), Mevacor (Mevacor) and Trastuzumab

Sirolimus

Ustekinumab (Kineret)

PD-2 inhibitors

PD-2 inhibitors target another gene in the pathway that leads to cell death. They act in two different ways. One acts directly on cancer stem cells and inhibits angiogenesis; the other kills tumor cells that do not make enough PD-1. Some of these compounds block the PD-1 pathway in addition to inhibiting the growth factor receptors on cancer cells. Because there are several PD-2 inhibitors available, they must be combined to achieve full clinical benefit.

Two major groups are taking advantage of the antiangiogenic effects of PD-2 inhibitors to improve outcomes for patients with solid tumors. The first group consists of two companies – Akzo Nobel Pharmaceuticals (Alimta) and Novartis/Biogen Idec (Soliris) – that are developing PD-2 inhibitors that",117,stage 4 metastatic lung cancer outcome,-7.418113231658935,44,q,7,0.1774193548387097,325,4

1. A doctor will check your baby's health just before he gets his first vaccination so he doesn't need extra time to get used to it.

2. Your baby should start getting vaccinated as soon as possible after being born and continue on schedule until age 12 months, when he starts kindergarten. For some children, a second shot at 13-14 months would be needed. But once again, your pediatrician will advise you on what the best course of action is based on how sick your child is and whether the risk from the vaccine outweighs the benefits.

1. Protein intake is more important for achieving good health than any other macronutrient (e.g., fat, carbohydrate) or its ratio (e.g., 0.8).2

2. Animal products are essential in a balanced diet (at least 50% of calories from protein).3

3. Fish are excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids that reduce inflammation, promote healthy skin, heart and brain function and increase energy production.4

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) recommends that Americans eat foods with high dietary fiber levels; select whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, soybeans, nuts, seeds, fish, low-fat dairy, poultry and meat; limit added sugars, processed meats and sweets and minimize saturated fat and trans fats.5

According to the DGA, one serving of seafood contains 18 percent to 23 percent of daily recommended value of EPA+DHA compared to 9 percent to 15 percent of a similar serving of chicken or beef.6

Although the DGA does not specifically recommend specific amounts of animal proteins, it does suggest eating at least 20 grams per day of lean red meat (liver, kidney or brisket), 14 grams per day of poultry and 21 grams per day of eggs.7

Consuming an adequate amount of protein for growth has been shown by both human nutrition studies and laboratory animals to improve muscle mass, strength and balance; prevent bone loss, osteoporosis and cancer; decrease risk of heart disease, stroke and Type 2 diabetes; improve immunity, cognitive performance and mood; control blood sugar; and improve immune function.8

Because high consumption of animal protein increases IGF-I, which in turn stimulates growth hormone release, increased body weight may be experienced over time, especially when protein intake is low.9 In addition, high protein intake may stimulate appetite while reducing satiety, increasing food intake, leading to overeating.10

While animal protein may be beneficial for building muscle mass and improving metabolism, it can also lead to chronic diseases such as obesity, hypertension, heart disease, and some forms of cancer.11 High intakes of animal protein have been linked to higher risks of type 2 diabetes,12 prostate cancer13 and certain types of colon cancer14 among others.15 For these reasons, a variety of plant-based proteins are often used instead of animal proteins in many diets including vegetarian, vegan, lacto-ovo vegetarians, p",96,most efficient and sustainable diets,-9.289199829101562,16,q,7,0.17777777777777778,375,17

B4B.2. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) [see Warnings and Precautions]

Symptoms/signs

Symptoms of CFS may include severe tiredness, low energy, sleep disturbances, weight loss, gastrointestinal problems such as bloating or constipation, cold intolerance, joint pain, muscle aches, arthritis and other symptoms. In many people with CFS, there is no known cause for these conditions and they are likely caused by an immune response that attacks the central nervous system (brain). Common causes of this reaction include infection, injury, trauma, chemotherapy treatments, medications and radiation treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiological treatments, autoimmune disorders, genetics, mental health disorders, viral infections, toxins, brain cancer, head injuries, tumors and organ transplantation.

Signs may appear suddenly or develop slowly over several weeks, months or years. Symptoms do not have to be present at all times. They can also occur without any obvious trigger, for example when having a fever. Many people who suffer from CFS have unexplained illnesses. Although it is rare, some people experience periods where their symptoms disappear completely before gradually becoming more frequent again.

The exact nature of CFS is unknown. The term ""myalgic encephalomyelitis"" describes the disease's symptomology but does not define its underlying pathophysiology. Some researchers think the disease originates with exposure to infectious agents; others believe it results from an immune attack on specific parts of the central nervous system. Scientists are still struggling to identify the mechanisms involved and discover the exact reason why some individuals experience CFS while others do not. It has been suggested that genetic factors play a role in causing CFS, although the precise role of genes is unclear. Other possible triggers could involve environmental factors, nutritional deficiencies or drug reactions. The exact cause of CFS remains unknown.

There is currently no cure for CFS and most of those who get better recover within a few days or weeks. But some people report long lasting recovery after starting treatment for CFS.

Treatment with interferon alpha (IFN-alpha), ribavirin (RV-18), etanercept (Enbrel) or glatiramer acetate (Glatiramer) is recommended if CFS is suspected. Treatment should take place every three to six months. There are several drugs available as",108,chronic diarrhea short-term memory sweating inability to regulate body temperature heart palpitations dysautonomia,-6.325963973999023,9,q,7,0.15254237288135594,368,6

Treatment involves preventing the onset of the disease and controlling its progression\r

and many people will need to take medication for life. For people with \r

diabetes that have an established cure from cancer or HIV/AIDS, their\r

disease is usually controlled by lifestyle modification, diet changes,\r

exercise, and medication. The goal in managing diabetes is a healthy \r

body with normal levels of glucose, insulin, and other hormones. It's possible\r

that some patients may develop side effects in response to medications such as\r

insulin; however, these are typically minor and do not require changing treatment.\r

Diabetes can also be managed using technology like insulin pumps.\r

Numerous studies have been done on various forms of therapy, but there isn\r

not yet enough evidence to say which form of therapy is most effective.\r

There's no proof that any drug or device works for everyone, so the best advice is\r

to discuss your treatment options with your doctor. They'll guide you through\r

The condition was called 'incomplete respiratory failure' and the patient was treated by medical staff on site. They were then transferred to a local hospital where they died from their injuries.

While there is no evidence that a lack of oxygen caused his death it does raise serious questions over why it took so long for paramedics to arrive at his home after the accident.

I am still learning how to live with it. For example, I have a friend who has been diagnosed for many years but not had to stop working. She goes back to work every weekend, and sometimes she even does her job in bed at night because she feels so great. I have found ways to cope, such as going on walks during the day instead of watching TV, reading books, listening to music and playing games with my children.

When I was in school, we were told to go home early if we felt sick. This doesn't really help. When you're busy working you just feel better so you let yourself forget about it.

Q: What are the risks of breast cancer?


The side effects from treating breast cancer depend on the type of cancer.

Women with early stage breast cancer may experience a few temporary problems such as pain during menstruation or headaches, but these problems usually fade within 2 months to 1 year.


However, more serious health issues can occur when women undergo treatment for late stage breast cancer. These include infection (sepsis) and bleeding.


Other side effects may also be experienced by some people who have undergone the same breast cancer treatment. This includes skin changes, liver problems and heart disease. Although it is not known which specific factors cause these side effects, they tend to happen most often in people who had chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. For example, in addition to skin disorders and blood clots, other possible reasons include:

- infections caused by bacteria in the body's immune system;

- tumors that grow more slowly than normal;

- damage to nerves that affects how the brain communicates with muscles (paralysis);

- increased risk of diabetes mellitus.",118,stage 4 triple negative breast cancer treatment,-11.442708969116213,124,q,8,0.5560538116591929,183,11

gpt2-xl_77,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, with signs and symptoms including headache, numbness and weakness on one or both sides of the body, difficulty walking, fatigue, sleep disturbance, cognitive impairment, vision problems, bladder dysfunction, chronic pain and a range of other neurological complaints. The first few years after diagnosis may be very difficult for women as they struggle to cope with these symptoms and the emotional turmoil that can accompany them. During this time, most women's symptoms are subtle and may not present themselves until later in life. As MS progresses, it causes damage to areas around neurons called axons which transmit nerve impulses from neuron to neuron and cause many of the symptoms associated with MS. This is known as neurodegeneration and occurs throughout the brain and spinal cord. Menopause affects the menstrual cycle more than any other aspect of a woman's health. It also leads to changes in blood flow and hormone levels, which can affect the functioning of nerves. Although the exact cause is unknown, there are several theories regarding the link between MS and menopause. One theory is that MS is triggered by an inflammatory response within the immune system against a cell type known as microglia. Microglia contain a protein called CD47, which binds directly to the surface of macrophages — white blood cells. When CD47 is bound to the surface of a lymphocyte, the cell produces chemicals called cytokines, which help destroy invading pathogens. Studies have shown that when the number of CD47-bound microglia increases during MS, inflammation becomes more severe. Many researchers believe this could explain why MS attacks nerve cells. In addition, another hypothesis suggests that inflammation might play a role in causing menopause because the immune system responds less strongly to estrogen and progesterone. Another possible explanation is that MS has something to do with the release of an enzyme called cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), which allows your body to break down endocannabinoids, an active ingredient in marijuana that makes you feel high. COX2 appears to be activated in MS patients at lower doses of THC compared to healthy individuals. However, some studies suggest that smoking cannabis is linked to lower rates of MS. Although these hypotheses have yet to be proven through controlled clinical trials, they are worth investigating further because the findings could potentially lead to new treatments and even new ways to prevent MS.

1. What does the term'social insurance' mean? Social security is an insurance program for social welfare purposes that was established by the government as early as the Qing dynasty (1644-1911). It has been implemented since then under different names like civil service pension scheme, military service pension, agricultural workers benefit, public employees benefits, disaster relief plan, etc. A national health insurance scheme that covers all citizens aged 18 years and older, including individuals with disabilities; provides treatment for non-economic ailments which includes but is not limited to mental illness, cancer, heart attack, stroke, paralysis and other serious illnesses, and pays medical bills; and provide financial assistance to people who need it, such as old age assistance, maternity leave, unemployment compensation, education subsidy, disability allowance, family planning funds, and so forth, has been implemented through various programs over the past decades. These programs have resulted in rapid economic growth. They have also contributed significantly towards improving social harmony, and have helped improve China's standard of living and quality of life. In recent years, though, many citizens have complained about excessive expenses and lack of adequate services provided by social welfare agencies. As a result of these complaints, the government introduced a number of measures aimed at ensuring universal coverage. Some examples of these measures are the expansion of coverage, strengthening of the basic coverage structure, setting up of new insurance products and restructuring of existing ones. Also, a reform of the administrative personnel within these departments has recently taken place, creating opportunities to recruit talented personnel and ensure improved efficiency in handling operations.

Examples include extractions (removal of part of the dentin), root canal surgery, crowns/cones, fillings (procedures that form or seal in your mouth) and other procedures that remove all of the hard tissue inside the tooth structure. c) Gum disease (periodontal): periodontal diseases are caused by bacteria which build up on or around the gum tissues causing inflammation, bleeding and infection. Periodontal disease can cause serious damage to your gums. The only treatment of this condition is keeping your gums clean and healthy and using an antiseptic mouthwash regularly. d) infection (gum abscess): infection is a bacterial infection of your gums. Infection may be caused by a virus or bacteria but most commonly it's a yeast overgrowth, often due to poor hygiene. Symptoms can include redness and swelling at the site of the infection, pain when chewing or swallowing food and loss of saliva.

Although the exact mechanism behind this effect isn't well understood, research suggests that it has to do with insulin resistance and increased lipolysis, which leads to decreased production of fatty acids (i.e. adipose tissue) from fat cells. This decrease in lipid synthesis and storage also reduces the amount of triglycerides that are stored in peripheral tissues as well. It may also be the case that by increasing glucose disposal in muscle, the beta-oxidation process occurs more effectively and efficiently, leading to less oxidative stress on the liver or skeletal muscles.[4]

2. When you're doing these, make sure to stand up straight. If you lean forward or keep your neck bent, your shoulder blades will push the front of your rib cage against the wall and prevent it from coming down into the lift (because your head is still in the air). This makes it difficult to get to full extension (and also puts too much stress on the lower back). Instead, try lifting the entire weight off of your hands while keeping your shoulders stationary. As a result, when you land, your body should be perfectly vertical – like if you were to do a front squat. You'll have the same amount of room to bend your knees as you would in a normal lift.

3. There are some specific exercises that help strengthen these muscles:

Posterior chain exercise: this involves twisting your spine around as far as possible while pushing your ribs out at the top of each rep. For example, if you're holding dumbbells and are performing an exercise known as a ""scapular depression"" where you hold them vertically with your arms extended straight and then twist and squeeze them together, try trying this instead. It's hard but can be effective.

Anterior chain exercise: perform a curl. Pull the bar away from your chest until your chin touches your waistband, and then begin to raise the bar overhead while simultaneously pulling the dumbbells towards your chest, starting just above your chest. Keep squeezing your upper traps and your scapulae as you go up and down. This activates the posterior chain – which is responsible for stabilizing the spine and reducing intra-abdominal pressure.

4. Also, try performing these exercises after working out your abs. Your abdominals don't need a ton of work, but they can definitely benefit from having a strong core. They're very important for controlling blood flow throughout your entire body, and many people believe that their abdominal strength plays a significant role in preventing injuries.

Treatment of psoriasis by using topical steroids

Psoriasis is treated with systemic corticosteroids. The aim of steroid treatment is to reduce inflammation and decrease the number and severity of flares which can be seen on skin biopsy or at periodic visits to the dermatologist for evaluation of the condition. These treatments should not result in a permanent reduction of symptoms but may improve the overall state of your skin.

Steroid treatment consists of the use of drugs that stimulate the body's immune system to destroy certain bacteria and fungi responsible for psoriasis and other conditions such as eczema. Steroids are used mainly to treat severe cases of psoriasis. Some people find it difficult to tolerate some of these treatments. It is important to discuss any concerns you have about taking an antihistamine before starting steroid medication. You will need to tell your doctor if you have allergies to aspirin or any other drugs, so they know whether the steroid should be avoided altogether during treatment. In addition, you will also need to inform them if you have high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, liver disease, or kidney problems. Your doctor or pharmacist will be able to advise you about this.

Topical steroid therapy is usually started one week before the next scheduled visit to your dermatologist. To prevent side effects caused by previous steroid exposure, your skin care professional may start you off slowly rather than abruptly. This allows your skin to get used to its new regimen.

To be effective, steroid injections into the skin are administered either subcutaneously, where the injection site lies under the skin, or intramuscularly, where the needle pierces the outermost layer of the dermis. Most topical medicines have a similar dose to be given subcutaneously. If you prefer an injection, then please refer to the specific product information provided with each medicine.

The most common steroid available over the counter or prescription is prednisone (Duroclofenac). Prednisone is a synthetic version of a naturally occurring protein, called human epidermal growth factor (HERF), which stimulates the growth of new cells in the skin and can help fight infection. This type of steroid has been shown to be more potent than natural HERF in stimulating skin cell growth in people with psoriasis who already have active lesions.

gpt2-xl_94,"The symptoms of MS can take months or years before you experience improvement. Your doctor can help determine when to expect full recovery by discussing the types and severity of your symptoms, their duration, and whether they are improving with treatment (see ""How can my doctor predict how well my MS is progressing?""). It may be necessary for you to stay in an MS-related care facility as long as a year or two after the initial diagnosis if you have ongoing problems or complications (for example, weakness on one side of the body that does not respond to medication, persistent neurological symptoms such as numbness or tingling in your arms and legs).

Q: What's involved in treating multiple sclerosis?\nA: A combination of medicines called interferon, glatiramer acetate and/or methylprednisolone is used to treat MS. These medications affect the immune system and can cause serious side effects. If you've been treated recently with these medications and still have signs and symptoms of MS, it's important for you to tell your doctor about any new symptoms. Your doctor will try to adjust the medications to avoid causing further damage and help minimize any other potential causes of your symptoms.

Q: Do all people who have MS need this type of medicine?\nA: All people diagnosed with MS should get preventive treatment. This means taking medicine to protect against the development of MS. For some people, this means vitamin E supplements or taking immunoglobulin. In most cases, however, preventive treatments include taking interferon (finasteride) and other drugs called biologics. Biologics suppress the production of certain proteins which can trigger the development of MS. Certain blood tests also can be done to check for early signs of MS, including brain lesions, vision changes or hearing loss.

gpt2-xl_63,"I believe it will. With the current prevalence of MS, one can easily see how a person's ability to perform in their professional life may be affected, as well as their social and emotional life. However, this is not necessarily a bad thing; many people with Multiple Sclerosis find that they are able to function quite well outside work or school. Many other professionals have been affected by MS, such as doctors, dentists, engineers, and business owners. These individuals have found ways to take advantage of their disability and maintain their careers despite limitations.

Some employers have policies in place for employees who have disabilities. If your employer does not provide such coverage, you might be able to purchase insurance on your own. You may also want to consider taking a job at a medical center. These centers specialize in assisting patients from all walks of life throughout their treatment. For example, some facilities treat children with neurodevelopmental disorders, providing them with specialized services, including occupational therapy and speech therapy. These programs are very beneficial to people with MS and help to build confidence and self-esteem. A good physician can often make such assessments and refer patients to these types of program. Also, in the case of an employee whose employment contract includes benefits like health care, it may be possible to negotiate a benefit package with the hospital where you work. It should be noted that some hospitals do offer disability insurance and/or retiree health plans which include such benefits. The key is knowing your rights and responsibilities regarding workplace conditions.

Q: What is the outlook for MS?\nA: There is no known cure for MS, but there are effective treatments available today and a variety of therapies being developed over time. Although the disease is difficult to manage, early intervention can significantly reduce its severity. In fact, studies show that up to 75% of patients can control the onset of symptoms after starting treatment within six months. The only serious long term consequences associated with MS are pain, numbness, muscle weakness, loss of vision, and cognitive impairment. Other effects, such as headaches, fatigue, and sleep disturbances occur more frequently than those related to diabetes and hypertension, making any of these symptoms a significant concern if they become severe enough. Therefore, it is essential that patients understand what to expect and plan accordingly. The most important thing is to make sure that they know their diagnosis so that they know how to protect themselves and others around them during the course of their illness.

The patient is a 44 year old woman who presented with an exacerbation of her MS symptoms in the past week. She was diagnosed with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) after 1 year and has had no recurrence since then, even during an episode of acute phase relapse that lasted 3 days. \r

She started taking lamotrigine 2 weeks prior to presentation and reported significant improvement in her clinical symptoms. After stopping her medication for 6 months, she did not regain the previous level of function until 3 years later when she returned to MS clinic where she underwent serial MRI scans. The median time between treatment initiation and final scan was 10 months. At the end of follow up, she had no evidence of neurological deficits or neurodegenerative disease. Her MS index score improved from 27 to 21 at the beginning of therapy, and thereafter it steadily decreased over time. In addition, she showed improvements on verbal memory, attention and social cognition tests. There were no side effects noted. \r

[...] The patient also exhibited a decrease in carpal tunnel syndrome that occurred despite continued treatment with lamotrigine. This may be due to the fact that her lesions appeared as mononuclear infiltrates on MR imaging.

gpt2-xl_54,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition affecting the central nervous system. It affects about one in eight adults worldwide and about 400,000 Americans. The disease typically begins during childhood or adolescence and tends to strike younger individuals than those who have other diseases. It causes the death of nerve cells that control muscle movement, sensation, vision, and hearing. MS also affects women more often than men, and those with less severe symptoms tend not to seek treatment as aggressively. While many forms of MS affect similar areas on the brain, the most common form has affected around 50 million people worldwide over the past 30 years and is estimated to affect one-third of all U.S. patients between the ages of 40 and 60, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In this disease, the immune system attacks and destroys myelin sheaths — protective fatty tissue covering axons in neurons (nerve fibers). Myelination helps enable nerves to send messages through their circuits; without myelination, signals cannot be transmitted properly. By removing damaged myelin, MS destroys communication channels and sends the message ""we don't need you anymore."" Without myelinated tracts, the part of the spinal cord where muscles, sensory nerves, and the brain are located can no longer transmit information to the rest of the body. Thus, there is loss of strength and mobility of vital organs. For example, muscle weakness may result from difficulty breathing because of a lack of oxygen to the brain. These symptoms can become debilitating and even life threatening. Some research suggests that MS could someday develop into a progressive disorder. However, for now, the best way to manage symptoms is by taking medication called an anticoagulant, which lowers the level of blood clots in the arteries that supply the heart. This reduces blood pressure and improves circulation. Other medications, including antihistamines (drugs to treat allergic reactions), anti-seizure drugs (drugs used to prevent seizures when they occur), and steroids, target inflammation. Together these medications help regulate cell function, reduce pain, and protect the body's own tissues from damage. Although some symptoms of MS can improve after treatment, others never go away. That means MS affects a person's daily ability to perform everyday tasks such as walking, climbing stairs, talking, eating, bathing, dressing, etc. Many people with MS suffer extreme fatigue, headaches, depression, confusion, memory problems, trouble concentrating, sleep disturbances, abnormal bowel movements, nausea, dizziness, tremors, tingling sensations",54,What does multiple sclerosis diagnosis include?

1- A child's natural immune system will be stronger than an adult's. The young child cannot develop allergies to food or medication like adults do because their bodies have not had the chance to develop antibodies against these substances yet. Therefore, any illness that occurs in children is usually caused by a reaction in the body to foreign substances such as bacteria, viruses or fungi instead of a disease being caused by an actual virus. This also applies to illnesses which are more likely to occur in babies and toddlers (such as ear infections, eczema and sinusitis).


2- In case you're concerned about a vaccine injury, consider that the average age at which a baby becomes immunized for measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, chicken pox and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) has increased from 6 months to 14 years old since 1988.


3- Children who get too much vitamin A during early childhood may become hyperactive, have poor concentration, irritability, trouble sleeping, lose weight and even grow large heads. Vitamin D deficiency in infants can lead to a condition called rickets. Adults must take supplements to maintain adequate levels of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and other essential minerals and vitamins. People with low stomach acid or a weak immune system should avoid certain foods such as egg yolk, fish and shellfish, milk products and dairy products. If they are sick with fever, coughs, shortness of breath, sore throat and muscle aches, they should eat plenty of fluids, salt and fruit juices. If there is no obvious cause of their symptoms, the first thing to do is contact your doctor or local health department, especially if symptoms begin within 1 hour of eating or drinking something bad.

3. What is the clinical course?


a) First episode : episodes typically occur in adolescence or young adulthood, usually with onset before age 18. The majority of patients are socially withdrawn, introverted and have a poor sense of self-worth; they may be prone to being impulsive and engaging in risky behaviors (eg, substance abuse). They experience profound dysphoria, depressed mood and an overall feeling that life has no meaning. Bipolar I disorder is characterized by at least one manic episode occurring twice per year for 3 months, followed by a hypomanic episode lasting 2–6 weeks. Patients can have psychotic features, including hallucinations, delusions and/or paranoia. b) Second episode : some bipolar I patients continue their illness up to midlife. Others experience remission during middle years. In the past two decades, many patients treated for bipolar I disorder with lithium therapy experienced a second major episode. c) Third episode: most patients with bipolar I disorder relapse as adults. However, about 5% of patients do not complete a full recovery and become chronic relapsers. These individuals commonly suffer from depression and other mental health disorders, which include substance use disorders. d) Persisting disability due to mood instability: approximately half of patients will eventually develop severe psychiatric morbidity such as depressive episodes and suicidal ideation. Some studies have found that those whose first episode was a partial response, and who subsequently enter a new phase of disease, are less likely to die prematurely than those without a history of mania or subthreshold episodes. e) Recurrence after hospital discharge : up to 30% of bipolar I patients experience another episode within 6 months of leaving hospital. f) Long-term sequelae : many people with bipolar disorder live with residual depressive symptoms for their entire lives. g) Cognitive deficits : mood swings disrupt cognitive functioning (ie, thinking processes), increasing risk for impaired educational performance, career failure and interpersonal difficulties. h) Risk factors for suicide: current or previous suicide attempts or self-harm or unstable relationships. i) Risk factors for bipolar II disorder: having had any lifetime major depressive episode, family histories of bipolar disorder, multiple personality disorder, conduct disorder, or schizophrenia. j) Other psychiatric comorbidities: substance dependence or substance misuse, obsessive comp",114,borderline personality disorder symptoms,-12.27759838104248,94,q,8,0.8703703703703703,390,6

Q: What are the other benefits of the drug?

A: The most notable benefit is that there appears to be a reduction in nerve cell loss with the use of CSL-2. There was also some improvement in clinical progression. For people who have relapsed after treatment with corticosteroids or other disease modifying therapies, this may help them avoid a relapse and allow for more time for recovery. This kind of therapy can often provide a better outcome than what would otherwise occur if an individual took these drugs on their own. However, because it has not been studied as well as other treatments for MS, we do not know how long they will last in the body.

Q: I am in a long term relationship (3 years) with someone who is not my husband. We have been together about 9 months. We were both married once before and ended up divorced. After we broke up, he stayed around for 6 months after we separated. During those six months, he started showing symptoms of being addicted to porn. Our relationship was already rocky at best during that time. I didn't want him around because I wasn't comfortable around him in general. When it came to our relationship again, I felt like I should let go of any feelings of animosity toward him because he'd obviously turned his life around for the better by staying in the marriage. However, the more I thought about what he did and how much worse it could become if he continued down this path, the less I wanted him around me. This week, he told me that he needed to quit watching porn and he told me why – he found himself doing it again and it was making him feel good so he decided to stop. Is that cheating? Should I tell him I'm worried because he might be tempted to cheat again? I guess we'll find out soon enough.

A: To answer your questions first off, ""cheating"" can mean many different things in different situations and circumstances. One person may say they're not sure how much their spouse enjoys sex -- that's cheating. Another could say they're only happy when their spouse gets naked and that's adultery. For Sara, her husband was using porn. That doesn't look like the kind of behavior that will change, no matter how much it makes her feel like quitting porn is the right thing to do.

gpt2-xl_55,"There are no specific ""disease-management"" protocols for MS; however, lifestyle changes and medication can help people live more fully with the disease. People who have MS should try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise most days, especially early in the day and after meals when the circulation is slowest. This will benefit their circulatory system and other organs as well. In addition, they should avoid heavy alcohol use and tobacco use, which increase the risk of developing MS.

A person may be diagnosed with MS only if there is a positive test result for an abnormal immune response called autoimmunity (see below). The initial screening tests used by doctors include:

The results of these tests come back quickly. It usually takes about 2 weeks from diagnosis to confirm that it's MS. If you have had symptoms or signs of MS before you were first tested and have recently been diagnosed, see your doctor again. Also call your doctor right away if you develop new problems such as weakness, pain or numbness in your arms or legs. These could mean you have another condition. You may need more tests.

How do I know if my body has the ""autoimmune"" reaction to my own proteins?

Doctors don't understand exactly what causes this reaction, but scientists believe they might involve a protein called interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) released by white blood cells in the body. IL1B has many different functions, including helping our bodies fight infection, fighting cancer, protecting against infections that can cause severe damage, and keeping inflammation under control. Scientists now think that some people with MS react to their own proteins because their immune systems attack them, creating inflammation. For example, scientists believe that IL1B plays a role in causing arthritis in some people with MS. However, some studies suggest that having high levels of IL1B doesn't necessarily lead to MS. Doctors aren't sure why some people don't react to their own proteins and others do. Some experts think that this type of autoimmune reaction occurs less often than people realize because most people with MS experience only short periods of severe illness during their lives.

Some research suggests that children and young adults with MS have a higher chance of developing MS as adolescents or young adulthood than children without MS. Scientists also think that older people who develop MS may have a greater risk of developing chronic illnesses later in life because their bodies are weakened, making them more vulnerable to infections and viruses. Other researchers suspect that the underlying cause of MS may change over",55,How to manage multiple sclerosis?,-0.0559801161289215,7,q,8,0.028455284552845527,430,8

Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) are not unique to any given vehicle and may be obtained from various sources, including manufacturer's websites. For example, I purchased my '94 Toyota Corolla with a VIN #1B040162 from an independent dealer in New York City.


The most common way to obtain a VIN number is by purchasing a used vehicle. A dealer will often issue one if it is found that the previous owner has a damaged VIN. However, the number does not guarantee a genuine Toyota. Many dealers will only accept a VIN as proof of ownership and cannot sell you a new one unless you purchase them on their behalf. If you wish to buy a vehicle from a dealership, take the following steps to ensure that you get the correct one:


Ask what is ""the problem"" with your car. Ask whether they know how much mileage the previous owners had.

Check the odometer reading. Most dealerships offer this service free of charge.


After you've determined which model the dealership sold you, talk to other dealers who dealt with them to confirm that the same problem was present at each location. You may need to search local classified ads looking for similar cars that have been reported stolen.

TEMPERATURE EFFECTS OF PHENYLACETATE ON THE BIOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF HUMAN BLOOD, MUTAGENICITY AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIOUS DISEASE (STID) JOCELYN DICKINSON & VIVIAN GARCIA-MILES, PhD [published online October 2016] *

Abstract

Background: Phospholipids are important cellular components, and their composition is affected by temperature.

Objectives: To determine the effect of heat treatment on the biological properties of human serum albumin, phthalate metabolites (PGD2 and PPD), and phytoestrogens (phytohormone).

Methods: In vitro experiments were performed with human serum albumin; human PGD2 metabolite; and phytoestrogen, to evaluate the effects of heat treatment. The results demonstrated that all compounds reacted more strongly at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. Serum PGF 2α, PGE 2, TGF alpha 1/2, IL 8, CRP, IL6, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) increased as compared with control values at 24 °C, 28 °C, 33 °C and 38 °C but decreased when tested at 41 °C.

Results: In vitro incubations using whole blood or serum albumin resulted in inhibition of proteinase K degradation, phosphorylation of tyrosine residues and increased glutathione peroxidase activity. Serum concentrations of pyrrolidine alkaloids, dihydrotestosterone and dihydrotestosterone sulfates, and glucocorticoid receptor antagonists increased as well. No significant changes were observed in other enzyme activities, including amino acid metabolism, calcium and iron absorption, and cholesterol synthesis. No differences were found between treatments in any of these parameters. All tests showed that treatment with PGF 2 α caused inhibition of proteinase K activity, whereas treatment with PPD prevented this inhibition. In contrast to serum albumin, which was not altered by temperature, liver microsomes from treated rats showed an increase in hydroxyl radical production during heating, and this increase correlated with increases in plasma levels of 3-aminoquinone.

B: Do you have any other health concerns?

A: My sleep apnea is a real concern. The best thing would be to take some medication that will reduce your breathing rate and keep me from collapsing in bed. But I've had good success with taking two medications at once. They can help me stay awake when I need it most.


Q: what is your current weight or height?

A: 55 years old, 5'2"" tall, 120 lbs

Q: Why do you exercise?

A: To maintain my health. To feel better after having a stressful day. A long walk or run helps me relax. And since losing weight has been so challenging, I enjoy working out on an empty stomach because then I get an extra boost of energy to make it through another day.


Q: What are your typical meals/snacks?

A: Some days, eggs, cheese, crackers, chicken thighs and/or tuna salad; other days fish, salads and vegetables; sometimes pizza, pasta and steak.

I also like to eat whole grain breads and cereals before and between workouts.


Q: How often do you go to the gym?

A: Sometimes 3-4 times per week, usually more if I'm feeling particularly motivated.

Q: What causes multiple sclerosis? A: Multiple sclerosis is a disease characterized by the body's inability to properly repair and maintain its own tissues. This leads to damage to nerves in your brain, spinal cord, and elsewhere in the body. Q: How do I know if I have MS? A: It depends on how you define it. ""MS"" refers to any of several types of inflammatory demyelinating diseases (ISDs), including relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and secondary progressive MS. However, there isn't one definition for all people with MS; they may be diagnosed based on an MRI or other diagnostic technique. Most people with MS experience at least some of these symptoms: fatigue

dizziness or lightheadedness

restlessness

headache

mild weakness

muscle pain

sore throat or sore gums

slight loss of coordination, balance, muscle tone, or reflexes

loss of bladder control or bowel function

problems speaking

difficulty swallowing

changes in vision

blurred vision

a change in sense of smell

unusual sweating or skin color (usually paler than usual)

lack of sleep The list above only includes some examples of many possible signs and symptoms that can occur as part of MS, so ask about yours. If you feel like you've experienced any of the above signs and symptoms while living with MS, discuss them with your health care provider. It's important to note that you should never stop taking medication because of a single symptom. Your doctor will need to assess whether medications you're taking are helping you manage your symptoms. If you continue to experience worsening symptoms after your current treatment has been exhausted, talk to your healthcare provider about switching to another type of therapy.

Treatment options for multiple sclerosis Treatment options for MS range from drug therapies to lifestyle changes such as exercise or nutrition. Some drugs used to treat MS can also help improve symptoms in those who don't have MS but who might benefit from them. For example, oral steroids may reduce inflammation, numbness, tingling, spasms, and stiffness associated with MS. They may also increase mobility in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Antibiotics and immune system boosting medicines are often prescribed as well. These treatments affect immune cells that play a role in causing MS. Antibiotic drugs may help prevent infection when treating patients",68,List of multiple sclerosis symptoms,-0.1825517416000366,2,q,8,0.00904977375565611,384,23

MS is divided into two main phases of activity: acute (also called relapsing-remitting) and chronic (also called progressive). The first stage can last from 3 to 12 months for most people. Symptoms are usually mild and improving over that time. As part of the course of MS, many times patients experience periods of remission where their disability disappears completely. However, some people will have persistent symptom flare ups lasting 6-12 months before they return to full health.

Q: Is there a good clinical trial to prove that the natural treatment of MS is curative?

A: Yes, there is a randomized placebo-controlled study (RCT) called Efficacy and Safety of Cytokine Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis, which was approved by the FDA in 2008. There have been only two published studies on the benefits of the anti-inflammatory cytokines in humans (Cytokinetics in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis: A Randomized Controlled Trial and Cytokines for CNS Toxicity in Patients with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis). The results from these two studies were positive and demonstrated that the administration of IL12 and IL8 for 6 months reduced the number of relapses as well as improved the quality of life in patients with relapsing MS. More recently, an RCT has shown that IL6, IL18, and IL10 can decrease brain inflammation associated with Alzheimer's Disease. These findings are exciting and suggest that this type of treatment could be beneficial for other neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, several small trials have found that the injections of IL20 reduce symptoms and slow disease progression. However, more research is needed before any long term data can be presented.

Q: Why aren't we seeing enough MS patient participation in clinical trials?

A: Because it is very hard to get funding to conduct a major medical trial like this. Currently, there are approximately 3 million people living with MS in the United States alone. Most individuals who do participate in clinical trials receive either a grant or a stipend. While we believe that everyone should have access to care through insurance, many patients cannot afford these costs so they often choose not to participate. As such, if you don't qualify for coverage through your employer, you may still be able to take advantage of private insurance and/or Medicaid to help pay for your care. In addition, in some states, health plans may also cover the cost of therapy but must charge additional amounts depending on what medication and procedure is used. For example, if you use a laser for hair loss, then the laser company will likely bill you at a higher rate than if you simply go to the pharmacy and pick up the medicine yourself. Another option is to enroll in Medicare Part D which provides subsidized drug coverage for those 65 years old or older (see below), or a private plan. Finally, you may still be eligible for free screening tests via www.medicare.gov/",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-4.730791091918945,63,q,8,0.47368421052631576,406,6
gpt2-xl_93,"Yes. Sleep disorders are common among individuals with MS, and the symptoms of sleep deprivation can mimic those experienced by patients who have developed multiple sclerosis (MS). It is estimated that approximately half of all people over age 50 who have MS will experience some form of sleep disturbance. Although there is no consensus on a definitive diagnosis, several factors suggest the possibility of MS-related insomnia or similar syndromes in patients with MS. The following are commonly reported symptoms of sleep disorders in persons with MS.

1) Lack of REM sleep (REM-sleep paralysis)

2) Sleep apnea

3) Delayed wakefulness (e.g., sleepwalking, poor memory recall, impaired judgment)

4) Insomnia (a lack of adequate restful sleep)

5) Cognitive deficits (i.e., cognitive disorganization, confusion, impaired attention/concentration, emotional outbursts)

NAPLAN testing


The NAPLAN (National Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey) was used to assess sleep disturbance, fatigue and cognitive function among 982 adults aged 18 years or more living in Australia with an active MS diagnosis. The survey also assessed comorbid conditions such as depression, anxiety, alcohol and substance abuse, other neurological disorders, and diabetes mellitus type 2, in addition to lifestyle factors such as smoking status, physical activity level and diet habits. In total, 39% of participants had at least one impairment related to their sleep disorder, with 13% reporting multiple impairments.

SLEEP DISORDER AND AUTISM IN AUSTRALIA

Sleep disturbance has been found to be associated with increasing risk for development of MS in both young and older adults.

Young adult adults with a history of recurrent or persistent difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep were nearly twice as likely as healthy controls to have elevated levels of CSPV and increased sleep onset latency time. Those with MS had significantly higher prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease compared to controls.

gpt2-xl_72,"Yes, the vaccine is safe. However, many people (especially people on multiple sclerosis medications) are at increased risk of side effects from this vaccine because they take a lot of these medicines. If you have a high dose of any medicine that contains vitamin A or carotenoids (e.g., retinoids and beta blockers), talk to your doctor about whether there's a lower dose that won't harm you (but be sure to tell him or her if you already take such a medication). Also talk with your doctor before starting any new medications that contain vitamin A or carotenoids.

Q: How should I store my flu shot?\nA: Flu shots can remain in their original carton in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks, after which time they must be refrigerated. They also can be stored at room temperature or under a frozen drawer. The flu shot should not be kept in the freezer because it will lose potency over time. This vaccine protects against all three strains of influenza virus, but the best protection comes from one type—the H3N2 strain. It is possible to get the same level of protection by getting two flu vaccines—one with one type of virus and one with another type. You'll need two doses of each vaccine.

If you do keep the vaccine in its original carton, it should be handled carefully so as to avoid injury. Keep it out of direct sunlight. Avoid touching your eyes when the needle is inserted into the body (you may feel some mild pain). If you have an open cut, wash the area immediately with soap and water. Do not rub the vaccine into the skin around the injection site. After injecting the vaccine, shake off any excess fluid and dispose of the unused portion securely into a sealed container.",72,Is the Covid-19 vaccine safe for people taking multiple sclerosis drugs?,-0.0651017874479293,35,q,8,0.1643192488262911,300,28
gpt2-xl_79,"Yes, you can. There is a 1-in-2 chance that if you have MS and an affected child, the parent of the child has MS as well. However, there are some complications for this, such as when the siblings have different patterns or types of MS (for example, if one sibling has relapsing forms of MS while the other sibling does not). Also, it may be difficult to establish who has which form of MS so it would be best to consult with your doctor to determine whether passing the disease on to another relative would be wise.

Q: What should I do if my relative refuses therapy?


A: If treatment is being refused, contact the physician directly. Do not ask others in your family to refuse treatment. Many people will try to convince their relatives to accept the diagnosis and treatments offered by the doctors at the clinic. This rarely works. The only way to end the confusion over what is happening is through honest communication between the patient and physicians, which is often difficult to achieve because of differences of opinion about what is going on.

In addition, please remember that when discussing treatment options, even with close friends, the doctor has his/her own opinions about what is best for your loved one. Please keep those opinions confidential unless you want your friend to know them.

Q: Why do some women develop symptoms after having children?


A: It is possible that some women, particularly older mothers, have low levels of sex hormones in their body from having had babies earlier in life, causing changes in the lining of their uterus. This may cause problems during pregnancy and possibly even after childbirth. These include inflammation and damage to the walls of the uterus, which can lead to pain and bleeding. Some experts believe that it is also possible that there is more than one hormone involved in these conditions.


If your doctor suspects that you might be pregnant, she will check your blood pressure every 6 months and monitor your progress toward delivery. She may need to perform ultrasound scans before and during the birth process to identify any abnormalities in the baby's development. During labor, the doctor will also examine the mother's abdomen and cervix periodically, including at the time of vaginal exams. You will probably notice a change in your pelvic floor muscles as your water breaks -- this will help her understand how much force she needs to apply during labor.


Your doctor also recommends that you avoid strenuous exercise for several weeks after giving birth, and take antacids for up to three days after labor",79,Can I pass multiple sclerosis to other family members?,-0.0104068713262677,0,q,8,0.0,439,20

S. M.: results are reported in terms of percent changes from baseline (ie, baseline PSA level=0). Data are adjusted for age, race/ethnicity and other risk factors such as smoking history, family history of colorectal or ovarian cancer, body mass index, education, alcohol intake, physical activity and hormone use at baseline, menopausal status, diabetes mellitus and estrogen replacement therapy at baseline. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC) except where otherwise stated. In addition to the study-specific variables, we used a composite variable that included all variables that showed an association with total PSA response, including PSA dose, duration of testosterone use, number of years since start of testosterone treatment, and menopausal status. To investigate whether the observed differences between groups could be attributed to the fact that there was no difference between men taking testosterone alone and those who took both testosterone and DHT, we performed analyses separately on subgroups defined by length of time taken to achieve testosterone levels above 5 ng/dl (<1 yr), frequency of first oral doses (>5 times per week), and dosage at which initial serum concentrations of DHT were below 10 pmol/L (<20% of men). For each combination of these characteristics considered, we computed the median change from baseline in each group compared to the mean change among controls. Statistical significance was set at α = 0.05. The same analysis was also performed on women without a family history of breast or prostate cancers.

Results We enrolled 394 subjects from the National Cancer Institute–sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial. Of this population, 240 had received placebo, and 40 had received testosterone enanthate.

During the first year after randomization, 81% (102/103) of the treatment group experienced statistically significant decreases in PSA, whereas only 49% (57/104) of the placebo group experienced increases (P <.001).

gpt2-xl_113,"The question was, how do I deal with the respiratory symptoms from hay fever. A: All over. We have been through it a thousand times. And we will get to this in a minute. Q: What about hay fever itself? A: It is an infection of your lungs and your airways. When you breathe out, that's what's causing all these allergies. They are caused by pollen or mold or something else. This is also where the inhalers come in, because if you put them on top of it you can help calm down some of the airway problems.

The other important thing here to understand is that both men who are allergic to hayfever as well as those who have been exposed to hay fever as children, develop severe asthma. But there is no cure for either one. Both groups need to take medication which includes steroid therapy (if they choose) and antihistamines.

Some studies show that people who are allergic to hay fever have more symptoms than those who aren't, which makes sense when you think about the fact that you don't want to be breathing the same stuff every day. So most patients take allergy medications like Prednisone. However, a few people who are not allergic to hay fever take a different approach; they start their own supplement program instead.

Dr. John O'Connor has done research with patients who began taking the antihistamine Zyrtec in order to reduce their allergies and asthma attacks. These people reported that their condition improved significantly, compared to when they were using prednisone. Other researchers have found similar results with other treatments such as probiotics, enzymes and vitamins.

So it may sound crazy, but Dr. O'Connor says he has had two cases where his patients started out allergic to hay fever, developed hay fever symptoms after switching to a supplement regimen and then successfully reduced their health issues. For example, one patient took prednisone for 10 years and then switched to a low-allergy diet (the person lives near Boston), used topical steroids to treat the hay fever and continued to use prednisone for many years afterwards. This led him to believe that prednisone could actually cause more harm than good. He went back to treating the underlying problem with the right treatment.

What about the patients who cannot tolerate prednisone at all? How do they overcome their allergic reactions without any drugs?

In this large study, we describe what is likely the largest series of observations ever done on mortality and survival following single doses of ionizing radiation therapy. We have obtained results consistent with previous studies in which patients had more than five sessions of irradiation.2,3 In contrast, our data provide evidence that the magnitude of benefit increases with increasing exposures.

Q: my neck hurts?A: this is usually a result of the cervical vertebrae not being in correct alignment. It's normal and will go away on its own. Your doctor may recommend X-rays to make sure it has fully healed.


Q: what is the best way to tell if I have an enlarged lymph node?A: the best way is when you can feel something sticking out of your body. The next time you have pain or numbness in one or both arms, legs, hands, feet or face (or anything else), you probably have an enlargement. If the sore, tender, painful area does not heal within 24 hours, see a doctor.


Q: what happens if I keep getting these types of pains?A: You must take extra care with anything that causes your muscles to tighten up. Try stretching more, do some deep breathing exercises, and drink lots of water. Have a friend massage you while you sleep so you don't get tired.


Q: Can I use cortisone during treatment?A: yes, but only for the first couple weeks after surgery. After two weeks, most patients experience relief from their symptoms. However, it must be used sparingly because it may leave you sterile due to immune system suppression.


Q: How long should I stay off steroids?A: Most people need no special attention. Just follow the instructions and you'll be fine. This includes steroids and hormones like estrogen and progesterone.


Q: Is there a catch to this surgery?A: No. There aren't any side effects other than inflammation.


Q: What happens to the rest of the lymphatic system once the cancer is gone?A: You might notice some mild fever that resolves on its own. The rest of your lymph nodes will still grow even after surgery, so keep an eye on them to ensure they're healthy. If you feel better quickly, then you might want to wait another week or two before going back on drugs. Remember, your immune system needs time to recover.

Q: What is your diet like?

A: I'm very vegetarian (laughs). It's about 80/20 vegetarianism. That means 20% is meat-based food and 80% is plant-based food. And I try to be mindful enough to know if it's okay to take a bite out of a steak here and there because it's just so good for me. But you know when you're trying to find healthy foods at home, there are no rules whatsoever. If something isn't bad for you, then go ahead and eat it.

Q: How does vegetarianism affect your performance as a quarterback?

A: For me personally, this past year was one where I really didn't care much about anything else. I was focused on being able to function. When you can do that -- physically, mentally, emotionally -- then other stuff doesn't matter. So my mindset changed from 'What am I doing? Should I even be playing?' To 'Okay, I can still play.'

Some of these items may cause a reaction similar to that seen with Tylenol. These include cold and allergy medications; muscle relaxers, sedatives, tranquilizers, sleeping pills, birth control pills, antidepressant drugs, muscle relaxer, antipsychotic drugs, anticonvulsant agents, insulin, calcium channel blockers, and anticoagulants. Also, be sure your doctors know what tests you've had before starting any new medicine.

If you're taking an antidepressant, you'll need to stop it first before starting Tylenol to make sure there won't be unwanted or unexpected changes in your brain chemistry. You might experience withdrawal symptoms if you suddenly take an antidepressant after using Tylenol. If this happens you should call your doctor immediately.

How should I store Tylenol?

Store Tylenol at room temperature between 68°F and 77°F (20°C and 25°C). Keep out of reach of children and pets. Do not keep expired medications on hand. Keep Tylenol and its packaging closed tightly and away from light. Avoid contact with excessive heat, sparks or open flame. Discard unused capsules within 3 months of opening. Discard empty bottles after 2 years of storage.

A person with type 1 or type 2 can never completely eliminate the risk of developing diabetes, and this risk is increased among people who have not been diagnosed with the disease.Diabetes can lead to a number of complications such as kidney problems, heart attack and stroke (although these are generally rare), nerve damage and blindness. Some individuals also suffer from osteoporosis, which can cause bones to become fragile and break easily.Diabetes has affected more than 100 million Americans over the past four decades1. It affects both men and women equally. It's estimated that about 20% of all African-American adults have been diagnosed with diabetes2. This number will increase due to the increasing obesity rates in African-Americans3. In addition, diabetes may affect anyone of any age, race or ethnicity; however, it is likely that the rate of diabetes increases in older people4.

Q: what is the best weight loss pill?\nA: I have not heard of any pills that work well for this problem and I am not willing to give up my beloved Vyvanse yet. I do know it does help with stomach aches though...I've never used it for any other issue and have tried a lot of different things (caffeine, kratom, etc).

Pap smear, vaginal cytology (vaginal fluid), or cervical cytology (cytological smears) may be used to detect noncancerous abnormalities. This includes changes that do not appear on a Pap test.

The most common abnormal findings on cervical cytology are cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, an abnormally shaped gland at the back of the cervix, or adenocarcinoma in situ.

Cervical biopsy is performed when noncancerous cells have been found during routine screening for cancer. A small sample is taken from around the outside of the cervix using an instrument called a speculum and is examined under a microscope. The type of abnormal cell present depends on whether it's cancerous or normal.

A few weeks ago there was an article in the NY Times on ehrling's danlos syndrome but it is not well known so its importance cannot be understated. The article states that this disorder causes the body to produce antibodies against itself causing chronic fatigue syndrome. It also notes that if left untreated, patients can develop diabetes, heart disease and liver dysfunction as they age. However, the most dangerous part of the article is when they write ""Doctors say that they have seen increasing numbers of people with severe cases of EDS who may never get better."" Why would we ever think that that would be true? This is just one example that has been given by Drs. Rabiner and Gershon of Yale.

Q: i've been using tic tac toe since my teenage years. I had 2 episodes of acute TTS (Tonic-Clonus) after I started taking ibuprofen and aspirin. I tried a low dose of acetaminophen and it helped a little bit, but the attacks were still very painful and lasted over a week each time. After a month I stopped using both drugs because it hurt too much, and they didn't help anything either. Recently, the symptoms became worse again and I took two more doses of acetaminophen and 1/2 a bottle of aspirin (all at once). They did not work either. I'm worried it might have something to do with acid reflux (which causes these problems), since I'm a smoker who often sneezes during periods of extreme stress. Do you think this could be a cause for concern? What should I try next?

A: Tics are a normal part of many people's lives. Tics are usually triggered by trauma, sleep disturbances, medications, infections, anxiety, and even physical activity. There are several types of Tics. If your symptoms get worse without stopping them, then you probably have Acute Tics. Your doctor will talk about your specific type of Tic and see whether there is anything he can suggest to help stop the attacks.

gpt2-xl_83,"Because MS is an autoimmune disorder, the immune system attacks the myelin sheath that insulates nerve fibers from injury. That's why relapses are so common in MS patients. It's the same reason doctors diagnose diabetes and heart disease — because they attack the body's own cells that produce its energy source. This kind of damage to the brain or spinal cord leads to symptoms such as pain or numbness (migraine) during certain activities, like walking up stairs or driving.

MS is classified into five different types based on the number and severity of the neurological deficits that result from the auto-immune process. These disorders can be managed with medication but often require ongoing treatment. The main goal of this study was to look at how the drug cyclosporine could help reduce or eliminate the relapses. Previous studies have found some MS drugs work effectively in treating most cases. But few treatments are effective for all cases. If one drug were more than 98 percent effective in relieving symptoms compared to placebo, it would likely be recommended as the first course of treatment for patients. In the trial, which ran from September 2011 through April 2013, the researchers randomly assigned 15 men and women to either cyclosporine or a placebo pill. They then monitored the participants' brains and spinal cords over the next nine months using Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or MRI, scans. After nine months, the patients who took cyclosporine had almost twice as many fewer relapses — 19 versus 13 — compared to those taking a placebo. Cyclosporine was also associated with improvements in four other patient measures: pain, fatigue, sleep problems and depression. ""The results suggest that cyclosporine may be especially beneficial when used in conjunction with other medications,"" says Dr. William H. Pazdernik, lead author of the paper and professor of neurology at Stanford University School of Medicine. The research team plans followup studies at Stanford Medical Center, Kaiser Permanente Northern California Health Care System and at other health care facilities nationwide to see whether the benefits of cyclosporine continue to improve over time. The research team will present the findings Thursday, March 27, 2016, at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting in Chicago.

The term ""not adequate"" refers to any clinical trial that has been found inadequate on at least two different grounds and where one of those grounds was either that it was too expensive or lacked sufficient power, or had insufficient quality control measures, data extraction and analysis. These trials do have to be published in full as well but are not always deemed not adequate. The European Medicines Agency guidelines for assessing the adequacy of clinical trials of new medicines state that a study cannot be judged satisfactory if its primary outcome (the number needed to treat [NNT]) is less than 20% higher than expected.

In addition, a trial can only be concluded that does not meet these standards if it is described as being unblinded or with selective reporting of outcomes. In some cases a small proportion of patients might receive alternative treatments or may be excluded from participating because they were considered unsuitable or did not comply with the protocol or safety precautions. However, such trials are usually regarded as having met all the required pre-specified criteria and therefore their results are generally accepted as sufficiently reliable to support claims made about a given medicine or procedure.

Where clinical trials were performed outside Europe and have findings for other countries they should also be reported in this way (see section 8 below).

2.1.5 Clinical trials carried out overseas

Clinical trials carried out outside the EU are subject to similar standards as those set for clinical trials within the EU. They are entitled to a licence to provide research services under the conditions laid down in Article 5(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001. This means that all clinical trials carried out outside the EU, including overseas, must follow the same safety and efficacy requirements and adhere to the same restrictions on the use of human subjects as apply within the EU. All studies involving human participants must report compliance with EU regulations relating to informed consent, information gathering, protection of volunteers' rights and confidentiality, the handling of blood and tissue samples and the collection, storage and destruction of biological specimens.

Q: What is the difference between menopause in women and menopause in men?

A: The menopause process starts at a much earlier age for most females than it does for males; in many cases, it's even happening before puberty. For this reason, the average age of onset for female MS is significantly lower (12 years) compared with male MS (25-30). There is no one single cause for female MS and as a result, there are also no simple treatments that will work for everyone. However, there are several things you can do to help reduce your risk.

gpt2-xl_1,"Chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, asthma, stroke etc. all lead to a loss of life due to complications and disability caused by them and can cause premature death due to various medical problems.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified chronic diseases into four broad categories, based on their impact on health-related quality of life or overall health status, with ""high"" risk of serious morbidity or mortality, ""low risk"", ""medium risk"" and ""low risk"". These categories reflect the prevalence of health conditions that significantly affect people's physical and mental well being and therefore contribute to their welfare in terms of economic productivity. The WHO classifies chronic diseases according to several factors, including underlying causes, genetic susceptibility, etiology, incidence patterns, prognosis, treatment strategies, cost effectiveness, public health impact, and global burden of disease estimates.


CVD (chronic heart disease): There were 6.5 million deaths from CVD globally in 2012 and this number is projected to rise sharply by 2030, with an estimated 1.2 billion people at high risk of suffering from CVD in 2050. By the year 2100, there will be 10.6% more people living with CVD than today in low income countries alone. Heart attacks are the main type of CVD causing approximately half of all deaths worldwide, while strokes account for another one third, and pulmonary embolism accounts for two thirds. A combination of factors contributes to CVD in developing nations, such as poverty, lack of access to healthcare and poor diet, and its highest rates occur in Asia, Africa and Latin America. This is particularly important when considering that the world population is growing faster than the average rate of increase of these regions and some populations could face a doubling of their age cohorts within decades. As a result of increased longevity, it is predicted that the burden from CVD will continue to grow over time.

Chronic liver disease: In 2010, the number of deaths from acute hepatitis B was estimated to reach 843 000 globally, accounting for 11% of total deaths due to infectious diseases. Although there is no specific estimate available for acute hepatitis C, around 20 000 new cases occur each year. It is estimated that one person dies every nine minutes from cirrhosis or related liver disorders in developing countries – nearly three times the amount of deaths per person that would occur if only 10% of those who die from cancer had liver disease. These diseases also pose a huge financial burden, especially because they can require complex treatment and long hospital stays",1,What are the most common chronic diseases?

gpt2-xl_105,"this is a common problem with many dentists. It's not always the dentist that needs to be careful, it can also happen when your dentist pulls the wisdom teeth out as a result of an infection. This causes your gums to bleed and cause pain and inflammation in the mouth. The best thing you can do for yourself is to use dental dams or gums that keep your gums from bleeding during any dental procedure.


Q: why should I take care of my teeth?A: The first step is to brush your teeth properly every day and eat healthy foods. If you have tooth decay, brushing your teeth everyday will help prevent decay in the future. When you do get cavities, fillings are easy to remove and fillings don't need to come out again! Be sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day to help flush away toxins. Never swallow anything from the toilet bowl. Do not let children under age 8 handle toothbrushes unless they are wearing a rubberized glove.


Q: how does my oral health compare to other people's?A: Your oral health is similar to others' but there are some things you can do to make them better. Take care of your diet and exercise regularly so your body has the energy needed to fight off infection. Try not to bite your lips or tongue and never chew food directly into your teeth. Don't put sugar or other sweeteners in your mouth until after they've been swallowed completely. If you have dry lips, try applying warm oil on the affected area. If the condition persists, see your doctor.


Q: what if I'm having trouble eating healthy? How can I improve my oral health?A: For those who struggle to stick to their new dietary habits, you may want to consider making small changes. You might try cutting back on sugary snacks, or maybe even cutting down on salt for good. These small adjustments may help you begin to feel healthier immediately. Once you've made these small steps, continue to watch your progress and see if you're able to find healthier ways to consume your favorite foods. If necessary, ask friends and family members to join you in making small improvements so you can continue to reap the benefits of a balanced diet.


Q: What about taking supplements?A: Taking supplements isn't recommended by most experts. However, vitamin D, calcium and magnesium can all play a role in maintaining proper oral health.

Q: Where would you like to live if you don't own property? \nA: I love living alone and owning my own home but life isn't cheap.

The only thing I want to do when I can afford to is visit friends, family and places I've lived in. The last time I visited my parents' home in Denmark we spent three days there, which was wonderful! It's hard to see things clearly while I have MS because every day I have to think about all those little details but I'd like to start travelling more again, especially overland.\r

\r


Q: What advice would you give someone with MS? \nA: If possible avoid driving for a few months before getting the right treatment. Also make sure you take regular breaks throughout the day and night. Try to eat well and drink lots of water. Drink plenty of coffee. Keep a diary. You may find that your symptoms begin to improve just from making these changes. If so, then go ahead and try changing one or two things at once instead of trying many things at once. There is no hurry and all you'll ever learn is that you don't have MS. If you're not ready to change your lifestyle yet, then wait until you're ready. Some patients decide at this stage that MS is too painful to continue on and so choose to stop their medication.\r

What About My Kidneys?

Many doctors recommend that if you want to lose weight you try to avoid protein in your diet and instead focus on whole foods like meat, fish, eggs, fruits, vegetables, nuts etc… There are several reasons why this works better than just cutting out proteins. If anything is being cut out then it will slow down digestion so your kidneys can process less of these nutrients. The other reason is simply that your body needs them (especially when your blood sugar level drops) and if you don't get enough of them from animal products, plants, legumes, etc.. then your kidneys will not function optimally. There is research showing that protein does indeed stimulate urination and thereby improves kidney health.


Is Ketosis the Same as Ketoacidosis?

The difference between ketogenesis and ketoacidosis is one of definition. Ketogenesis refers to the breakdown of fatty acids in the liver as a result of starvation, while ketoacidosis refers to the buildup of ketone bodies in the bloodstream. However both can happen at the same time. It has been shown in mice that very short term fasting causes rapid changes in brain structure and activity, similar to those seen during a diabetic coma. This suggests that ketosis can lead to ketoacidosis if prolonged. Also, it has been shown in rats that long periods of low carbohydrate intake can produce excessive ketones, which is what we experience in ketoacidosis.

Do I Have To Eat Only Fatty Meats For Low Carb?

No! You don't need to eat only fats and oils. We actually recommend eating lots of good sources of healthy fats such as seeds, nuts, avocados, olives, coconut oil etc… as well as plenty of carbohydrates (such as fruit, veggies, starchy carbs), since",35,Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?,-0.1019759029150009,4,q,9,0.025806451612903226,394,20
gpt2-xl_97,"a systematic review and meta-analysis

This review found that aerobic exercise was associated with beneficial effects on the following health outcomes: body weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease.

""Virtually every single study showed that regular exercise reduces the risk for some type of chronic condition,"" said lead author Dr. Richard J. Smith, an associate professor of clinical medicine at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, in a statement. ""However, one area we need to take note of is whether people who are not physically active can benefit from physical activity.""


The researchers evaluated the data from five observational studies conducted between 1985 and 2012. One of these studies included more than 14,000 individuals over age 50; the other four included about 16,500 subjects. Participants were classified as either inactive or actively engaged in aerobic activities based upon their self-reported frequency and intensity of their weekly exercise participation.

Researchers then compared each group's health status using 12 different measures, including weight, waist circumference (a measure of abdominal fat), blood pressure, and serum lipids. They also examined factors like smoking history, alcohol consumption, physical activity level, and education level.

After adjusting for all potential confounding factors, the team discovered that aerobic exercise provided the greatest protection against several chronic conditions. Specifically, aerobic exercise was significantly protective for obesity, elevated blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancer.


There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of death from any cause after controlling for factors such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, family history of cardiovascular diseases, and lifestyle habits like smoking status. However, there were differences by region—the United States had the highest rate of death from all causes, while the Netherlands had the lowest rate.


It should be noted that the researchers did find that moderate exercise training resulted in higher life expectancy. That being said, this doesn't necessarily mean that everyone needs to do it. As the researchers point out in their paper: ""For example, although vigorous activity is often recommended for older adults with cardiovascular disease, the evidence linking exercise to improved survival rates among frail persons has been inconsistent.""

Dr. Michael Blaha, director of medical informatics at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, told CNBC that the findings may provide new guidelines for physicians when they prescribe exercise therapy to patients.

Another exercise in this category is the ""push up"", where the body is raised off the ground by pushing with one arm. This works great as part of the core training programme!

Q: how much time can you spend on each exercise?A: 1 hour per day is sufficient. If your body requires more than that it's probably too much, so try to reduce the number of sets to 2 or 3, but keep them short as we don't want overtraining.

Q: do I have to be young to improve my posture?A: no, as long as you are at least 18 years old you should be able to achieve excellent results from the program. In fact many professionals say that older people can benefit from proper posture training as well. However, some specialists also advise against young adults doing routine yoga exercises because they may develop osteoporosis later on in life, which could lead to joint problems. It would certainly make sense to talk to your doctor if you want to know whether you need such advice before starting this programme.

Q: why should I train my stomach muscles?A: this group of muscles consists of all the ones surrounding your spine. They are responsible for keeping everything upright while eating; stretching these muscles will definitely increase your flexibility and your strength as a result. The stretches for the abdominal area are the same as those used for stretching the lower back. Do these movements with your legs stretched out straight out, like in the photo below.

Q: what about weight lifting?A: weight lifting is very important for improving posture; however, it isn't necessary for achieving good results. We recommend going slowly during the weight lifting sessions to avoid injuries, but we still recommend it as part of the overall programme.

Q: how do I strengthen my buttocks?A: this is another muscle group that needs strengthening to obtain optimal results. Situps are particularly effective for this purpose because they work both sides of the buttocks. Start with a few reps and gradually build up until you reach a maximum of 15 repetitions.

Treatment for Psoriasis/Acne

If you have psoriasis or acne, then you can use a combination of topical and oral anti-inflammatory medication to treat your condition. However, the choice is up to you as there are several different classes of medications that are available. Each class has its own set of benefits (which we will discuss later) but also has some disadvantages (such as drug interactions). The first thing to consider when choosing an anti-acne regimen is which type of acne you are dealing with. This can be tricky because it depends on what other symptoms exist in addition to the pimples and breakouts. Here's a quick look at the main types of inflammatory skin conditions and their treatment options.

Psoriasis

The most common type of inflammatory skin disease, this is basically a rash that develops around the hair follicles. It usually occurs under the arms where the skin is thinner. If left untreated, psoriasis can progress into more serious lesions such as abscesses, nodules, and cancers. In severe cases, it may even lead to death. While the cause remains unclear, one possible explanation is that excessive sebum production causes inflammation by damaging the cells lining the pores causing them to release free radicals that damage DNA and increase susceptibility to cancer. Anti-acne drugs such as minocycline, clindamycin, or erythromycin can help reduce inflammation and prevent any further progression into life threatening lesions. You should keep in mind though that sometimes these medicines will not work as well if you have been taking them for a long time. As you can imagine, using an anti-acne agent every day can add up quickly – so plan ahead with the appropriate frequency of usage.

Dandruff or Dry Skin

This condition is characterized by flaking, itching, dryness, and irritation caused by an overgrowth of bacteria that thrive in the environment. This imbalance leads to redness and itchiness around the face, neck, ears, and elsewhere. Acne treatments like salicylic acid products (the active ingredient in many shampoo brands), benzoyl peroxide (brand name Botox), and retinoids (also called Tretinoin) will all provide effective relief from dandruff but they do tend to exacerbate the symptoms of dry skin. To address both issues, choose an anti-acne cream or lotion to be used twice daily. For example,",132,headpats scalp psoriasis,-0.0370935089886188,0,q,9,0.0,383,5

It takes at least 12 months of daily therapy and other treatments until the disease progresses and causes signs or symptoms that are significant enough to be considered a disability. This time frame includes treatment with medications like Tysabri (etanercept), which may provide some relief from some types of MS-related symptoms such as numbness/tingling, muscle weakness, spasticity and cognitive problems.

Q: How can I protect myself from MS?\nA: The best way is to prevent MS through regular physical activity. There are also effective treatments available. For more information on MS check out www.multiplesclerosis.org.au/index.php.

Q: Can people with MS live independently?\nA: Yes. However, most people living with MS have limitations in their activities of daily life, such as caring for children and grandchildren.

Q: Do I need to get a job before I develop MS?\nA: It depends on whether you were born after 1950. If so, you should be aware that there has been an increased prevalence of MS over the past 20 years among young adults aged 15-29. As a result it's recommended that anyone under 30 who already has symptoms start looking for work early.

a. An estimated 5% to 10% of patients with MS are likely to be misclassified as relapsing-remitting by the clinical criteria used for diagnosis and treatment [4,8]. The current model was developed from the existing data that have been collected in this country during a 4 year period. The primary purpose is to estimate the magnitude of excess mortality among individuals with MS who may or may not have relapsed. The secondary goal is to develop an appropriate mechanism for calculating the risks associated with MS that might exceed those of other diseases. In addition, it will allow us to assess the relative importance of various aspects of life quality (e.g., physical, psychological) when attempting to identify factors influencing the risk of death. b. The primary objective is to calculate risks associated with each aspect of life, which might exceed those of other diseases, over time. c. These estimates are based on information received during telephone interviews with approximately 4000 respondents between 1989 and 1993. d. Results are presented using standard methods for extrapolation and calculation (Krueger, 1994). The data were weighted so that they would have equal numbers of men and women. e. A similar process has been employed in other countries where these surveys have been conducted since 1990 [10]. f. No attempt was made to account for possible differences in definitions of disability in different parts of the world. g. Estimates represent the number of deaths attributable to the disease over a given period divided by the total population. h. Statistical significance was assessed at the.05 level for all comparisons, except age-, sex-, and education-adjusted odds ratios, which were tested at the.001 level. i. Because these estimates cannot distinguish between true beneficial versus harmful effects, it is necessary to make adjustments for these effects if we wish to derive a ""true"" estimate of the hazard ratio (i.e., one that includes only true beneficial effects and excludes any harmful effects). j. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-0.0343601591885089,2,q,9,0.00980392156862745,341,3
gpt2-xl_54,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disease characterized by the presence of signs and symptoms including weakness, loss of mobility, and numbness or tingling sensations. MS affects approximately 1 in 100 adults throughout their lives, with an average age at onset of 55 years old. The vast majority (90%) of people diagnosed with MS are women; however men can develop the condition as well, especially after 30 years of age. Most cases of MS are preceded by an abnormally slow brain growth that causes a buildup of scar tissue. This leads to progressive damage over time, eventually leading to the formation of a lesion known as an active lesions. After this lesion forms, nerve fibers start to deteriorate, resulting in loss of function and sensory input from the affected area. MS also leads to disability because of severe muscle spasms and other symptoms. There are three types of MS: relapsing-remitting, secondary, and primary (primary is when there is no clear cause for the initial attack). Relapsing-remitting MS is marked by recurring attacks of fatigue that last several days to weeks. These may be preceded by a period where activity levels are low but then increase gradually. During these periods of increased activity, nerve cells become damaged as they try to repair themselves. Typically, relapses occur every 2 to 8 months, although they can happen more frequently if the immune system starts attacking healthy nerve cells. Secondary MS occurs in patients who have had an early relapse and whose symptoms continue to worsen. Primary MS is characterized by recurrent, often disabling attacks that begin suddenly and persist even with treatment. People with primary MS do not experience debilitating bouts of fatigue and typically recover fully within 5 to 10 years of diagnosis. Some people will need to take medication for life to control symptoms (regimen), while others will live full lives without any disability. A person's risk for developing secondary MS increases significantly during adolescence and young adulthood, which explains why so many people with MS end up living with the disease into later life. In addition, some people are born with autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and scleroderma, among others. For example, people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are twice as likely to get MS. While IBD itself does not directly contribute to MS, some studies suggest that certain foods may trigger MS",54,What does multiple sclerosis diagnosis include?

gpt2-xl_52,"Mental Health is a complex area of medicine with numerous sub-disorders, many of which need specialized treatment. The most commonly recognized disorders and their associated disorders include depression, anxiety disorder (ADHD), ADHD, bipolar disorder (manic depressive illness) and schizophrenia. Some individuals also have substance use disorders as well as other psychiatric diagnoses such as schizophrenia spectrum (schizoaffective disorder). One symptom of anxiety or depression is loss of interest in activities, hobbies, or social interactions, including those that may seem pleasant or pleasurable. People may worry excessively about what they see or hear, become easily frustrated or anxious, become apathetic to people and surroundings, avoid eye contact and conversation, and experience intrusive thoughts (for example, ""I don't like you""). Other symptoms of anxiety include being restless or having difficulty sleeping or relaxing, feeling overwhelmed by feelings of guilt, shame or worthlessness, feeling irritable or out of control, losing interest in going out into the world or doing things with friends, feeling hopeless and/or giving up. Many people suffer from an emotional eating disorder when they eat at inappropriate times or without eating certain foods because of fear of gaining weight. Others complain of sleep deprivation or oversleeping. Sometimes these symptoms are mild and go unnoticed but sometimes they lead to increased rates of self-harm, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and even violence. People with some types of physical illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, etc., can develop stress and/or anger issues. For people living with a mental illness, some types of medications can help reduce symptoms and improve mood.

Description:


In the summer of 2002, a 23 year old woman presented to a general practice complaining of having recurring nightmares, hallucinations, hypervigilance, and severe anxiety. She also had severe depression, which she described as ""a constant feeling that something terrible is going to happen"". The patient was initially treated with antidepressant drugs but then relapsed into her former patterns of behavior. Her parents were unaware of this previous history but were supportive of her decision to seek help from her psychiatrist in August 2003. A thorough interview and examination revealed no abnormalities on any clinical exam. There was no evidence of suicidal ideation or plan or intent to harm herself.


The patient's symptoms began after one month of regular employment in a sales position. Although she did well professionally, her job involved many tasks in repetitive daily routines without breaks for rest or recreation. She often felt overwhelmed by the amount of paperwork and required supervision by managers who did not always understand what she needed. She reported an increasingly difficult time maintaining her self-control when faced with social situations where these routine demands interfered with her ability to concentrate on tasks.

gpt2-xl_85,"Anecdotal reports that a patient who is relapsing remitted MS had a positive biopsy result for antibodies to TNF, which was the same as one of your patients. Is this an example of a drug-induced remission?

MRS: Biopsies are not diagnostic and cannot be used to diagnose MS. They can only be used as indicators in the case of suspected disease. In other words, they do not exclude or confirm disease. The fact that a patient with relapsing remitting MS has received a positive biopsy for IgG anti-TNF does NOT mean that he/she will get better from treatment. If a patient is considered at risk for relapse, then he/she should have another MRI (or another imaging test) performed.

Q: Do you recommend that every patient undergo a double-blind placebo controlled trial of an agent such as SOD1? And if so what kind of results would be expected?

MRS: Most important, we need to know why a patient gets better after being treated with an antibody. To answer these questions, one needs to evaluate an individual's response to treatment. This requires having an accurate biopsy. That means that a patient must first agree to an appropriate biopsy protocol before the doctor or laboratory begins doing it.

This means that there is no way to tell whether the patient has any potential benefit from treatment until she decides to take part in a clinical trial. It also means that there is no control group of healthy individuals. In order for an investigator to determine whether it's worthwhile taking a medication, he must assess both how much improvement a patient receives from his medication versus how well he responds to a placebo or sham treatment. Without good baseline data from a single person, we cannot make reliable conclusions about the efficacy of treatments like this. It's very possible that it could be true that something else happens, such as inflammation and immune system overreaction, that accounts for the patients' improved symptoms. However, because there isn't any evidence to suggest that this happens, I would not recommend that we try this approach.",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-0.0409731231629848,6,q,9,0.030456852791878174,348,3

• Unusual feeling of heaviness (vomiting, faintness), confusion, fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, irregular heartbeat, rapid breathing, sweating, muscle aches.


2) Restlessness, irritability, nervousness. These are not only signs of hypo-thyroidism but also of other diseases. Also, a child with poor concentration, trouble reading or writing, difficulty speaking, inability to sit still for long periods of time, and speech impediments may experience these changes as well. Some kids have trouble sleeping because they're tired all the time; others find it hard to concentrate because they become restless during class.

3) Increased appetite, weight gain and/or obesity. This is caused by an underactive thyroid gland producing too much iodine. In addition, children who don't eat enough tend to put on weight. Kids with Hashimoto's disease often have excessive hair growth, skin pigmentation, wrinkles around their eyes, enlarged lips, swollen glands inside their noses, and acne. Their facial features also change drastically, becoming more angular and less rounded than usual. As their bones get weak, they develop osteoporosis. Thyroiditis and lupus are two disorders that may increase this problem.

4) Mental problems. Some people feel confused, depressed and hopeless, even though there isn't any evidence that their brain chemistry has been changed. They might worry about getting sick again. Others feel anxious or anxious about making mistakes that could lead to injury or illness. All of these reactions usually go away when your doctor treats you with an antidepressant medication. Most of them disappear once the thyroid hormone levels are normal.

5) Weight gain. This is sometimes linked to eating too many carbohydrates (like candy and sugary foods), too many fat foods, dairy products (especially milk), and alcohol. You should avoid foods like potato chips and pastries, cookies, cakes, ice cream and soda pop. If you must eat sweets or fatty food, limit yourself to no more than one piece at a time or to less than 200 calories per day.

6) Low sex drive and fertility. This can be due to insufficient estrogen production or an imbalance between testosterone and progesterone. A woman's fertility is affected by her menstrual cycle",123,hypothyroidism symptoms,-0.7242324352264404,10,q,9,0.06172839506172839,383,1

gpt2-xl_55,"In my opinion, if you have MS and are not actively using medications or other therapies for your disease, then you should consider switching from the traditional pharmaceutical treatment of TNF inhibitors. If you want to try something new that may be more effective than existing treatments, you might benefit from trying a natural alternative such as turmeric (Curcuma longa).\N

Q: What is the best way to protect oneself against MS/TENSI?\nA: Although there are no proven studies that show any specific ways to prevent MS, I think it's important to recognize that it is very difficult to avoid the risk factors associated with MS by simply avoiding certain foods and behaviors that can trigger an immune response in susceptible individuals. For those who choose to take medication, I would recommend taking a low-dose version of the TNF inhibitor called diclofenac sodium (Voltaren), which only requires one tablet per day in addition to your standard multivitamins. One of the first steps toward managing MS is learning what triggers the symptoms of MS and how these triggers differ depending on the person's race, gender, and age. Taking care of yourself through diet and lifestyle changes will play a large role in helping you feel better during this time. There also is some evidence suggesting that dietary supplements can help reduce the inflammatory process when taken together with regular exercise, but further research needs to be done before we know whether or not this holds true.

Q: Can MS be reversed or mitigated by dietary measures alone?\nA: Yes. There is some evidence showing that eating more fiber, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, omega-3 fatty acids, and probiotics has been shown to improve the quality of life in people with MS.[7] I would recommend doing everything possible to incorporate these into your diet as well as to increase your intake of beneficial bacteria, which could be found naturally in yogurt or fermented foods. This means consuming probiotic products in addition to following a balanced diet, since both provide you with essential nutrients such as live bacteria. Many patients report that taking probiotics along with their medication actually helps to minimize side effects and reduce inflammation, so this idea of combining probiotic products with drugs is definitely worth exploring!\r

The other is to look at the solutions posted by others who solved the same problems. Try both and see which one you prefer (there isn't necessarily a right or wrong answer).

The study was a cross-sectional design, with participants being recruited from the community. The participants were not randomised to receive either intervention or control treatments; instead, they received an education package and a standard healthcare screening questionnaire before baseline (the first observation of which was in 2004). Participants who did not return for follow up were excluded from analysis. Data collection took place at both the baseline and post-baseline stages of the study.

We used the self-reported height and weight as described previously. 17, 18 Briefly, we asked each participant whether they had ever been told their height or weight was below normal or above average, and asked them if they knew someone else who felt this way. We also asked the age-and gender-matched comparison group how often they were aware that their own BMI was underweight (0%), overweight (1%) or obese (2%). When the answer was yes, we compared body mass index values between these groups using linear regression analysis. This enabled us to assess the relationship between BMI (in kg/m 2 ) and other measured characteristics across the entire range of BMI (<18.5), over three categories of obesity (>25% BF) and ≥30%. Weight was also measured at baseline, with a calibrated scale; BMI was calculated using the following formula: weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. Height was measured in centimeters. BMI is the most commonly used measure of adiposity globally. 18

To investigate the potential impact of different interventions on physical activity, we analysed all data including those collected at the two pre-treatment visits (2004–2005 and 2006–2007). To provide evidence about the impact of our interventions on dietary behaviours and nutrient intakes, we assessed total energy intake and macronutrient composition from both the clinic and home scales during the same two periods (2006–2007 and 2010–2011). At baseline, participants were instructed to complete a short online survey on food and exercise habits. This questionaire included questions on usual diet, consumption of specific foods, time spent at rest, activities undertaken while travelling, and the level of physical exertion required to undertake particular activities.

At baseline, participants completed a detailed medical history form and underwent comprehensive blood measurements. After a 24 h fast, they returned for follow-up examination after 3 months. At this visit, participants provided informed written consent to participate in the clinical trial. Participants who refused to take part were invited to return within 6 weeks.

C: Other symptoms that can be caused by MS or another medical condition. D: More than one symptom. E: Not sure. Q: What does the term fibromyalgia mean? A: The word ""fibroma"" comes from the Latin ""fibra,"" meaning muscle, and the Greek ""myalgia,"" which means pain. It has also been used to describe an illness characterized by widespread musculoskeletal complaints, such as muscle cramps or chronic joint inflammation. It was first described by Dr. James Ritvo, who is credited with developing the disease's name. In recent years, it's become a popular diagnosis among many patients because they often have fatigue, pain and sleep disturbances similar to those associated with MS.

Q: How do I know if my MS is caused by MS? A: You're more likely to develop MS if you have a family history of it; if your health problems are related to being overweight, obese or on antidepressants; if you've had any kind of stroke or trauma (such as accident or war); or if you've recently had chemotherapy or radiation treatment. Certain genetic mutations also increase your risk. But even if you don't have these conditions, having the same genes doesn't necessarily guarantee that you will get MS. About 20 percent of all adults over age 50 have MS at some point. Some people who don't normally have MS have milder symptoms than others. And some people have severe symptoms only after they start getting older. Many factors contribute to how severe your symptoms are — whether you suffer from fatigue, pain or shortness of breath. Your doctor will work with you to find out what's causing them and figure out what treatments might help you.

Q: What causes multiple sclerosis? A: Scientists don't fully understand why MS occurs, although they believe most cases involve damage to nerve cells in the central nervous system (CNS). There aren't any specific triggers for MS. However, certain factors may increase your risk of the disease. These include: smoking; exposure to toxins such as lead or asbestos; excessive alcohol use; ultraviolet light, including solar UV rays (from sun-lamps and tanning beds) and artificial lighting; infections in childhood or adulthood; infections during pregnancy; exposure to viruses and bacteria; having inherited blood clotting disorders; and diabetes. People with diabetes may also face additional risks from their body",68,List of multiple sclerosis symptoms,-1.553568959236145,13,q,9,0.058823529411764705,406,12

B: Multiple sclerosis stage B = 1; C = 2; D = 3; E=4; F = 5 (see Table 4 for a list of all MS symptoms in the table). In addition, only these four conditions are considered to be early onsets or relapses (i.e., the beginning of a new phase within the same MS patient): (a) ICTP/CIDI: ICTP/cidI is the first (or lowest) stage of a progressive disease characterized by neurodegeneration that manifests clinically as fatigue, cognitive impairment, seizures, sensory disturbances, speech difficulties, and ataxia [30]. The CIDI includes three components, namely, myelin dysfunction, axonal atrophy, and demyelination. At least one component must occur before the third-stage diagnosis can be made. If more than two components are present, it is called the ""multiple sclerosis spectrum"" (MSS). All individuals with a primary MS case who have at least one of their CIDs, including CIDI, are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS), whereas those without any CIDs but who exhibit signs and symptoms consistent with the later onset of MS (known as secondary cases) are generally classified as having relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) [31]. Relapsing MS is defined by progression from a non-progressive to a progressive course during which time there may be changes in disability or other symptomatology over periods up to several years [32]. It has been suggested that RRMS patients might benefit from treatment strategies intended to slow down the rate of progressive change and thus hasten recovery from relapses rather than the aggressive management advocated for secondary cases [33]. However, some recent data suggest that in both primary and secondary cases, the prognosis after relapse is worse than expected even if the initial course of the disease is milder or less severe [34]. For instance, patients with an early onset of multiple sclerosis (ICD10 code C41–C42 or C47) were compared with those with earlier onset or a milder or less severely affected course (ICD10 codes R21–R23) [35]. They found that patients with early onset had better survival rates regardless of",57,multiple sclerosis stages phases,-0.028971467167139,0,q,9,0.0,363,9

Treatment of primary progressive multiple sclerosis with antiepileptic drugs is difficult, and there are no approved drug regimens for this type of disease. Treatment consists primarily of symptomatic control through analgesics and antihistamines that have minimal side effects.1-3 The main aim of treatment is to increase motor recovery by controlling the inflammation caused by the brain lesion.4 It has been proposed that the addition of methylprednisolone may alleviate symptoms, but further studies are needed to determine whether this approach is effective in patients.2,5

The first clinical case series describing a patient treated with steroids was published almost 20 years ago,6 with the publication of additional cases of steroid use over time.7 In 1989, Cairns8 described a 28 year old woman who had progressed rapidly with progressive focal neurologic signs in both eyes. She received corticosteroid injections weekly throughout the course of her illness. Eventually she developed partial visual loss; however, her vision was partially restored after a course of oral prednisone. Following the publication of the study of Cairns,9 other reports on steroids were reported.10,11 More recently, a series of 16 patients with Sjogren's syndrome 12 and progressive unilateral paralysis who began steroid therapy during their second or third year of illness 12 described how steroids continued to be used until 6 months before death.13 These cases provided more evidence of benefit to steroid therapy than previous reports.14 The lack of consistent findings regarding adverse events and efficacy among these reports suggests that steroid therapy may cause serious complications if not carefully administered.15,16

In 2003, Jang et al17 conducted a prospective multicenter trial comparing the effectiveness of intravenous dexamethasone versus placebo in the treatment of patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis. They found a significant reduction in disability scores at 3 and 6 months, suggesting that dexamethasone could be safely used in patients who responded to corticosteroids. However, they also noted that the response rate was low at only 31% in this subgroup, making it unlikely that all of the patients would achieve a response. In 2006, we followed up those patients whose corticosteroid treatment was stopped early when symptoms declined.18 Of 17 patients treated with",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-0.4085630178451538,47,q,9,0.3533834586466165,380,13
gpt2-xl_93,"Yes. Some studies have shown a relationship between MS and sleep difficulties. The more severe the MS, the greater is the risk of developing memory problems and sleep disturbances. There are many possible reasons for these effects (e.g., changes in the body's response to hormones during sleep) that are not well understood. Sleep disorders may also be associated with other conditions such as depression, anxiety, or cognitive decline. It is important to remember that the role of REM sleep and NREM sleep (the period between dreams) in the maintenance of health and wellness cannot be neglected.

Q: Is there any evidence that aging has an impact on cognition?\nA: No. In fact, research suggests age-related declines may actually increase your brain's ability to learn new things. For example, in one study of healthy seniors aged 70 years or over, learning tests were conducted using materials that had been adapted from children's books. Those who could name more words learned significantly faster than those who couldn't.

Q: What causes cognitive decline in later life?\nA: Many factors contribute to declines in thinking skills and memory. These include physical illness (such as Parkinson's disease), medication side effects, infections, medications used to treat diseases and medical conditions (including cancer treatments), stroke, traumatic brain injury, and mental illnesses such as dementia. Studies show that Alzheimer's patients tend to experience poorer outcomes in terms of memory, problem solving, language, decision making, planning, abstract reasoning, verbal fluency, attention, and executive function.

Q: Do you know if I would benefit from treatment with certain supplements?\nA: Unfortunately, there isn't much good evidence linking specific vitamins, minerals, herbs, and nutrients directly to cognitive health and general cognitive functioning. However, there is some support for the notion that certain foods can help improve cognitive function, including: omega-3 fatty acids; green leafy vegetables (especially spinach); nuts, legumes, seeds, berries, and cruciferous vegetables (like broccoli); green tea; black pepper; calcium; and vitamin D.

What happens to older siblings (over the age of 20) who don't qualify for a DLA?

We will let them stay on the family home allowance until they turn 22 years old, after which point they become eligible for their own personal allowance. If this applies to you, contact us before the end of the year to see whether we can make arrangements for you to continue to receive support through these payments even though you are moving house.

Do I need to prove my household income?

You do not need to provide proof of your household income when you apply to join the DLA. However, some people might choose to do so because it helps them get around the rules. For example, you could show your council tax bill and ask us to reduce your housing costs as part of your application if the total amount you pay in council tax each week isn't enough to cover your rent or mortgage.

The DLA also has special rules for those who earn less than £11,500 per year. If you fit into this category, you can't use the new income-related test. Instead, you'll have to have been on a low paid job for at least three months prior to joining the DLA, or you won't qualify for a DLA at all. The same goes for earnings above £18,200 per year - although those earning between £17,800 and £23,400 should already have had experience with the Income Support system.

DISCUSSION The results of our meta-analysis support previous reports on a positive association between prostate cancer risk and serum testosterone levels.8 However, it is unclear whether high serum testosterone concentrations are causally associated with an increased risk of developing prostate cancer, or if high testosterone concentrations may be protective against developing prostate cancer. Some studies have reported that low-grade PCa patients with elevated serum testosterone concentrations had lower Gleason grade at diagnosis than did their counterparts with normal plasma testosterone concentrations.7 One plausible explanation for these observations could be that elevated serum testosterone concentrations result in decreased expression of PSA in early stage PCa. It has been shown in vitro that low-grade PCa patients can produce up to 10% less PSA than do healthy men.4 This reduction in expression of PSA, which causes a decrease in PSA secretion and thereby decreases PSA production, may protect against prostate cancer development. In addition, one study demonstrated that PCa patients with higher than normal serum testosterone concentrations showed reduced tumor growth rates compared with those with lower serum testosterone concentrations (Figures 1 and 2), thus supporting the hypothesis that high serum testosterone concentrations might confer protection against prostate cancer. On the other hand, some authors have argued that PSA testing should not be used to diagnose early stage prostate cancer because of its potential to affect the endocrine system.18 Although some researchers suggest that PSA levels are not helpful as predictors of the presence of prostate cancer,3,12 there remain many questions about the effects of low-grade PCa on the endocrine system. Serum testosterone concentrations in patients with PCa vary greatly, ranging from 0 to 20 ng/dL. There have been few prospective studies comparing the effect of different concentrations of testosterone on prostate cancer risk. As suggested by earlier studies,9,14,15,19 the level of serum testosterone that seems most favorable is estimated to be around 10 ng/dL.20 Therefore, the following question remains unanswered: Are there any adverse consequences associated with high versus low serum testosterone concentrations?",116,outcome prostate cancer,-9.629966735839844,112,q,9,0.45161290322580644,386,12

#8: a lot of patients have pain/shaking in their hands, feet and lower body.

A: This is a very common complaint among patients with LME. It's also called ""joint impingement"". The problem is usually caused by an over-stretching or over-tearing at the joints of the spine. If you look closely at your back and arms, you should see some small areas that are inflamed, tender to touch, red, swollen or painful. These are not necessarily your joints! You'll notice these signs if you sit or stand for long periods of time during treatment. This may be due to some other condition such as a headache, nausea, loss of appetite etc. or it could simply indicate a softening at the joint. When this happens, the patient will develop chronic pain along the affected area. We recommend regular physical therapy or stretching exercises along with appropriate medications to help relieve the inflammation. However, it's important to note that all pain and discomfort associated with LME is completely normal and expected. The symptoms do not occur because there's something wrong with the patient but rather they happen because of the stress placed on the muscles or nerves of the spine which results from a poor alignment of the spine during a lifetime of sitting or standing.


Lymph node changes after LME.

In many cases of low back pain, the initial injury was caused by a fall from a high place and so we would expect to find the same types of findings in patients who've had the experience of falling off a chair or ladder. Unfortunately most of us don't fall down often enough, or our parents didn't teach us how to make good use of ladders! In the case of LME, we found no significant difference between those patients whose falls occurred while they were seated and those who fell when they stood up. But, more recent studies suggest otherwise. As explained above, one study reported a higher incidence of LME in persons with a history of severe back pain compared to those without such an account.[1] Another study confirmed this finding. A retrospective analysis found that in 8 of 11 patients studied the fall happened before the onset of pain. Some researchers believe that since the injuries were often traumatic they trigger a response in the spinal cord of some sort which creates a hyperactive signal in the nerves that cause pain.[2] Again, this isn't true at all but rather just a theory based on",101,heavy flares swelling lymph nodes,-9.717934608459473,64,q,9,0.5203252032520326,422,1

Q: how long does it take to get better from an illness?\nA: The number one reason patients say they don't want to change their symptoms is that they fear that doing so will make them worse. This belief can be due either to fear of relapse or not wanting to acknowledge problems to themselves. There is no way to predict if a person with an anxiety disorder will have a good outcome during treatment. Some people do get better more quickly than others. When someone says he/she is getting better, however, it means that the anxiety has decreased significantly. Some people also believe it takes time to heal an illness. Others think a person must be miserable before they feel better. In fact, anxiety disorders are treatable. If you're convinced you'll never feel better, find another way to cope. But, if you know you're going to get better, you need to accept your life as normal and start taking steps toward recovery.


Q: what causes anxiety?\nA: Anxiety disorders occur when the body releases stress hormones into the bloodstream called catecholamines. These hormones trigger many different types of chemical reactions within the brain, such as the release of adrenaline into the blood stream. This increases heart rate and breathing and prepares the body for action. While there are several possible causes of anxiety, two are most common:1) Trauma2) A chronic disease\u00a0 \u003c\/span\u003e

Trauma: A traumatic experience, such as sexual assault or abuse, can lead to a wide range of physiological changes in the body. For example, while some memories might fade over time, other memories may last longer than usual and become harder to forget. Other memories may be affected by sleep deprivation, causing memory gaps. Nightmares can increase the amount of stress hormone levels in the brain and produce anxiety. Trauma often occurs in childhood, but can happen at any age. For example, individuals who were abused as children may develop PTSD. Symptoms of trauma include physical pain, irritability, flashbacks, nightmares, increased arousal, and sleep disturbances. As a result, the body starts producing chemicals like cortisol to prepare the body for fight-or-flight responses. Cortisol works by releasing energy stored up",53,what is psychotherapy?,-3.909404993057251,17,q,9,0.09444444444444444,396,4

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and rheumatic fever are considered autoimmune diseases in which the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells, causing them to attack their own tissues. RA is a disease of unknown cause that develops after an injury or infection and most often affects the joints, skin and lungs. It occurs in 1 out of 50 people. Most cases progress over several years but some may go on for decades. Symptoms vary depending on the site where symptoms occur, whether they have flares or become severe, how quickly they progress and what stage they are at when diagnosed. There is currently no cure but medications can help control symptoms.Rheumatic fever is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). The bacteria causes inflammation of the airways and lungs as well as other organs such as kidneys and bladder, and it is usually milder than RA. However, MAP can be fatal and has killed many children who were born prematurely and had previously been healthy. Symptoms typically begin one week to four weeks after exposure. Most infections resolve within two months but if left untreated, MAP can develop into pneumonia.Symptoms include fever, chills, fatigue, coughs, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, swollen glands and sometimes red eyes and swelling of the face and hands. If the infection spreads beyond these early stages, it can result in a life-threatening lung infection called tuberculosis. Symptoms of RA include joint pain, muscle aches and stiffness, bone pain, kidney problems and other organ damage. A person with RA or Rheumatoid arthritis can also experience severe symptoms from the autoimmune condition Sjogren's syndrome.",108,chronic diarrhea short-term memory sweating inability to regulate body temperature heart palpitations dysautonomia,-4.294914722442627,4,q,9,0.06779661016949153,271,2

The most important aspects of the Atkins diet are cutting out sugar and refined carbohydrates, and replacing them with fresh produce. Many patients have reported improvements in their blood glucose levels.

Q: What happened to my blood sugar level after I quit eating gluten?A: If you were following an Atkins-type diet for several months, your blood sugar should have dropped significantly. But it may take weeks or even months for symptoms to disappear completely. It takes time for your body's own healing mechanisms to kick in. Gluten does not cause significant damage to the small intestine, but it can make the digestion of nutrients more difficult. Your doctor will evaluate your situation carefully before prescribing any kind of medication. He or she might recommend other approaches as well.

Q: My body isn't used to losing weight, so I don't feel great after I lose 5 pounds!A: Most people respond very positively to weight loss, and many experience increased energy and better moods. However, everyone responds differently to this type of treatment. Weight loss surgery (which includes gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy and/or liposuction) involves substantial surgical procedures, including incisions under the chin, stomach and intestines, as well as extensive scarring. Because of these risks, it is often difficult to achieve long-term weight loss. Although some research suggests that obesity itself may be linked to heart disease, there is no clear evidence linking long-term obesity to serious medical problems such as stroke or cancer. For a successful outcome, your surgeon would advise against trying to slim down by eliminating certain foods or calories from your diet.

Q: Is it safe to eat gluten-free if I'm allergic to wheat?A: Eating gluten without being severely intolerant to it probably won't harm you. In fact, you may find that wheat and other grain products taste better than when they're made with gluten. A few studies suggest that people who avoid all types of food containing gluten aren't at greater risk of developing allergies later on. While it's true that celiac disease – which causes chronic inflammation and damage to the small intestine – is an autoimmune disorder, it doesn't require celiac antibodies. So if you're currently healthy enough to tolerate gluten, avoiding it shouldn't pose any problem.",45,Can diabetes be cured?,-1.085937261581421,32,q,9,0.25396825396825395,398,5

Treatment Options


The most common treatment for acute asthma is inhaler therapy. A respiratory therapist or physician can help determine your best option at the time. An oral steroid may be prescribed as a second choice if your first medication has not been effective and you have severe breathing difficulties (see Treatment section below). The use of an inhaled corticosteroid such as prednisone (prednisolone) or hydrocortisone (hydrocortisone injection) in adults will result in greater short-term relief of symptoms than do topical steroids that are typically used to treat acute exacerbations. However, it should be noted that long-term use of these medications can cause adverse effects including gastrointestinal problems, increased blood pressure, or even liver damage.[1]

Inhaling pure oxygen from the air supply through a mask with a face mask can relieve some symptoms caused by the high concentrations of carbon dioxide inside the lungs, but other symptoms remain even when these gases are removed by this technique. Some experts recommend waiting until your asthma attack resolves before using masks with faces to aid in breathing.[2] You must have difficulty breathing without the mask because the breathing process involves gas exchange. To remove any residual gas trapped between the two walls of the mask, you need to breathe into it. Therefore, if your lung function begins to deteriorate after using a mask with a face mask, you may want to reconsider using such a device.

Some experts recommend using a nasal inhaler, which provides better control over your asthma symptoms. This type of inhaler allows you to take larger breaths and requires less frequent inhalation. If you are having trouble controlling your asthma symptoms while wearing a mask with a face mask, try switching to a nose spray or nasal ointment containing benadryl, methylphenidate, or salicylic acid (acetaminophen). These remedies work by blocking the release of histamine from mast cells, which causes sneezing, runny noses, and hives.[3]

Many children also experience wheezing and breathlessness, especially during an asthma attack. As they get older, their symptoms change and they may begin to lose control of their attacks. It is important to keep an eye on your child's condition and make sure he receives appropriate medical attention when he becomes too ill or refuses treatment.

Treatments for Ehlers Danlos Syndrome

Treatment of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome is complex and requires a multidisciplinary team of specialists in neurology, orthopedic surgery, endocrinology, psychiatry, urology, hematology/oncology, gastroenterology, anesthesiology, rheumatology, pediatrics, and others to properly treat this condition. Some people with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome are genetically predisposed to develop it or suffer from genetic variations which make them more prone to developing it. The diagnosis of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome is made by conducting tests on blood samples taken from the person. If the test shows signs of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (e.g., abnormal heart rate), doctors may refer patients for further testing.

What treatments are available for Ehlers Danlos Syndrome?

There aren't any specific drugs that can be prescribed directly for Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. However, there are certain medications that can help alleviate symptoms associated with EDS.

Cortisone injections can reduce joint swelling

Exercise therapy exercises the muscles used in walking and running

Anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen may relieve muscle stiffness and inflammation

Steroids such as Prednisone can increase circulation around joint areas

The Mayo Clinic offers information about Ehlers Danlos Syndrome.

How serious is Ehlers Danlos Syndrome?

Ehlers Danlos Syndrome affects only a small percentage of the population. Most cases appear to resolve over time without treatment. People who suffer from EDS should take care to follow their doctor's advice regarding exercise, diet, stress management, and medication. They also need to understand how they're feeling and be willing to discuss how long they expect these changes to last.

gpt2-xl_83,"MS is an autoimmune disease. When the immune system attacks your own body, it can cause symptoms like pain and numbness in your legs (called peripheral neuropathy), or damage to nerves that control movement (called central nervous system disorders). The most common form of MS is called relapsing-remitting MS. In this type of MS, the immune system attack your brain, spinal cord, and other parts of your body; then these areas react again with inflammation. Relapse occurs when the inflammation starts over again within several weeks. Since MS is a lifelong condition, relapses are common, and even more so during pregnancy. This is why getting diagnosed with MS as a relapse is important for you to know about before trying for a baby.

Q: What does being pregnant do to my body?\nA: Pregnancy increases your risk of developing MS. Although there has been some research on the effects of pregnancy on women who have had MS, many researchers still don't know if pregnancy is associated with increased risk for MS. However, one study found that women whose MS was treated early in pregnancy had lower levels of inflammatory biomarkers than those who were given treatment later in pregnancy, suggesting they may be at less risk from having MS than other women.

Cannabis Use During Pregnancy

There is no known evidence that cannabis use affects birth outcomes, including miscarriage or premature delivery. However, it's possible that marijuana use in late pregnancy may increase a woman's chance of having low Apgar scores, which indicates that your baby was born alive but less than full term. Therefore, ask your health care provider about ways to limit your exposure to THC while you're pregnant.

Women who smoke cannabis throughout pregnancy have been found to have higher rates of preterm birth. Research on marijuana smoking during pregnancy remains inconclusive because little research has been done on this subject. Because there isn't enough information to draw strong conclusions regarding its effect on fetal growth, women shouldn't start using cannabis until they're sure that it won't affect their unborn child.

The body is able to heal itself, but it is unable to stay in good condition at all times and will eventually break down completely. This is a result of our genetics which dictates how much we can take from the environment when given enough time. We are also affected by other factors such as environmental toxins, stress, and overwork, and these often lead to some form of chronic disease in which a person's genes dictate their physical condition and susceptibility to disease.

Q: How does chronic pain affect your life?\nA: Pain is an inevitable part of life. However, it is not necessarily bad if you manage it properly and learn the skills required to avoid it entirely. Some people, however, get caught up in pain and become addicted to it which can cause them to neglect their work or their relationships. For example, many people suffer from insomnia because they wake up constantly in excruciating pain. Others may be plagued by poor eating habits due to frequent stomach aches; some people find themselves spending hours every day driving around in circles looking for parking spaces! In addition, chronic pain affects both mental health and physical health. It causes people suffering from depression to feel worthless and hopeless, leading to suicide attempts. In contrast, healthy individuals rarely experience this level of emotional distress (i.e., sadness). Therefore, there are some ways that one can prevent chronic pain by managing one's diet, exercise, and sleep habits so that one doesn't run into it in the first place.

Q: Why should I care about my health?\nA: Everyone has a basic human right to live without experiencing any type of harm or discomfort.

Dental disease in adults is the most common and costly problem encountered by children. It may cause chronic pain, discomfort, and infection. When dental problems are present, they often lead to oral pain, which can be severe enough to interfere with a child's daily life.1-4 Children who have significant pain or discomfort caused by dental diseases often require dental care and medications.5 Dental problems occur when a person suffers an injury that makes it difficult for teeth to form (cavities). Cancers (such as cancerous and noncancerous) also damage or destroy teeth and gums; these types of lesions are known as periodontal disease. Periodontitis causes inflammation on the bone between the root of a tooth and the surface tissues surrounding the tooth.6 The inflammatory process leads to increased blood flow to the soft tissue tissues around the tooth. This changes how the cells of the tooth function—making them smaller.7 Most children with periodontitis don't experience any symptoms at first. They develop painful spots that become infected over time if not treated.8 As the bacteria infect the tooth surfaces, they grow and multiply, creating pockets where more growth occurs.9 These spaces usually contain large amounts of dead cells and fluid called plaque. Plaque accumulates inside and around the tooth because bacteria love to consume sugars and starches found in food.10 In addition to causing discomfort, untreated plaque can make the teeth brittle and cause decay.11 Inflammation has been shown to reduce salivary flow and lead to more frequent and serious toothache.12 The bacteria are able to travel through gingival crevices to the pulp chamber of the tooth, from where they produce acid.13-16 The acid produces acidic saliva, which protects the teeth against the effects of acid produced by mouth flora.17 If there are no antibiotics available to treat this condition, antibiotics can help stop the progression of inflammation and protect the teeth.18-23

""This information may be viewed as a conflict of interest,"" Ms. Hecht said. ""There are situations where it would not benefit either party to have their medical conditions revealed."" But she added that there was no specific policy on disclosure among her group's members.

But when Ms. Hecht and other advocates say they can find few differences between disability insurance for employees and medical benefits provided by employers or third parties — unless those who have them opt out — it becomes difficult to explain why the programs should exist at all. For one thing, many people with disabilities do not qualify because of financial constraints. Some live on disability payments and may not want to enroll in an employer plan. And many employers provide disability coverage as part of health care plans and require employees' permission to switch to a new plan if their current one goes away.

Some employers simply prefer having a doctor or nurse available to manage employee claims while working. Others, including large corporations like IBM, choose to pay doctors directly rather than rely on an insurer to cover their costs.

And some companies don't think they need such coverage. In its 2006 annual report, AT&T listed as its top priority maintaining a high level of corporate flexibility in providing disability benefits. The company did not answer questions about whether it had any disabled workers, or how much it pays each worker toward a disability fund.

At the same time, the private sector has been slow to make major changes to its benefits policies. There is little pressure from customers to raise premiums as premiums climb. And even though research shows that the longer someone works without retirement savings, the more likely he or she will become disabled, most Americans lack access to defined-benefit pensions and instead face a complex web of options from which to choose.

""I'm not sure this program serves the goal that people were promised. We're paying more money for fewer services. That seems wrong.""

Mr. Tarter says it is important to keep in mind that many people with disabilities get the support they need from public and private agencies.

The most common example is type 2 diabetics who have not been able to use their diabetic medications as well because of the side effects associated with them. Also, many patients with cancer or other disease processes where blood sugar control is a major concern may benefit from this kind of diet. Finally, if you have a condition that causes your liver and/or kidneys to become damaged - such as hepatitis C - you may want to avoid these diets. If you have any questions about whether a particular dietary plan is appropriate for you, consult your physician or a registered dietitian.

Q: What are the benefits / risks of eating a ketogenic / keto diet?\nA: I don't know of any studies in humans showing that a low-carb, high-fat (LCHF) diet offers any health benefits over a normal diet. But there are certainly ways that a low-carb, high-fat (LCHF) diet can help improve cardiovascular risk factors - especially LDL cholesterol. There's also evidence that a ketogenic / keto diet reduces appetite, promotes weight loss, and helps with symptoms associated with mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc. So it seems possible that it could be helpful for certain people to reduce their carb intake so they can lose weight better. Another way that a LCHF approach might work is by lowering levels of inflammatory molecules in the body. It's also possible that a low-carb diet might increase levels of testosterone in men - since testosterone is known to play a role in fertility and sexual function. And of course, there's still the potential for dangerous complications from a high-carb diet. For now though, I think that it's best to focus on keeping weight off and avoiding complications.


Q: What does it mean when someone says that they're following a ketogenic / keto diet?\nA: Most often this means having the fats removed entirely and replacing them with carbs. You can read more about what this actually means on my article How to eat a ketogenic / keto diet. A more detailed description of a ketogenic / keto diet can be found here:

Table 3 shows how the results change when we include other covariates. We included gender as a continuous predictor because women tend to be more active than men. In addition, we added age to the model to allow us to test whether any effects of physical activity on the incidence of heart failure are dependent upon sex or age alone. Finally, we included socioeconomic status as an additional covariate. We found that none of our variables significantly predicted the risk of having heart failure; however, we did find an association between BMI and increased risk of heart failure. Specifically, we found that overweight people had about twice the risk of having heart failure as normal weight people. This relationship held even after controlling for sex, education, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. These findings suggest that obesity may lead to heart failure through a process known as dyslipidemia, which is characterized by elevated blood pressure and cholesterol levels. It has been suggested that dyslipidemia may also increase risk factors such as high blood pressure and low HDL.25-27 Thus, this study suggests that there exists a positive correlation between obesity and heart failure independent of other risk factors.

We next investigated the effect of physical activity on heart failure by using the Cardiovascular Risk Factor Surveillance System (CRFS).28 The CRFS is designed to monitor disease occurrence among US adults with risk factors for cardiovascular disease.29 Because of its design, it is possible that individuals who have heart failure will not participate in regular clinical examinations. However, they do undergo extensive clinical evaluations during routine medical visits. As such, we were able to obtain information from CRFS about the prevalence of physical activity. Using these data, we estimated that in 2002, 19.1% of all American adults reported participating in some form of moderate-to-vigorous leisure time physical activity (defined as ""some"" physical activities ≥15 minutes per week).30 These participants were followed for 1 year before being followed for 2 years following their heart failure diagnosis.

Q: You started training for your first Ironman in 2002. What are your current plans?

A: I am still racing every year but not on the weekends. My goal at this point is to be able to run 26 miles or better every week which would give me about 100-110 days per year where I can train hard and push myself. I'm currently running 6 hours a day and doing the long runs as fast as possible. When you're doing that you get tired very quickly. Running 25 miles in 3 hours gives you such a good pump that you don't feel like you need to stop. This will make me better prepared going into my next season so when there is another race coming up it won't take too much time to recover.

Q: Do you run anything other than road races?

A: I do two 50k events each year with the USATF 50 Mile National Championship coming up in May. Also last fall I ran the American Half Marathon Championships in San Francisco which is a 10,000m race. I also did a 5K here in Chicago. That should keep me busy until mid-to-late June when I will start doing the road races again.

Worst case scenario, if you're not getting any improvement in your symptoms after 3 months of using a shampoo or conditioner containing tretinoin you can switch to an alternative product that doesn't contain retinol. If you are still experiencing some redness or itchiness after 2-3 months and it's bothering you then you may have tried too much too soon. The best way to get rid of this is by gradually reducing the amount applied at each weekly shower until you reach the lowest amount necessary for your skin type. For example, someone with oily skin might apply less than 15ml per week while someone with dry skin would use more than 60ml per week. This should help reduce the appearance of the redness and itching. After one month you will probably notice little to no effect from the product so continue applying the same amount as before even though there may be noticeable reductions in efficacy.

If you want to increase your chances of success you should use a more gentle cleanser which does not strip off the outermost layer of your skin like many commercial products do. The best option is the Clarisonic Cleansing Cloths. They don't irritate the skin nor do they cause break outs. Try them out first to see whether they suit your needs and whether you prefer their texture over the Clarisonic Scrub. It also helps to try to avoid cleansing during the night because they tend to clog pores. If you find yourself feeling irritated by certain products we suggest switching to one which contains other ingredients such as aloe vera, avocado oil, rosehip seed oil or shea butter.

Tretinoin is available through most pharmacies but can also be purchased online at www.theclarisscrub.com (affiliate link) or at any drugstores including Boots.

The medications that are prescribed after a relapse of MS will help slow down or stop the progression of your symptoms and get you back on track toward a normal life.

With time, you may be able to return to work or other activities where you previously enjoyed success. However, it may take several months before your symptoms improve enough so that you can resume your previous level of functioning.

It should also be noted that if you have other chronic illnesses such as diabetes or heart disease, this process can take longer because of additional complications and challenges involved in managing both conditions at once.

Q: How long does the course of MS last?\nA: There is no set time frame for how long MS stays in remission – all depends upon individual body chemistry. But research has shown that between 4-7 years following the initial diagnosis, there is significant improvement in many people who experience relapses. Most studies show that by age 50 years, the rate of relapse has declined significantly among those affected by MS.

When the first signs of MS arise, a person experiencing a relapse will typically experience fatigue, loss of appetite, memory problems, dizziness, headaches, weakness and muscle pain. At times, these symptoms may appear immediately following a relapse, but they usually fade over time. These symptoms do not necessarily indicate that another relapse is imminent. You may still experience some of the same symptoms when you first develop symptoms. This is what makes them difficult to predict!

Q: What type of treatments exist now for MS?\nA: Multiple sclerosis has three main forms: progressive (or active), secondary (or dormant) and remitting (or dormant). Progressive MS is characterized by gradual decline in cognitive ability over years. For example, one day someone may be completely blind from MS and then slowly begin to regain vision over time. A second person may become paralyzed due to MS in his/her 20s; the paralysis may progressively worsen over time. Finally, a third person who has had MS for decades may have little chance of developing full disability until their 80s. Secondary MS is characterized by rapid onset of symptoms followed by gradual worsening in function. In contrast, patients with latent (or delayed) MS generally experience more severe disease than either primary or secondary MS patients. They exhibit less improvement over time and tend to progress at a much slower pace. Remittent MS occurs in only 1% of cases. It is characterized by sudden relapse of symptoms following periods of relatively",94,When will I start to feel better with multiple sclerosis?,-0.1895521581172943,3,q,10,0.014150943396226415,429,13

Are there any brands that fit well under 36DD?A: I don't know if this has been asked before, but since this question got more than 1,000 upvotes, let me try to answer it. If your bra size changes over time or gets bigger or smaller, it might be because you have too much tissue. You may need to go down a band size or down one cup size. When shopping for a new bra, look for bras with a low center gore, so that the cups will fit better on your body type without digging into your armpits, which can cause back pain. In general, bras with straps that aren't adjustable work best if you have medium-to-large breasts. The strap should also be set higher on your rib cage than on your shoulders -- usually 2 inches above the upper breastbone, although it varies based on your body shape. If you get a very small amount of support from the straps, try wearing them closer together; the bra should be snug enough around your neck but not covering your shoulder blades, so that you don't end up looking like an astronaut hugging your boobs. Don't use padded bras unless they meet your other safety requirements.Q: Hey! I just bought an old bra from Walmart that isn't in good condition but still fits great and makes me feel amazing in it!

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says that the risk of these other conditions is low, and they can be treated easily with medication. However, it notes that there are cases when more extensive treatment is necessary: ""These can include spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, fetal death and congenital abnormalities. It may also involve a life-threatening condition such as placenta previa or fetal macrosomia.""

In this case, the doctors say that there is no evidence that the baby has any abnormalities. The parents agree, saying that while their child's face looks different, she has been growing well since birth. They argue that the symptoms are similar to those caused by a disease called Guillain Barre Syndrome – which causes inflammation of the stomach and bowel. If her liver function does fail, then she will become dehydrated. ""She is doing fine,"" says the mother.

It is not clear if the children had been exposed to higher than normal levels of fluoride during their childhoods, or whether they drank bottled water instead of tap water. Poland has a strict fluoridation policy, where water companies must add extra fluoride into the supply every year in order to meet government standards. Most of the population drinks bottled water instead of tap water; only about 7 per cent rely on municipal water supplies for their primary source of drinking water.

There are also an assortment of developmental disabilities associated with ADHD as well as learning difficulties in autism spectrum disorder. It's important to note that while many people suffering from these disorders may not be suicidal, their conditions may increase one's risk for suicide in certain situations. These factors include: being in a relationship with someone who has a diagnosed mental disorder; having suicidal thoughts before you have ever had them; living alone; feeling isolated; being sexually abused as a child; experiencing extreme financial difficulties; and having a history of childhood trauma such as neglect and physical abuse. Suicide prevention organizations such as Samaritans provide support services and resources to help those affected by mental illnesses feel more comfortable discussing their concerns with others, and to provide a safe environment where they can seek help. They also work to create more supportive environments within the communities they serve. For information about suicide prevention and how to get involved, visit www.samaritans.org.

Q: When and why was suicide considered an epidemic?\nA: Historically, suicide was a taboo subject in our society. In fact, until recently no one talked openly about it except in cases of homicide. However, now there are more than 2 million suicides each year worldwide, and this number continues to grow. According to WHO statistics, approximately 65% of all deaths caused by violence occur among people aged between 15 and 44 years old. In 2007, according to UN data, 20.8 million people died due to HIV infection. In addition, there were approximately 1 billion individuals around the world living with dementia at the end of 2010. Furthermore, there are over 100 million chronic diseases and disability in the developing world. With so much going on, it might seem difficult to fathom just how devastating suicide is and yet, people still choose to take their own lives.

We're also looking for specific areas where there may be an imbalance within the body as well as other causes such as stress. And then we try to support those things using natural methods and therapies that are proven to work. For example, I have been practicing holistic massage, which involves massaging the entire body rather than focusing on specific parts such as the head or shoulders, etc. This helps to get the full effect from all the different techniques used, including acupuncture. Another area where we think that traditional Chinese medicine can really help us is with digestive issues like irritable bowel syndrome. But also, we can use herbal remedies such as ginseng and ginger to reduce anxiety and depression. We feel that since traditional Chinese medicine has always focused on preventing illness, it's a good place to start because you don't want to make any lifestyle changes until your body is healthy enough to do so. \nB: Why should people who choose this type of practice give their money to you and your organization, The Golden Lily Foundation?\r

\nA: Our aim is to raise awareness about the value of health care, but we also want everyone to have access to high-quality health care. It's very important to me that women understand the importance of taking control over their own reproductive organs, and that they know how to take care of themselves when they become pregnant, even if it means going without routine checkups or contraception for many months during pregnancy. That's why my foundation focuses on educating women about the benefits of fertility awareness methods, including the use of acupuncture and herbs, as well as counseling them on how to find their ideal birth plan. In addition, we teach couples how to communicate effectively about their choices by using the tools they already possess -- namely communication skills. By communicating honestly and openly with each other, these couples can realize their best chance at success is to be together through natural family planning.

Q: BPD or NOS?\nBPD is an acute emotional disturbance characterized by a pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, alternating between extremes of idealization (inflamed self-esteem) and devaluation (despair). The major symptom for BPD is the presence of at least three of the following:

• Involvement in multiple dysfunctional relationships.

• Use of aggression to resolve interpersonal conflicts.

• Impulsivity.

• Irritability and anger problems.

• Psychoticism.

• An inability to tolerate frustration.

• A history of childhood sexual abuse or trauma.

• Inappropriate, intense feelings of guilt, shame or worthlessness.

• Suicidal thoughts or behavior.

• Affective instability due to mood swings.

• Behavioral inhibition.

In addition, some people with BPD are hypersensitive to rejection and have difficulty tolerating criticism and may be extremely jealous and possessive of those close to them. Others may develop delusional beliefs about being victimized or abused. If these individuals become severely depressed, they will resort to self-mutilation, self-harm, or other self-destructive behaviors, such as drug use and suicide attempts. They also often act aggressively toward others. Because of their impulsiveness, antisocial behavior and tendency to engage in destructive behaviors, they frequently engage in criminal activities such as shoplifting, petty theft, fraud, vandalism and violence. Also known as Borderline Personality Disorder (Borderline Personality Disorder)

Q: how can someone know if they may be suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder?

A: The symptoms that make you suspect that you may have BPD include:

Impulsive behavior

Feelings of emptiness

Difficulty controlling impulses

Feeling isolated from others

Suicidal thoughts or actions

Having frequent thoughts about death/suicide

Ego dysregulation

Dissociative identity disorder - feeling detached from your body

Psychosis

Mood swings that can last days, weeks, months, years

Q: How do you diagnose multiple sclerosis? A: That's a good question. We usually use several different tests to try and diagnose MS. The most reliable one is called the double-blind study [a study in which neither patient nor physician knows who has been given an experimental drug or placebo]. It allows us to compare patients with those on other treatment regimens without bias.

Q: Why did you decide against trying to treat people with multiple sclerosis by using steroids? A: With our previous research, we looked at whether there might be any beneficial effect of steroid injections for some patients with relapsing MS; however, this was not a study designed to specifically assess whether such therapy could alleviate symptoms. More recently, researchers from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society have done a very rigorous randomized controlled trial examining the potential benefits of a number of treatments (including drugs) to reduce disability in those with relapsing forms of MS. However, due to their small sample size, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about possible efficacy based upon these results alone. In addition, because many medications are available over the counter, many patients may already be taking them as well. Therefore, further studies should look into more extensive use of steroid medication in people with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Q: What is a relapse? A: At least 5 months after stopping a long-term steroid regimen, relapse can occur if the person has had a major flare up of illness. This may result from either an allergic reaction caused by the anti-inflammatory properties of steroids or increased sensitivity to a secondary infection. These flares could also represent immune system attack on the bone marrow cells responsible for producing new white blood cells in the body. During these flares, pain is severe and fluctuating. Sometimes the disease progresses rapidly into acute exacerbations of symptoms such as numbness, weakness and fatigue. Other symptoms include fever, facial edema, night sweats, weight loss, eye irritation, and malaise. This acute phase typically lasts 3 weeks and can last 1 month or longer depending on the severity of the episode. For many years, doctors didn't think it would ever happen to someone else after they stopped taking their steroid pills. But now they're seeing more and more people relapsing after stopping these pills. Q: What kind of side effects are associated with steroid withdrawal? A: Steroid withdrawal produces physical changes and possibly serious infections. Some of these side effects involve fever, headaches, skin rash, muscle ac",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-1.481475591659546,77,q,10,0.39086294416243655,424,10

Q: how do I know if my doctor is using a new drug?


A: If your doctor tells you he or she is switching to a new medication or supplement, ask for the new package insert. This will tell you what each medicine does, including how long it lasts (how long it takes to work) and how much it costs. Also check the label on all products. It's important to know which ones are safe to take, because some may not be.


The labels of many supplements can say they contain ingredients such as calcium, iron, vitamin D3, omega-3 fatty acids and zinc. But these can also have dangerous side effects. In particular, eating fish rich in DHA and EPA — known as oily fish — may reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. Fish oil pills, however, cannot provide this type of protection.


It's also important to understand what drugs work well together. For example, progesterone cream taken after surgery may help stop bleeding, but it won't prevent clotting. And some antibiotics don't work as well with each other than when used separately.

<Gag> oh, and the other thing is that I was just wondering if we can get a good image on it, but this will be too much work since there's no camera. The only way to see the whole thing would be to actually film the whole thing, which in itself is kind of pointless.


Anyway, thanks again everyone! There are a few things that I forgot to mention. One question though. Is it possible to put an optical filter through the lens?


Secondly, how do you know where to focus when the screen is so small? That may not be very important, but i like to have something around the screen for reference.


Thirdly, how do you compensate for the blurriness? It seems you should be able to move the camera back and forth to achieve some semblance of depth, but the quality of your footage depends heavily on the position of the subject. If you're trying to cover a large area with one shot then you need to make sure the subjects don't pop out or jump off the screen. In short, we're looking at a pretty complex setup here.


I'm also going to assume that you want to capture video of someone else filming their own face - how do you go about doing this without them knowing? You could simply try and hide your camera behind the person who has the face you're shooting (which would look even worse) or perhaps you'd like to take advantage of a little trick known as ""live view"". To use live view, hold down the shutter button until it automatically selects a different focal length. This way you can shoot the entire scene in front of the object you wish to record from. You might notice that in the picture above that the background in the foreground has moved slightly towards me because I've used the live view feature to adjust the focal length.",127,glasses for computer,-12.99745273590088,62,q,10,0.9393939393939394,325,2

gpt2-xl_68,"Symptoms that are associated with MS.Q: What is multiple sclerosis?A: Multiple sclerosis is a progressive disease which affects the central nervous system (CNS) and causes disability. It can affect any part of your body, including the arms, legs or eyes. People who have MS may also experience other problems, such as vision changes, muscle weakness, hearing loss, tremors and seizures.Q: How many people in the United States have MS?A: More than 4 million Americans have MS. It's the most common neurological disorder diagnosed among adults over 50 years old. Nearly half of all adults with MS will develop it by age 65, compared to about one-third who get it before they turn 50. This means that nearly 1 out of every 5 adults with MS will be alive during their lifetime. Q: How does MS spread?A: The main way MS spreads is through the bloodstream when infected cells trigger inflammation in the brain and spinal cord. Because MS is so rare and hard to diagnose, there is currently no cure for it. But it can be managed with medication and physical therapy. There is no evidence that MS is transmitted by blood transfusion, but experts say the risk increases if you are at high risk for certain infectious diseases or have had previous infections that can cause serious complications.Q: Are there drugs that treat MS?A: Scientists continue to search for new treatments. There are two medications that have been proven effective against symptoms of MS -- interferon beta and glatiramer acetate (Glatiramer). They work together in an important way -- each drug triggers the release of proteins called ""interleukin"" from white blood cells. These proteins help block immune responses to MS symptoms.Q: Is it possible to become disabled from having MS?A: Yes. In fact, researchers have found that 30 percent of people with MS are unable to carry out some activities without help. Other research indicates that up to 40 percent of people with MS will lose use of an arm or leg because their muscles don't hold enough force. While it isn't clear whether this happens due to poor control of MS symptoms or underlying health conditions, it can make daily life more difficult.Q: Do I need to see my doctor if I want treatment for MS?A: If you're thinking about trying to stop or slow down the progression of MS or other conditions, talk to your primary care physician or neurologist. Your doctor will answer questions about how much MS treatment might be right for you. They'll also offer",68,List of multiple sclerosis symptoms,-2.191013813018799,18,q,10,0.08144796380090498,421,16

2. Which is the best way to assess cognitive decline in people with MS?

The most common method for assessing cognitive function in people who have MS is a standardized neuropsychological test that measures memory and other thinking skills (1). The test consists of 30 questions on which you need to select answers correctly. The test can be given at different times during a person's course of MS and may be repeated after several months or years (2).

If you are concerned about your ability to learn new information in the short term, this type of test might not give you an accurate view of your overall functioning. If you do not score well on the test, you will need to take another assessment to evaluate how well you are developing language and speech abilities over time. This evaluation should include additional tests that measure problems such as attention, learning and problem solving ability. However, it is important to note that many factors can affect cognition, including age, treatment options, genetic susceptibility, medical condition, medication use and the environment (3).

In addition to a standard neuropsychological test, there are several tests that you can purchase online or from your doctor to monitor your progress. These can also help evaluate changes in your symptoms. Examples of available testing include:

• Neurocognitive Assessment Tool (NCT) by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

This tool assesses the ability of patients with multiple sclerosis to make decisions and interact in social situations.

• Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). This test helps determine whether individuals have mild cognitive impairment. It has been recommended for diagnosing mild cognitive impairment in people with MS.

• Functional Cognitive Activity Test (FCAT). This is an adapted version of the FCAT used by doctors in the United Kingdom.

You can review these tools on your own or ask a neurologist or psychologist to evaluate them. They may offer more specific instructions regarding when and where to administer each test and what scores to report.

gpt2-xl_93,"In the short term, patients with MS have increased daytime sleepiness. This may lead to problems at work or school because they miss appointments, go out too late for class, etc. Sleep disorders are a common problem in patients with MS. However, over time, this worsens their symptoms, especially when combined with fatigue, depression, or cognitive impairments (such as memory loss). They often have trouble getting up in the morning due to reduced muscle strength and mobility. It is not uncommon that some patients with MS report experiencing fatigue after every meal. These can be a source of stress, and it's important to make sure you're taking enough rest during your day to prevent any issues from developing. A good balance between light activity and activity will help ease these symptoms. \r

\t Q: Why is the Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) on the new vaccines not being released to the public?\nA: Because of ""the potential impact"" on people who get the shots, the National Institutes of Health said. \r

\t \nHow can parents know if their child may be at risk for contracting a disease from the vaccines?\r

\tThe CDC says it cannot release that information without a court order and because of ongoing litigation.\r

\tThe government has refused to publicly disclose many other important details about the vaccines. For example, the FDA has refused to say what will happen to the live viruses after they are injected into humans -- something some experts have called crucial. In fact, many vaccine critics say the vaccines are unsafe.\r

\tWhat does this mean for children who receive these vaccines in the future? The federal agency that approves them, the Food and Drug Administration, says it won't provide any safety data or even allow independent scientists to study the effects of the vaccines. And since most medical researchers are reluctant to conduct studies on vaccines given to young children, there may never be any long-term followup studies. The only way to learn whether the vaccine causes cancer in later life could be by testing the vaccine on animals or through genealogy research.\r

\tWhy do people think vaccines cause autism when the evidence is so flimsy? According to some experts, the increased rates of autism were largely caused by the overuse of antibiotics, which destroy certain bacteria that produce toxins known as neurocarcinogens. That's why the Centers for Disease Control recommended against using penicillin in infants because it destroys beneficial strains of bacteria. The CDC also warned doctors not to give babies penicillin unless the doctor was sure no other medicine had been prescribed before it. The same precaution should apply to children whose mothers took antibiotics before pregnancy.\r

\t What role did vaccines play in the spread of measles during the 1980s? One theory suggests that the first outbreak occurred when unvaccinated children were brought to clinics that treated patients with AIDS. A second theory holds that when the virus mutated into a form that was more contagious, it went airborne and infected others.\r

If there is any overlap in coverage between your children's and parent's plans, that will be considered a qualifying event for you. However, if you have more than one child and more than one of them has a qualifying event under your plan, only one of your children will qualify as having received an exemption from group health insurance. The coverage must be medically necessary and in the form of a qualified long-term care or retirement benefit plan. It cannot be part of a group health insurance plan that provides medical coverage without a financial requirement (for example, health maintenance organization). This rule applies even though these types of plans do not include requirements for preventive services.\u00a0You may also wish to review our policy on providing extra help for relatives who need it.

Q: What happens if my spouse's income exceeds my income by $2,000 and we file jointly?\nA: Under the Internal Revenue Code and regulations, joint returns are treated as married filing separately for tax purposes. If you and your spouse file jointly, then you are both subject to the same taxes. Your combined taxable income after all deductions and exemptions would be $9,250 ($7,500 + $3,750).\r

If either of you make too much money ($6,350 or less) to meet this threshold, you'll pay higher income tax rates -- up to 39.6% percent on joint filers earning more than $150,000 ($75,800 per person/$225,100 per couple). If either of you makes too little to satisfy this threshold, you won't owe additional federal income taxes at all. So, whether or not you have joint tax liability, you're still responsible for paying at least some of your share of both state and federal taxes if each spouse contributes to his or her own retirement account. This includes Social Security payments and unemployment benefits. If you don't want to contribute to a retirement account directly, you could elect to defer those contributions until retirement. You could also transfer assets from your regular retirement accounts into a Roth IRA, but doing so requires a lengthy and complicated process. Once you've done these things, you won't have any federal tax consequences for years to come unless you choose to file a return claiming a break for marital status (see question #",79,Can I pass multiple sclerosis to other family members?,-11.691390991210938,162,q,10,0.7074235807860262,417,13

Cognitive Functioning Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis \u2013 Multiple Sclerosis: Causes and Treatment Q: How does this disease impact cognitive function? A: Cognitive impairment can occur even when a person has no signs or symptoms. In fact, up to 75% of patients with MS will show evidence of cognitive dysfunction over time. Q: Can you think clearly after having MS? A: MS is a progressive neurological disorder affecting nerve cells throughout the body. Many doctors believe that MS causes changes in the way the brain processes sensory information, leading to difficulties focusing attention and making decisions. People with MS often struggle with memory problems, difficulty concentrating, lack of motivation, anxiety and depression. Some of these symptoms improve with treatment, especially for those who have milder forms of MS. Q: How do I know which form of MS I have? A: Most people with MS first get diagnosed as RRMS, a subtype that affects young adults. More than half of people with RRMS eventually develop relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Some people with MS don't get any warning signs until later in life; however, many people have symptoms before their 50s or 60s. Symptoms can range from poor eye vision or balance problems, trouble walking, trouble speaking or understanding speech, slow reflexes and seizures, to weakness in one arm or leg, numbness or tingling in another part of the body, or paralysis of a limb or arms. There are other types of MS that affect different parts of the body, and many have similar symptoms. When people first start to notice problems, doctors ask them to complete a questionnaire called the MS Self Assessment Questionnaire (MS-SAQ) to help determine whether MS",58,Risk to develop multiple sclerosis,-7.162674903869629,50,q,10,0.21645021645021645,393,11

1) The following medications have been reported to cause allergic reactions in children and adults: aminoglycosides, antibiotics, antifungals, azathioprine (an allergy medicine), barbiturates, carbamazepine (a seizure medication), cholestyramine (for a sleep disorder), clonidine (for an eye infection or inflammation), dapsone (used for fever-related problems), diphenhydramine (pain reliever), diethylpropion, fluphenazine (antihistamine), hydroxyzine, isoniazide (sleep aid), ketoconazole (antifungal), levetiracetam (muscle relaxer), meclizine (chronic insomnia drug), nimodipine, phenytoin (diet pill), rifampicin (rheumatoid arthritis medication), selegiline (diuretic used to treat hypertension), tricyclics (blood pressure pills), tetracyclines, and steroids (medications for osteoporosis). There are many possible side effects of these medications. It is important that you discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor before taking any of them.

2) For people using some of these medications as part of their treatment for asthma, there has been a report of a worsening of symptoms when they stop using these drugs. This may be due to a change in the chemicals that are now being metabolized by the liver. Therefore, it would be best to continue the treatment as prescribed unless symptoms worsen. If symptoms do not improve after a few days of stopping one or more of these medications, then it could be time to discontinue the use of this class of medications altogether.

3) A study published in 2006 showed that adding calcium to aspirin reduced the risk of severe heart attack in middle age men who had already developed high blood pressure. However, no such benefit was observed among women or younger patients; rather, the addition of calcium increased the likelihood of experiencing a serious adverse event related to high blood pressure. Some researchers suggest that low doses of vitamin D may reduce the impact of aspirin on cardiovascular health in older individuals and should therefore not be used routinely.

Fibromyalgia also affects some areas of the brain. The main complaint of fibro patients are generalized or localized pain with no obvious cause. FMS has been found in more than 200 different ethnicities. Patients have reported having joint aches, low back pain, menstrual problems such as amenorrhea (no periods), urinary tract infections, and skin rashes. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, but they tend to be worse on the right side of the body (i.e., the ""right side"" of their body). Some symptoms are transient; others persist for months or years.

Mental Symptoms/Abnormal Behaviors

Although there are many types of mental disorders that may affect people with FM, certain common symptoms are listed below.

1. Depersonalization - This condition includes feelings of unreality, detachment, disassociation from reality, detachment from emotions, or feeling detached from yourself. These sensations seem to occur when you are not thinking about something and are unrelated to any particular external event or situation. Examples include being unable to recognize your own name or what it means to be ""in the moment."" Other effects include being able to forget how you got into bed and forgetting where you were last night. In general these feelings do not lead to overt behavior which would need professional help. However, some people with depersonalization experience difficulty sleeping, nausea, vomiting, or emotional lability.

2. Hallucinations - Sometimes people will see things that aren't actually there. For example, someone may think he or she sees a person's face move before realising this is just an image projected by his or her mind onto a wall. Hallucinations may be visual, auditory, tactile, taste, smell, touch, or other forms. They are often confused with illusions or delusions and can present themselves differently depending upon who is experiencing them at the time.

3. Somatic Symptoms - These symptoms may appear similar to those of schizophrenia or delusional disorder and may consist of somatic complaints like unexplained muscle stiffness, loss of strength, or trouble walking. There are various causes of these pains. They could stem from physical damage to nerves due to diabetes, infection, inflammation, or injury, stress, hormonal imbalances, or abnormal sleep patterns or activity levels.

\nC: Diabetes can be managed through diet and exercise. (Source)

Dr. Mervin Smith, a former professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, is an expert on metabolic syndrome, the condition that leads to Type 2 diabetes. He has been in the field for more than 30 years, and says we are living in the Golden Age of obesity.

""In our lifetimes, almost every single person will be obese. We've got this huge population with huge health problems because of obesity. The numbers of people dying from heart disease have dropped by 50 percent since 1980,"" he said. ""But if you look at deaths from diseases associated with excess weight, those numbers have skyrocketed.""

For example, there were about 1 million deaths each year from cancer related to obesity in 2010. And one-third of adults now have some form of chronic or acute kidney disease, which Dr. Smith said is just as deadly as Type 2 diabetes.

He also noted that the rise in childhood obesity rates is far greater than what is being observed in adults.

""There's not much change in children -- they're getting fatter in adolescence. But their adult size hasn't changed very much,"" he said.

Questionnaire for Menopausal Hormone Therapy–Women's Health Program

In this questionnaire menopause symptoms were assessed as described above. The questionnaire also included questions about the following: history of previous vasectomy; age at which first had a vasectomy; how often vasectomy was performed and why; and whether the procedure was done before or after menopause. For each participant, all vasectomy-related questionnaires were reviewed by two physicians who had no financial interest in the study. Questionnaires were returned to us in February 2003, and data collection was completed by March 2004. This paper reports results from the overall survey. In addition, we analyzed four subgroups of participants with a median age of 64 years on the basis of whether they had received hormone therapy and the year of first treatment with hormones. Of these women, 75% did not report an indication for hormonal contraception prior to undergoing their vasectomy. All other groups were divided into three groups based on duration of use of hormones during their lifetime and type of contraceptive method used. Women who reported taking oral contraceptives, long-acting reversible contraception pills (LARCs), intrauterine devices (IUDs), implants, injectables, transdermal patches, vaginal rings, microgels, vaginal ring implants, vaginal suppositories, female condoms, male condoms, spermicide and hormonal IUDs were considered to be postmenopausal, whereas women using hormonal IUDs and injecting methods such as implants, microgels, and vaginal ring implants were considered to be premenopausal.

The study, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, found that those who were more likely to be prescribed a higher dose of antibiotics had an increased risk for developing diabetes. The effect was even stronger among people with diabetes and other health problems.

How is hypothyroidism diagnosed?

Hypothyroidism is usually discovered during a routine medical checkup. If the thyroid function tests normal, it's possible that an underactive thyroid gland caused your symptoms, according to the Mayo Clinic. Your physician will do blood work and perform other tests to find out what's causing your symptoms.

How is hypothyroidism treated?

When symptoms develop, treating them with medication can prevent permanent damage to your body. Doctors may prescribe medications such as levothyroxine (also called T4), lithium, thiazide diuretics and bromocriptine to treat symptoms related to low levels of thyroid hormones. They also may recommend dietary changes, including reduced intake of fat and cholesterol.

Treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism begins when patients begin treatment with their thyroid hormone replacement therapy. It often takes several months before symptoms begin to improve.

What are the treatments available for relapsing MS and can they help with pain?

This is because there's been some evidence that using adjuvants (chemicals added to vaccines) can interfere with how well the immune system attacks tumors during a person's lifetime.

What is a Multiple Sclerosis Work Study?

A Multiple Sclerosis work study involves working at home, either as an active participant or a co-recipient (a person who helps others by doing tasks such as grocery shopping, housekeeping, cooking, cleaning etc.). The main purpose of the program is to help individuals with MS gain independence and confidence to do everyday things that were previously beyond their capability. In addition, it provides participants with job training and skills development opportunities. It also allows the individual to learn about new ways of living and being productive in order to improve his/her overall quality of life.

gpt2-xl_1,"In a healthy, free-ranging animal, there is little or no effect on other animals. That's why it's not possible to breed for health purposes. But what happens when the human and animal populations get mixed up with each other? How will the population of humans affect the environment in which the animal lives? It's called ""population mixing"". The key factor to consider here is the amount of genetic diversity between the two groups. If two different species are allowed to interbreed, the resulting offspring will only differ from one another by the small differences of their DNA – that's how they can be considered identical twins (see ""What is a twin?"", above). However, if the breeding process has been done correctly, these children will be completely genetically similar: just like their parents. This means that even though some may still look different from one another, these differences won't mean anything. A person with diabetes might become obese due to certain genes he or she possesses, but his or her blood sugar levels remain normal. Similarly, an elderly person who doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables won't cause any harm to the plant life around them because those plants don't produce insulin. Thus, we've seen that genetic differences between people can't lead to disease, since most genetic traits that affect health occur naturally.

But what about conditions such as cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, obesity, or Type 2 Diabetes? Are they caused by genes that come from our ancestors and therefore not inherited, as is the case with us? They're not. There exist genes that play a role in making certain types of cancers develop or predispose to them; however, many genes have no bearing on cancer. In contrast, there are genes that make us prone to heart disease, depression, anxiety disorders, epilepsy, etc., all of which are inherited conditions. These conditions were created by a combination of environmental factors and genes. So although some diseases are hereditary and others environmental, we cannot say they are caused by genes passed down through generations. We must always go back to the question of ""How did the people living at that time live?"" We also see this in diseases in general. For example, the idea that smoking causes lung cancer is not supported by science; rather, smoking causes unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as poor diet, high cholesterol levels, stress, etc. Therefore, smoking is probably an environmental factor in itself. On the other hand, it would be very difficult to determine whether cigarettes had something to do with someone getting lung cancer;",1,What are the most common chronic diseases?

gpt2-xl_35,"Some say the reason ketogenic diets work so well is that they reduce insulin resistance. This means your body has to produce less of it, and therefore you use less glucose when you eat. The more glucose you consume when you eat, the higher your blood sugar will be and also your risk of developing diabetes. So if you are struggling with high blood sugars, try switching to a low-carb or paleo diet which cuts out carbs but keeps protein and fat in your diet!

Doesn't eating too much protein cause weight gain?

Most studies show no connection between an increase in dietary protein intake (in either grams or calories) and weight gain. But some people do report feeling 'hungry' after consuming a lot of food – even though their normal calorie needs have been met. If you experience hunger, you should aim to keep your daily calorie intake lower than usual to avoid overeating.

Don't worry if you're not used to counting calories, as this can be done on a smartphone app called MyFitnessPal. Just enter how many calories you ate each day and you'll know exactly what you've eaten and how much more you need to maintain your current weight. You can choose from different types of meals such as breakfast, lunch and dinner. It's great to see other health blogs using the same approach!

What about eggs and dairy products?

Eggs and dairy products aren't recommended because of concerns over saturated fatty acid intakes and cholesterol levels. In fact, there's evidence suggesting these foods might actually raise total cholesterol rather than decrease them. So if you're looking at cutting down on eggs, take heart: there's no proven link between egg consumption and cardiovascular disease. And contrary to popular belief, most doctors now think the risks associated with eating cheese outweigh those of eggs. So eat up if you want to stick to a healthy, balanced diet, but don't let any of those fears stop you!

Is all low carb really the same? How does one go about getting started?

You may get confused when reading various low carbohydrate diets. There's no single right way to eat a low carb diet – in fact many people find a ketogenic or very low carbohydrate diet works best for them. It depends on several factors including your personal metabolism and goals. For example, someone who wants to lose fat may benefit from eating more carbohydrates, whereas someone who doesn't mind gaining muscle mass would probably feel better going a little heavier on the protein side.

In addition, exercise can be a cost-effective way to improve quality of life in older adults. For example, an evaluation of physical fitness programs for people 65 years or older reported that participants who participated in three 30 min daily sessions at their homes were more likely to report increased healthful behaviors than those who only attended two weekly group training sessions with one session every month [8].

For some older adults, it may be possible to decrease the risk of falls by taking steps to prevent them. As part of our study, we examined whether regular walking significantly reduced the incidence of falls among individuals aged ≥65 years, regardless of how much they exercised or what type of home physical activity intervention was used.

Materials and methods The Canadian Community Health Survey 2008 is a household survey conducted by Statistics Canada from July 1st 2007 through June 30th 2009. All households completed the questionnaire, which included questions on demographics such as age, sex, residence, income and education, but not about lifestyle or medical conditions. There was no requirement for participation in this survey: it was available free of charge online via Statistics Canada's Internet website. However, all respondents agreed to participate. We used data obtained from all households in the City of Toronto and the suburbs of Mississauga and Brampton between May 2nd 2010 and October 22nd 2011. This analysis involved 18,000 interviews with 5,200 men and women aged ≥65 years who lived alone or had someone living in their house. Study design and participants To estimate the association between self-reported leisure time activity (LTPA), measured using the Physical Activity Scale for Older Adults [13], and the risk of falling in elderly Canadians over a 10 year period, we compared falls observed during the follow up with those expected based on previous surveys. It has been widely recognized that falls are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older persons, accounting for approximately half of all injuries and resulting in serious disability in >60% of cases [14–16] and costing US$6 billion annually [17,18]. Over the past 20 years, several prospective cohort studies have suggested that regular low intensity physical activity (LTIPA), typically defined as any physical activity lasting <3 h/week, is associated with lower odds of all-cause mortality and morbidity [19–23].

In phase III studies, results have shown the benefit of using immunotherapy. There are many reasons why immunotherapy may be beneficial—including improving survival rate (in the case of interferon beta-1a), reducing inflammation (cyclophosphamide), and strengthening the brain's ability to repair itself (rituximab)—but researchers still need to understand exactly how these therapies work so they can develop them further.

So I gave this a go. The first thing I noticed about this product was the smell...not something I like in a cosmetic item. But as soon as I touched the product it was very moisturising, soothing and very light weight which made my skin feel very comfortable. Although it does clog pores I can easily wipe them away with lukewarm water while applying makeup. After using it for a week I'm still happy with it because its very light weight, easy to apply and doesn't leave an oily film. All in all I'll continue to buy this because I think it might be a little expensive compared to other similar moisturisers but I do recommend it because it's an excellent value for money.

There are many possible causes of preterm birth. The list below includes some examples of more common conditions associated with preterm labor:

Obstetric problems such as large-for-gestational-age babies or multiple pregnancies.

Preeclampsia.

Miscarriages.

Low blood pressure during pregnancy.

Diabetes.

Hypothyroidism.

Congenital anomalies, genetic mutations, chromosomal abnormalities, or other life factors that may increase the risk of having a premature baby.

Preventing Premature Birth and Other Problems Related to Pregnancy

Women who become pregnant are at increased risk for several medical conditions related to their pregnancy. These include:

Premature birth. Most research has shown an association between low birth weight and prematurity (2,3). This is especially true if the mother smokes while pregnant. If you smoke or drink alcohol while pregnant, talk to your health care provider about quitting or limiting these substances. Smoking can cause your placenta and organs to develop abnormally, which increases the chance that your baby will be born prematurely. It also contributes to a higher risk of complications such as high blood pressure and heart disease in both you and your child. While not all women experience symptoms of prematurity due to smoking or drinking, it's important that you speak with your doctor before you begin this program so he or she can help identify any preterm birth risks.

gpt2-xl_63,"MS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease which affects the central nervous system. It's characterised by inflammation and tissue destruction of the nerve cells that control voluntary movement, called neurons, causing damage to their outer membrane and leading to loss of motor skills, including walking, speaking, swallowing, chewing, vision, balance and hearing. MS affects 1 in 100 people over the age of 50 but can be diagnosed much earlier if symptoms occur.

People with MS are also more likely to experience a range of other health problems, such as depression or anxiety; heart attack; stroke; blood clots; and peripheral vascular disease (such as high blood pressure). They may have trouble sleeping, and sometimes forget things.

Most doctors now recommend that people with MS get a two-week course of steroid medication before they start work on their own. This will reduce muscle weakness and prevent further progression, which means you're less likely to lose your job.


How common is MS?

The exact number of people affected by MS varies according to country – it was estimated at 8 million people worldwide in 2011, up from 6 million in 1990. Around 40% of adults have had an episode of MS, usually one or more times in their life. People who don't develop MS are referred to as 'persisters'. The average time between first appearance of MS symptoms and diagnosis is about 10 years.


What causes MS?

Scientists do not know exactly why some people develop MS while others don't. However, research suggests that there could be genetic factors involved, or environmental triggers, both of which could lead to the development of MS in those genetically predisposed to the condition.

It has been suggested that MS could be caused by an autoimmune process triggered when something enters the body through the nose or mouth. In this case, inflammation occurs because the immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues. These may include nerves or muscles, or both.


Is there any treatment for MS?

Some people take steroids to stop them developing symptoms, and others avoid exposure to ultraviolet radiation or air pollution. Some people receive stem cell injections into damaged parts of their brain to stimulate production of new nerve cells. But these treatments aren't yet proven effective for all cases of MS.

For many people who develop MS after a severe injury or illness, standard medical care isn't enough to help them get better. The aim is to keep people safe and continue taking medications until the symptoms improve. This could mean a person stops working for",63,Will multiple sclerosis affect my career?,-0.3404601514339447,8,no_prompt,1,0.032,423,1

According to the new study, published online August 21 in Nature Medicine, ""exposure to low levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has a positive effect on human immune cells.""

The researchers found that PAHs are formed by humans as they breathe out carbon dioxide and burn it up during respiration. The researchers also believe there is evidence that certain types of PAHs have beneficial health effects on immune function, particularly those with antioxidant properties known as quinones.

""We believe our results could lead to novel strategies for developing safer alternatives for cleaning air pollution,"" said study coauthor Dr. Elanor Fuchs, professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health and director of the Center for Environmental Toxicology at the school's Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""Our findings provide an important step toward understanding whether these chemicals can impact the immune system.""

In recent years, PAH exposure from fossil fuels has increased rapidly due to emissions from cars, trucks and power plants. Researchers say this increase in PAH emissions may be responsible for increasing rates of childhood asthma and other diseases, including cancer. Additionally, scientists suspect PAHs may contribute to the development of MS and Parkinson's disease. Other studies suggest that PAHs like benzene, which is primarily produced from fossil fuel combustion, are associated with impaired lung function and lower birth weight.

Researchers collected blood samples from two groups: one group was exposed to high concentrations of diesel exhaust pollutants and another to particulate matter such as soot and dirt. The study used a technique called ""radioligand immunoassay,"" or RIA, which is widely used to measure PAH activity in blood. They measured the amount of PAHs present in the samples using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).

They found that children who had higher amounts of PAHs in their systems were less likely to develop allergic rhinitis – inflammation of the airways caused by allergies. This finding suggests that PAHs may help protect against airway inflammation, possibly via mechanisms similar to some other antioxidants, according to the researchers.

Additionally, they found that both PAHs and particle matter were associated with lower numbers of Treg cells – immune cells that regulate your response to bacteria, viruses and other pathogens. In addition, they identified a gene in Treg cells involved in suppressing inflammatory responses. However, these results should not necessarily affect",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-10.16171646118164,71,no_prompt,1,0.3480392156862745,391,1
gpt2-xl_54,"What are the treatments available?

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease. The body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues and cells, causing a wide variety of symptoms: problems with movement, vision, hearing, balance, memory and speech. MS affects about 1% to 5% of adults in the United States and can affect anyone at any age, including children.

The cause of MS remains unclear. But research shows that both genetic and environmental factors play roles. One important factor may be inflammation caused by the body's reaction to a protein called complement components called C3, which help protect against infection and other diseases. In addition to genetic predisposition, some people have more C3 in their blood than others, making them more vulnerable to developing MS.

In most cases, however, MS cannot be diagnosed until you have been diagnosed as having had one or more of many possible manifestations – including numbness and tingling, muscle weakness or spasms, loss of consciousness or even death. For those who do develop MS, doctors use medical tests, imaging studies, laboratory studies and medications to diagnose the disease.

You'll probably get tested for MS if you're 50 years old, have a high-risk family history and/or have other risk factors such as obesity, diabetes or smoking. If your doctor suspects your condition is MS, he or she will refer you for additional testing as part of a multidisciplinary approach aimed at discovering why MS develops and what treatment options might work best for you.",54,What does multiple sclerosis diagnosis include?

A lot of people who are involved in the treatment field have found that being able to identify a person's triggers is really important. For example, there are some people who will be triggered by anything with blood or gore. Other people might find themselves triggered by things like pictures of violent situations or other disturbing images. Another common trigger might be sounds that are extremely loud, like if you were to hear someone screaming while they're having a heart attack in front of you. They often want to stay away from certain places because those locations can trigger their anxiety and even cause them distress.

One of my biggest concerns when I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder was the fear that it would affect how others perceive me as a result of this disorder. This seems especially true for younger patients, as many people under the age of 30 suffer from BPD in addition to their mental health issues. As a result of this, many young people will see this diagnosis as an obstacle rather than something that can help them progress through life. It's also interesting to note that many young people go through years of intense therapy without ever understanding what causes these types of feelings.

– TSH levels may be elevated to normal or high.

– Thyroid antibodies (T 4 and T 3 ) may be elevated in the blood.

– Elevated concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) are observed, which indicates that TSH is being released from the pituitary gland. This can indicate low T4 and T3 serum levels.

Symptoms of subclinical hyperthyroidism include:

– Fatigue

– Cognitive impairment

– Increased appetite

– Decreased energy

– Seizures

Low TSH – Can be a sign of Graves' disease if the thyroid is not functioning normally. The diagnosis of Graves' disease is based on the presence of at least three of the following symptoms:

1) Throat clearing nodules/segmental hyperplasia

2) Hypercalcemia (a decrease in the calcium level within the cells)

3) Weight loss

4) Abnormalities in renal function including decreased urine output

5) Atrial fibrillation

The other benefit of using wireless technology is that it eliminates cable clutter and wires in your home or office. If you want to use a wired keyboard and mouse, just purchase one and keep it around for the rest of your life! Also note that you can still plug a USB flash drive into any keyboard/mouse and connect it directly to the computer without needing a separate cable. This means that you don't need to remove your old mice when moving from laptop to desktop and vice versa. I've even had laptops where both keyboards were connected to the same hub with little or no effort required. You should be able to get away with this setup on most computers but if not, check your manufacturer's documentation.

Why Wireless?

There are a lot of benefits associated with having wireless technology available for your computers. There's the obvious ""you'll never lose"" factor as well as the fact that if someone does somehow manage to hack into your network (which they won't), then all their data is gone. Another reason that wireless has been gaining popularity over wired solutions is because it allows for better battery life. The first time you use your new wireless mouse and keyboard you might find that after an hour or so of continuous use, your batteries are going flat and you're looking at another 30 minutes before you can start working again. Of course, there are also times when you may find yourself traveling somewhere or your network might get congested and require a power outage. In these situations, having to buy a new battery or replacing the entire keyboard and mouse unit could quickly add up to more than the cost of what you purchased. With wireless technology, once your equipment is turned back on you can continue using it even though the computer itself is completely dead.

A few weeks ago we decided that our last resort was to take our laptops everywhere we went. Unfortunately, this meant having to give them out to family members or friends who didn't live near us. To combat this issue we bought two cheap wireless mice that were rated for approximately 8 hours of continuous use. We figured we'd try them out during our travels so that we wouldn't run out of batteries mid-trip. Since we live in a small town in Texas, there aren't too many people who bring their own portable devices with them on vacation which makes carrying a full sized laptop with us impractical.

In summary, there are several hypotheses about what contributes to this phenomenon; however, there are no easy answers as yet. A key question that remains unresolved is why certain individuals experience a higher incidence of fatigue than others (and for whom it becomes worse over time). The hypothesis that fatigue in MS can stem from an impaired ability to regulate energy homeostasis has attracted significant attention over the past decade. However, this notion remains controversial. We suggest that we need to rethink how we define and assess fatigue as a risk factor for developing disease. Instead, our current thinking should focus on its importance when symptoms occur, and whether or not an individual's overall health status plays a role in their likelihood of experiencing a worsening of fatigue after illness onset. This will help us identify those at greatest risk and develop better treatments.

Nivolumab is not approved for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia or other solid tumors (including nonmelanoma skin cancers).

In June 2018, the FDA granted Nivolumab accelerated approval to treat patients with advanced multiple sclerosis and also requested that a Phase 3 study be initiated in early 2019. The trial will evaluate safety and tolerability of Nivolumab as an add-on therapy, rather than its sole active ingredient. In addition, the agency asked for additional information on the efficacy and safety profile of the drug following an interim analysis of data from the ongoing NIAID Study No. 823.

Trial Design

The pivotal Phase 2a/2b study will enroll approximately 1,500 patients who have failed previous treatments with at least one agent approved by the FDA for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, including relapses, exacerbations, or disability after completion of standard anti-inflammatory therapies. All participants must meet ICD 10 criteria for probable or definite MS. Participants are randomly assigned to receive either placebo plus one dose of Nivolumab or Nivolumab plus four doses of interferon beta-1a or interferon beta-1b. All participants may undergo treatment with all four agents; however, only two months of treatment are required after enrollment. Patients will need a baseline MS evaluation before randomization. Follow-up visits will occur every 6 weeks until week 24 of treatment. At each visit, the study team will assess quality of life, cognition, fatigue, symptoms, pain, and MRI scans. Additional information about the design and conduct of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is described below in ""Study Details.""

gpt2-xl_72,"Covid (daclizumab) is a new treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The drug is taken once every 4 weeks to treat the disease and prevent relapse. There are no long term studies on the safety or effectiveness of this type of medication in patients taking anti-rejection medications, such as interferon beta-1a (IFN-beta), that can make the immune system attack healthy cells in your body, known as autoimmunity.


There have been some reports of an increase in cases of blood clots after receiving the first dose of the drug in children and young adults who were being treated with IFN-alpha, a commonly used antibody that triggers an immune response against MS lesions. However, these clots did not appear to be related to the patient's risk factors for developing blood clotting like age or diabetes.


The FDA has asked manufacturers to submit reports on the safety of use of the drug in people who also take other immunosuppressive drugs. This could include drugs such as prednisone and cyclophosphamide (used to reduce inflammation in the joints).


How does the flu shot work? What should I expect from it?

It protects you against certain strains of influenza viruses, which usually cause more serious illness than seasonal flu. It is recommended every year by health authorities around the world to get vaccinated because flu can spread quickly during the winter months when many people are ill or unable to sleep.


You may experience mild symptoms, including fever, headache, muscle aches, nausea and vomiting, but most people don't feel sick at all. Symptoms last between 2 and 8 days. You will need to see a doctor if you start feeling very unwell. Flu season typically lasts from November 1st until April 30th each year.


What happens if I miss a vaccination?

If you missed one or more doses of the flu vaccine during 2015/2016, you may still receive another vaccine later in 2016/2017. If you didn't receive any vaccine within this period, you should contact your doctor and talk about whether your health problems are likely due to the virus. Your doctor may recommend more testing or a different type of vaccine, depending on what testing they do have available. For example, if you're allergic to eggs, you won't be able to get the H3N2 vaccine.

The authors report that a single dose of the drug, called PDE-5 inhibitors, significantly reduced both total and tumor burden in patients with newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer who were treated as part of an aggressive treatment protocol known as ""precision medicine."" These men received standard doses of chemotherapy plus an implantable device (called a DRE) which delivers a high concentration of PDE-5 inhibitors.

The investigators also studied the efficacy of PDE-5 inhibitors in treating men whose tumors had not yet reached clinical signs of metastasis. In these cases, the researchers administered a lower dose, between 10 to 20 micrograms per day, along with standard therapy for more than two months before switching to a higher dose. The results showed that these men no longer required PDE-5 inhibitors after their initial dose, indicating that PDE-5 inhibition might help reduce the number of distant metastases.

His first marriage was with a sister of his step-mother's family, who died shortly after her wedding; but he soon married Miss Sarah, daughter of Lord D'Aubigné, whose family were at this time in good standing. In 1781 he left Paris for Flanders, where he spent several years, until 1786, as governor of the department of Artois and Navarre; from which place he returned to England in 1805, on the death of his elder brother James, then living with his own family in London. But being obliged to leave London again upon the outbreak of the war between France and Prussia in 1806, he remained there until 1830, when he came back to Germany to take up his old post of minister at Schleswig-Holstein. At that period he was appointed by Frederick William I., Prince Elector of Hesse, Governor-General of all that portion of the Empire lying north of the Rhine and Danube Rivers. In January 1810 he resigned the office, because he wished to devote himself entirely to the promotion of art and science, taking no part in political affairs. He lived here till 1816, when he moved to Berne (1809), where he continued his labours from 1817 to 1832, while he also wrote extensively for various publications. As an artist, he is well known among artists throughout Europe, having made a profound impression in their eyes through his paintings. His chief works are portraits of eminent persons, and some landscapes and portraiture. On the whole, his interest lay in painting, but he became interested chiefly in natural history and botany, so much so that in 1833 he took a course in zoology at Vienna University, under Professor Böhme. He died at Berne in April 1837, aged eighty-six, leaving two sons, one of whom succeeded him, Charles Albert, Marquess of Königsberg, and another Louis Ferdinand, Duke of Alba (now King of Spain). Of Charles Albert, nothing more than his name has come down to us, although it may be doubted whether he ever actually existed. A son of Henry, Earl of Elgin, of the house of Marlborough (died July 12, 1861), he had been born October 20, 1775, in Leipzig.

Here are some of my favorites:

1) The ""Flatline"" Stretch

Stand with a towel or other bolster (like I do here) on your lap. Your legs should be straight and parallel to the floor. Turn one leg out over the foot of the chair so it's pointing up toward you. Straighten your torso and lower yourself into a stretch like this:

2) The Standing Pelvic Tilt

Standing up straight and holding onto something will help with balance when performing any forward bending exercise (like lunges). You're not going to be able to hold that pose for very long if you're using your legs for support. A lot of people who do yoga will perform pelvic tilts from standing; I've seen videos online where they're doing it standing up. This is an incredibly effective way to improve core strength because you have to actively stabilize your pelvis to keep it in place, which strengthens your abs and obliques. Here's how to do it:

3) Lying Knee-to-Knee Stretch

This stretches both sides of the quadriceps muscle — the muscles that run down each knee of your legs. To begin, lie flat on your back with your knees bent at 90 degrees. Slowly move your knees apart until your feet touch. Hold for 10 seconds. Repeat two more times. Then return to your starting position.

4) The Calf Raise

You may notice me saying ""calf raise."" But don't worry about hurting your calves, just focus on getting those hamstrings working again. Place your hands under your heels and slowly lift them off the ground. Make sure you stay neutral throughout by keeping your back flat and straight. Try to avoid arching your back too much. Do 3 sets of 8 reps.

5) Elbows Behind Neck Pulls

I love this one! It works all the major muscles of your forearms. I'll show you how to do it below:

6) Plank With Hands On Chest

It was the first thing my husband taught me to do every morning after our daily 5 a.m. yoga practice, and it still remains one of his favorite moves!

For each endpoint, we analyzed the data using Cox proportional hazards regression to compare the risk of death between patients with high versus low exposure to BPA from both time points. To account for potential reverse causality due to patients who developed lung cancer as a result of other non-occupational exposures (e.g., occupational chemicals), we performed a sensitivity analysis that included only those participants whose cumulative cumulative urinary concentrations were above the median value in our prior study [9].

The study population consisted of 566 men and women aged 50–79 years at baseline (mean age 55.5±8.0) enrolled during 1993 through 1997. Individuals who had been previously diagnosed with a solid tumor or multiple myeloma (n = 753; 49%) and who completed an oral biopsy before enrollment were excluded. In addition, we excluded individuals with self reported occupational chemical sensitivities, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, history of kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, thyroid disease, current smoking, and use of aspirin, beta blockers or antipsychotics within 30 days of urine collection. Participants who did not complete a follow up questionnaire were considered unexposed ( n = 1030 ). Of these, 1582 (44.6%) completed the interview and mailed back the final questionnaire. We also excluded individuals who withdrew from the trial, left the country, died or moved overseas. We further limited this group to participants who could provide information on their lifetime average level of BPA exposure based on self reported levels of urine BPA. Of these, 874 (48.7%) provided enough information to conduct the analyses.

In general, there are few published studies examining the association between long term exposure to BPA from dental fillings and subsequent lung cancer mortality. A recent prospective cohort study found no relationship between BPA exposure from dental filling materials and lung cancer death after adjusting for tobacco smoking [3], whereas another report showed no significant associations between BPA exposure from dental amalgam fillings and cancer survival after controlling for other factors including cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption [4]. Although it is unclear whether there was a causal relationship between exposure to BPA from dental fillings and the development of lung cancers, recent evidence suggests that the risks may be dose dependent [6] – [10]. It has recently been demonstrated that BPA inhibits cell division and apoptosis, which can lead to cellular transformation [11].

A year later, in June 2011, Tariq's mother received notice from the state of Michigan that her son would be placed in foster care. The reason: ""I am pregnant."" She says her daughter was born prematurely at just over 32 weeks gestation, which meant she wasn't considered capable of caring for him due to his condition. Tariq underwent surgery at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital to repair damage to his spine and other injuries sustained during the fall.

But when he returned home last summer, according to a report by Detroit's WDIV-TV, his mother discovered bruises on his body — including bite marks on his shoulders and neck. After being questioned about them, Tariq told her they were self inflicted. But despite being unable to identify the source of the attacks, police arrested him on suspicion of assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder. They are considering charging him as a juvenile offender. In court documents released after Tariq appeared before Judge John H. O'Donnell this week, officers wrote that they believed he committed domestic violence and battery against two men. According to the documents, one man said he was punched in the face while walking down the street with another man. The second man also claimed that someone had beaten him up inside a car near the corner of East Washington Street and Gratiot Avenue.

Tariq faces more than 10 years behind bars if convicted of both charges against him. His attorney, Craig Futterman, contends that his client is innocent. When asked what would happen if Tariq doesn't show up in court, Futterman replies, ""Well, you know what we're going to do? We'll continue to fight to get him out.

A study by the University of California, Berkeley found that one-third of all meat in North America comes from animals raised on factory farms, where they're fed grain and other high-energy crops rather than grasses and their byproducts—a process called ""intensive"" farming. The researchers discovered that intensive animal agriculture is responsible for roughly 15 percent of greenhouse gas emissions globally. An increase of only 1% to 2% could avert the biggest climate change threat today: a temperature rise of more than 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit).

The same team has recently developed a new model that can predict global carbon footprints from plant production. The researchers have used the results to estimate how much CO2 could be saved if farmers switch to less energy-dense foods such as beans, lentils and coconut. They also showed that an entire year's worth of food produced in intensive systems may yield up to 25 times as much CO2 reduction as would be possible with a typical American diet based on whole grains and vegetables.

The findings, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last month, suggest a number of ways to decrease fossil fuel use while simultaneously reducing the amount of land required for crop production. For example, a single acre of Brazil nut plantations would supply nearly half of the world's soybean imports, but only produce about 7 pounds per person. By switching to Brazil nuts, we could cut our demand for the product by 50%, saving 3 million acres of farmland worldwide every year. And since rice accounts for 40% of the world's dietary protein intake, it makes sense to substitute some or all of it for corn. As the United Nations Food & Agriculture Organization notes, using nonfood crops will not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions; it could also improve soil quality and reduce water pollution.

She even told me about different methods to use for healing. One method would be to go into an intense meditation, which could take up several hours. Another method would be to focus on something you were interested in (like reading) and let your mind wander away from that. And then there are other techniques like using visual aids such as colored paper with symbols written on it or playing music which will help you relax and get closer to what you're thinking.

I chose to go into psychology because I wanted to find out if I can cure mental illnesses. When I started college, I thought I would just study psychology, like everything else I studied. However, when I saw the level of interest from my classmates and professors, I decided to change my major because I knew that I am very good at psychology. I majored in sociology and minor in philosophy and I also took one class in counseling. Since I've always enjoyed writing poetry, it didn't bother me too much either. While I was still in college, I interned for the New York City Department of Mental Health, so I got a chance to see firsthand what it takes to make sure that patients receive quality services. From there, I moved to graduate school where I earned both a master's degree in public health and a Ph.D., all while continuing my studies in psychology. My current job has been here since 2011, and usually it lasts three months at a time. During this time, I also teach courses and occasionally speak at conferences.

Heart Palpitations Heart palpitations may occur when you're at risk of having a serious medical emergency. They happen when the heart's rhythm becomes too irregular. When this happens, there is more blood pressure drop on one side than on the other. This makes it harder for the heart muscle to pump blood through the body. It can also cause the left ventricle to become enlarged, causing chest pain. For most people with epilepsy, the heart has its own warning system called the bradycardia reflex. If it's abnormal, your heartbeat will slow down. During an episode of hypoglycemia, the heart rate usually slows down even further. This is called bradyarrhythmic tachycardia. The heart beats at less than 60 percent of maximum capacity and pumps out low amounts of oxygenated blood. People who experience rapid heartbeats during a seizure should always seek immediate medical attention because the condition could lead to cardiac arrest or death. Signs and symptoms of an arrhythmia include: chest discomfort

A few weeks ago, I was invited to speak at a symposium about food science by John Robbins at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and Professor David Wolfe of Washington State University. The purpose was to explore what we know about fructose and sugar—what it's made of, how much is there, what its effects are on our bodies, and what we can do about it. I'm glad to report that my talk was very well received; several attendees asked me if they could watch it online for free, which I am extremely grateful for! (If you'd like to see the video, just click here.) But before getting into specifics, let me start with an overview of what has happened over the past 30 years:

The early 20th century saw the emergence of the ""dominant"" model, which held that sugars were simply bad things and should be avoided as much as possible. Most modern nutritionists have come around to this point of view, but some still cling to it vigorously. These ideas were challenged recently when a group led by Drs. David Ludwig and Walter Willett found in their studies using data from more than 600,000 people that there was no relationship between dietary intake of sugars and risk of heart disease or stroke. They concluded that low carbohydrate diets might not be dangerous, and recommended further research.

Ludwig and colleagues also found that sugar consumption in children did not increase the likelihood of obesity, diabetes, or other chronic diseases. In fact, they reported lower rates of all these problems among participants who ate most of their calories from refined carbohydrates such as white bread and pasta. This surprised the researchers because many parents believe that eating sweets makes kids fat, so they tend to limit their child's consumption. As noted in the New York Times article referenced above, ""In a recent analysis of nearly 6,000 children published in the Journal of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Pediatrics said children who consumed at least five teaspoons of added sugar daily were twice as likely to become overweight.""

This is important because as I will discuss below, the new research provides evidence that refined carbohydrate foods may indeed promote obesity, diabetes, and other chronic conditions that result in high blood pressure and cholesterol. (I'll share more details about those issues in Part 2). For now, it's worth noting that the sugar industry seems to think that the prevailing dogma on the dangers of",112,symptoms of asthma,-12.442853927612305,192,no_prompt,2,0.9142857142857143,435,17

PTCO (phenylpiracetam) PTCO is a nootropic drug used for improving memory. It works by increasing acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter in your brain that controls movement, memory and learning abilities. This also helps improve coordination.

Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) CRF is an enzyme which regulates the release of the hormone cortisone from the adrenal glands. Cortisol increases blood pressure, heart rate and breathing so CRF inhibits this process, thereby helping reduce your body's stress response.

Tauroursodeoxycholic acid Taurourdes are a group of compounds found in plants such as tea leaves or coffee beans. They have been shown to increase levels of cholinesterase, which breaks down the amino acids taurine and leucine into their active forms: dihydrotestosterone and lutropinogen. These two substances are responsible for testosterone production. The effects can be observed after just one cup of green tea with taurourde (200 mg). In addition, it has been suggested that these chemicals might reduce the occurrence of depression and anxiety in people who have low T3 levels. Some studies suggest that tauroursodeoxycholic acid may help prevent cancer and promote longevity in rats.

Luteolin Luteolin is an essential oil extracted from Chinese herbs such as Burdock Root or Horsetail, which can decrease inflammation. Luteolin was first isolated during the mid 1800s when it was discovered that the extract had anti-inflammatory properties. Luteolin has since been extensively studied to understand its biological activities on various tissues including bone marrow cells.

Polysaccharide A polysaccharide is an organic molecule consisting of more than one sugar unit linked together in a chain structure. Polysaccharides play crucial roles in many systems of our body. Many natural polysaccharides have been demonstrated to have various beneficial properties. For example, they have been linked to healthy cholesterol metabolism and control insulin secretion. However, some polysaccharides have not yet been well researched because of limited availability or lack of suitable animal models. One such compound which could benefit cancer patients is resveratrol, a polysaccharide found in red wine and grapes. Resveratrol has been shown to inhibit tumor cell growth, boost immune function and increase resistance against oxidative damage.

The most common one is, ""When your symptoms return and you can't move your legs or feel any type of numbness in the arms, it's probably MS."" And then we have other people who say, ""I've had a lot of medical problems lately, I think it might be my anxiety disorder."" It really depends on the person. Everyone has their own unique story about what they're going through that puts them at risk for getting back into a disease cycle again. So how do we know if our diagnoses are accurate?

We do know from research that patients are less likely to receive a true diagnosis when they ask for an evaluation by a health care professional than when they go directly to the pharmacy or clinic. So, maybe doctors should be more open-minded. But I also don't want to make a statement that all doctors are bad because some doctors may not always take your symptoms seriously because they just don't understand why you're experiencing them. In general, it would be great to see more resources available on the Internet for patients who need help diagnosing MS.

Another big misconception with MS is that there is no cure. The reality is that there are treatments out there that will give you relief from symptoms that will keep you alive for years. If you haven't already seen a neurologist, please consider doing so before you start using medicinal marijuana. One thing I love about the state of California right now is they allow patients to use medical marijuana without being charged with a crime. There are quite a few states considering similar legislation, but until you are legally allowed to possess cannabis and smoke it, you cannot get treated for MS without having to wait for approval from your doctor. This means that doctors could miss out on seeing a patient for years if they don't give permission first. We must push forward and change laws to recognize those who suffer from MS and legalize its use.

What advice do you have for someone who needs to get into treatment with medical marijuana and hasn't tried it yet?

You must know that your brain chemistry changes when you use it regularly. Your body gets rid of a lot of harmful compounds. You'll begin feeling tired much faster, your heart rate slows down significantly, and you won't suffer the debilitating side effects of medications as often.

Treatment was initiated at a rate of one per week for the first two months of chemotherapy, then one per month thereafter until complete resolution of symptoms and death in approximately 85% of patients. The remaining 15% were either lost to follow-up or relapsed after completing the initial course of therapy. In addition, at least eight biopsies were obtained during each course of chemo, with at least three biopsy sets completed before completion of therapy ( ). Patients had all undergone full surgical resection followed by radiation therapy. All patients underwent bone marrow transplantation, but this procedure did not lead to any further recurrence after diagnosis.

Discussion

In this case series, we documented that triple positive women who have undergone early invasive screening mammography, which has been found to be effective in predicting the risk of breast cancer [1], are at increased risk of recurrent disease. This observation suggests that early detection of the disease may result in additional benefit beyond those observed following previous studies investigating the relationship between early screening and subsequent recurrence rates [5]. We also demonstrated that these same subjects experienced higher mortality rates when compared to other subgroups of women undergoing similar types of breast cancer treatments, including adjuvant treatment, hormone receptor mutations, hereditary breast cancer syndromes, or other rare tumors. These findings suggest that the potential benefits of early screening and diagnostic follow-up strategies need to be considered in the consideration of treatment options.

The primary goal of our study was to determine whether triple positive individuals undergo early invasive breast cancer screening, particularly if they develop symptomatic disease after completion of routine screening. For many years, it has been known that triple negative individuals have a higher than average lifetime risk of developing breast cancer [3–6] and have a lower than average chance of being diagnosed within five years after beginning regular screening [7]. Although this finding is intuitively appealing because some researchers hypothesized that individuals who receive multiple biopsies from their breasts during the early stages of breast cancer are more likely to be detected earlier than others, there has never been an empirical demonstration that this hypothesis holds true [8–10]. Our experience demonstrates that women undergoing screening early in the course of breast cancer are at greater risk of experiencing recurrence as compared to those who do not undergo screening, even though this group includes both premenopausal and postmenopausal women [11]. Because the clinical utility of early invasive mammographic screening has become apparent over time, several organizations have now recommended its use among women presenting with early breast pain or swelling [12",118,stage 4 triple negative breast cancer treatment,-0.078900322318077,15,no_prompt,2,0.06726457399103139,432,21

First, MS sufferers must first have an established disease that affects their brain or spinal cord in order for them to be able to legally be employed without restriction by the government. This means you can't just start working as a freelance artist if you are diagnosed with MS. You also won't get employment restrictions on your medical condition simply because you want to stay at home and take care of yourself while still being able to make a living. To do this, you'll need to meet several requirements to determine whether it's medically appropriate for you to return to work:

1. Have you had a diagnosis from a doctor

2. Have you been in remission (not having any symptoms) for three months

3. Have you been experiencing severe fatigue

4. Have you completed two years of therapy

5. Have you been unable to perform any activities for more than 24 hours

6. Have you been unable to complete any physical activity

7. Were your cognitive abilities tested for language, memory, concentration and other skills

8. Are there any residual symptoms in your body that make you feel unwell? If so, are they worse than when you started working?

9. How will you manage your disability pension, benefits and expenses during your illness? Will you be eligible for Employment Insurance? What type of work will you be doing? Will you require assistance in getting around or cooking? How will you cope when you go home sick? Is family support available?

10. Do you feel ready to handle a job that requires travel, time away from home, a shift schedule and lots of long periods of waiting?

11. Where would you like to live? Do you already own property and if so, how much could you afford to buy or rent, if not outright? Do you have friends who may help you out financially, if needed?

12. Are you willing to move back into your parents' house if necessary? If not, what else might be possible?

If you fit all those criteria and can demonstrate that you are capable of handling all of the above factors, then perhaps some day you will be able to enjoy a career as a freelancer or independent artist, instead of dealing with crippling fatigue and debilitating pain every single day!",81,Can I work and study full-time with multiple sclerosis?,-0.097621813416481,2,no_prompt,2,0.0091324200913242,402,11

Many of these young people die from preventable causes such as heart attacks or stroke that can be treated easily with medication, rather than cancer or diabetes, which require expensive surgery and other medical interventions. The result is an epidemic of diseases that cannot be easily cured through medicine, but must be prevented by effective policies that reduce exposure to risk factors. In addition, the aging population places additional stress on healthcare systems due to increased need for services and the growing number of older adults who will necessitate multiple health care visits over their lives.

What causes obesity? How does it increase morbidity and mortality?

Obesity has become one of the largest public health problems facing our nation today, affecting almost 30 percent of Americans—and more women than men. Obesity increases the risk of premature death because it contributes to several cardiovascular conditions including hypertension (high blood pressure), type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, gallbladder disease, stroke and certain types of cancers.

How did this happen and what causes it?

The prevalence of obesity in America began to rise in the 1960s, primarily in communities where people were not physically active. This trend continued through the 1980s when more affluent populations became increasingly overweight. By 1992, about 21 percent of American children and adolescents were obese—an increase of 20 percentage points since 1970. However, the dramatic decline in childhood obesity occurred between 2002-2004—the last year for which data is available. The average body mass index for those aged 2–19 years fell by about 3.8 percentage points during that time period, the biggest drop since measurement began in 1971. However, many states experienced greater declines than others; Alaska's BMI decreased by 4.5 percentage points, while Indiana's was down by only 0.4 percentage point.

How do we address the problem? Is there any hope?

There are no silver bullets for combating obesity. Prevention efforts focus on the eating habits of individuals, families and schools. Public health campaigns encourage people to eat better and exercise regularly so they are less likely to gain weight and develop the complications of being overweight and obese. Policies aim to make healthy foods more affordable for all consumers, while limiting marketing to kids, and promoting low-fat and lower calorie foods. Additionally, policies target unhealthy behaviors like overeating and lack of physical activity through taxation, regulation and education programs. These approaches work best if they are well coordinated across",1,What are the most common chronic diseases?

The survey shows that although most workers who have been diagnosed with the disease have got on well in their jobs so far - 70% of them say they enjoy what they do - the vast majority feel nervous about revealing their condition.

In fact, only 13% said they felt confident telling their boss they were experiencing problems with mobility or balance.

And when asked whether they knew anyone else who has had the same diagnosis as themselves, just 2% of those surveyed replied yes.

But despite this, almost half (46%) say they plan to tell their employer about their illness because they want to make sure the company is taking care of them.

One worker told us: ""My husband's in his late 50s. He's been very fortunate. We've lived through some bad times but he says 'we've always done OK'.

gpt2-xl_35,"This is an important question that deserves more attention than it gets. The answer depends on the person and their condition, but most health care providers would agree that if you are diabetic or have type 2 diabetes (or any other metabolic disorder) then a ketogenic diet may be unsuitable. If you already take insulin to manage your blood glucose levels then the switch from a high carb diet to a low-carb diet will generally increase your insulin dosage. So in addition to increasing insulin dose you may also experience symptoms of hypoglycemia such as fatigue, weakness, dizziness and nausea. With so many benefits associated with ketosis and being able to lower both carbohydrate and fat intake (not just fats), this may seem like an obvious choice. However there are some downsides to switching over from a high carb diet to a low carb diet. Some people find it difficult to give up bread, pasta, rice and potatoes which tend to contain carbohydrates. Others find it hard to reduce intake of sugar sweetened foods. Some people feel nauseous when they eat these foods. These feelings can last for days after eating these foods and may lead to a feeling of 'brain fog' – even if the food has been chosen according to healthy nutritional values. It's worth noting that not everyone reacts badly to this change so don't worry too much about it – there are still lots of great things to enjoy without grains! Another potential problem is that switching over to a low carb diet may affect your mood. You might experience changes such as: irritability, anxiety, depression, confusion or difficulty concentrating. Sometimes all of the above conditions go together into a single episode of depression known as a major depressive episode (MDE). This isn't always the case though and sometimes it happens separately from one another. In my opinion the best way to get better from a depression episode is by making sure you're getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly (see below). As with other forms of mental illness, taking prescribed medications helps to control the symptoms of depression. A good diet should also help to treat MDE, although it takes time for changes in weight loss and appetite to become noticeable.


Is a ketogenic / keto diet appropriate if I'm pregnant?

It seems very likely that a ketogenic / keto diet is appropriate for women who are trying to conceive. There are several reasons why this may be the case. Firstly, having a keto diet will help to bring down blood sugar levels, which means the levels of hormones and",35,Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?,-0.0809690654277801,3,no_prompt,2,0.01935483870967742,438,46

The survey, conducted by Ipsos Mori in partnership with The Institute for Fiscal Studies, also asked respondents to rate their own level of physical activity — whether it was regular or infrequent — as well as their views on a range of topics including exercise and obesity. The data was weighted to be nationally representative of the adult population aged 16 and over.

Overall, more than half (56%) of British adults reported that they were either very physically active (15% of people) or somewhat active (32%). Just under one-third (29%) said they were not at all active; this is around twice the proportion reporting moderate or high levels of activity (8%).

On most issues, women are considerably more likely than men to report being very or somewhat active. Women were four times as likely as men to say that they were moderately or highly active: 19% vs 5%. On questions of how much people engage in ""exercise"" each day (for example, whether an average of 20 minutes per day counts as a typical amount), women were only slightly less likely than men to do so (26% versus 27%, respectively).

Physical activity among adults across the UK Source: General Lifestyle Survey 2011

However, the picture becomes more complex when taking gender differences into account. Men, who have higher rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and heart failure than women, are actually less likely than women to report being very active. In addition, there is evidence that people with lower incomes, who tend to live longer lives, may experience greater psychological distress from low levels of physical activity.

There is strong support for greater public awareness of the across all age groups, but particularly in younger generations. A quarter (27%) of 18–24 year olds said that they regularly engaged in some form of physical activity, compared to 17% of those aged 65+ years. And while women were more likely than men to say they had taken part in a sport competition in the last 12 months, just 4% did so in the previous week compared with 8% of both genders.

But despite this, more than two thirds (68%) of people aged over 70 said they were still fit to take part in regular physical activity compared to just over half (52%) of those aged 18–24 years.

If the surgery has been performed before birth by a skilled physician or nurse, it should heal well.

So far, so good. But there's a problem: there are no certified professionals in traditional Chinese medicine, which means that if you want to make real changes in your health – like getting rid of bad habits or boosting your immunity — you'll need to learn from practitioners who have actually completed the program. This has led some to raise questions about whether the $19,000 tuition for the course will be worth it, considering that one-on-one sessions with a master would cost less than $10 per hour at an acupuncture clinic.

The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) has a doctorate degree program in traditional Chinese medicine called the Master of Traditional Chinese Medicine (MTCMC). The university offers the program as part of its undergraduate school curriculum but also offers a separate online certificate, which costs nearly half as much. There isn't enough information on the UTMB site to tell whether the program is accredited, although they note that students can receive additional training abroad in China and other countries.

""I did my research first because I was concerned about this whole thing being overpriced,"" says Chris St. Hilaire, M.D., chief executive officer of Integrative Healthcare Institute and chairperson of the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine. St. Hilaire has been practicing TCM in Houston since 1997. He says his organization doesn't currently offer the online certification.

Traditional Chinese medicine is based around two principles, according to Dr. Robert C. Greenleaf, vice president for education and director of the Center for Health Education at the National Institutes of Health. First, he explains, is that there is no single standard of medical practice. Rather, each practitioner has their own style, which varies depending on where they came up in their studies. Second, the philosophy behind TCM involves recognizing and understanding the interplay between physical, mental and spiritual systems; and cultivating harmony through harmonizing the elements within and outside the body. Greenleaf adds that all these concepts relate to ""mind-body wellness.""

This does not mean the patient has MS; it just means that their symptoms have returned after being dormant for more than two weeks (this was not a new symptom, but rather a re-occurring one).

The fact that patients with an active disease can be diagnosed as having MS and receive treatment without relapses makes this type of therapy very appealing to researchers working on ways to prevent or treat multiple sclerosis. The first drug in development based upon these principles is called rituximab (Remicade), developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals. It works in mice, and has already shown promise in treating MS. Another candidate is adalimumab (Humira), another anti-TNF agent that works similarly to Remicade. However, unlike Remicade, Humira will need FDA approval before it is given to humans.

These drugs work by blocking inflammatory responses by binding to TNF receptors and preventing them from causing harmful inflammation. This has the potential to slow down the progression of multiple sclerosis in patients who already have it. Unfortunately, while promising results have been seen in some trials, there's still no cure for multiple sclerosis at present, so any drug that slows its progression would only offer temporary relief.

In our study, the mean percentage of patients who had any symptoms at all was 24%. In the subgroup of patients with normal serum TSH levels, this percentage ranged from 20% (n = 30) to 34% (n = 21). This means that for every 10 patients whose serum TSH level was below the reference range, 2 also had moderate or severe hyperthyroidism. In comparison, only 14% of patients with milder conditions had any problems (Table ). Thus, even though these patients may be taking less active medications than those with severe disease, their clinical situation indicates the presence of severe hyperthyroidism.

The frequency of symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome increased significantly with increasing duration and severity of hypothyroidism [Fisher's exact test, p = 0.023]. At the same time, it has been reported that the prevalence of fatigue increased more slowly and reached its maximum values at approximately two years after onset of illness [10], which is very close to the age when the majority of patients are treated with anti-hyperthyroid drugs. A similar trend was observed in our study: the proportion of people having some type of fatigue increased from 7% at baseline to 23% at six months after diagnosis. These findings are consistent with previous studies where no differences were found between patients on treatment with the most effective anti-thyroid medication and those on placebo or other non-active medications [11,12].

It is important to note that both symptoms and the degree of hyperthyroidism did not correlate statistically with the number of patients who dropped out during the first visit. The reason is probably related to the fact that the initial visits were performed primarily for evaluation purposes (to check if there was an association between thyroid deficiency and other factors), but not",123,hypothyroidism symptoms,-8.162394523620605,73,no_prompt,2,0.4506172839506173,373,5

For many people with MS, their symptoms are severe enough that they need to take action now to improve their quality of life by controlling their glucose levels (see the section above on low-grade inflammation).

In addition to being able to increase insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation – which can help you feel better even if you don't see any improvements in your MS symptoms – you should also try to minimize stress by managing your stress through meditation. This will enable you to calm down, especially if you've been experiencing physical symptoms or mood changes that may be linked to chronic stress. Meditation can also boost your immune system so that when you do experience an attack it won't cause you harm as much as it would otherwise.

Meditation helps us to feel more relaxed, which makes our brains less likely to overreact to threats. Stress reduces our ability to cope with pain, and this results in increased susceptibility to infections. Meditation is one of the best ways to relieve stress and enhance your immune function (1). A recent study found that mindfulness practice improved brain scans for both the amygdala and hippocampus – important parts of the brain involved in memory and emotion. The researchers think that because mindfulness improves connectivity between these regions (2), this might be why meditation reduces stress and increases immunity (3). It seems pretty clear that if you're suffering from chronic anxiety or depression then meditating may well be a good thing! But if you want to learn more about how meditation can benefit your health, check out this article: Mindfulness Training for Health Benefits.


What can I eat to reduce inflammation and keep my body functioning normally?

If you suffer from low cholesterol, high triglycerides, or high blood pressure then eating plenty of vegetables rich in vitamin C and antioxidants such as carrots, spinach, broccoli, tomatoes, parsley, leeks, garlic, ginger root and more will support the repair process. Vitamin C is essential to the normal production of prostaglandins, which have been shown to decrease inflammation and help with the healing process (4). A Mediterranean diet rich in fruits, vegetables, fish and whole grains has also been shown to support a strong immune response. Eating three or four servings of fruit daily is also thought to help lower blood sugar levels and regulate inflammation. Other foods that contain significant amounts of vitamin C include oranges, grapef",55,How to manage multiple sclerosis?,-0.2176301628351211,9,no_prompt,2,0.036585365853658534,439,21

The optical density of an object depends on its size and shape. For example, a large piece of glass with round edges has much higher optical density than a flat square sheet of glass. The reason is that a small circle or diamond in the center of the circular sheet can be more efficiently diffracted by the larger surface area of the rounded edge. A rough diamond blade on a table saw would have even greater diffraction efficiency than the smooth diamond blade in a laptop screen. Diffraction drops off dramatically as the diameter increases. This is why it is difficult to use light on a cell phone screen to read text at any distance other than about 20 inches (50 cm). In contrast, the diffracting power of a large mirror like the one used in the computer display is roughly proportional to the radius squared. If you put a mirror on a very tall building, you will get a magnified view of the landscape behind your city or town. But if you are viewing from only 1 mile (1.6 km) away, magnification will drop sharply. At distances approaching 50 miles (80 km), you would need two mirrors to bring out all the detail in a scene.


For objects closer than a few dozen feet away, there is no such thing as ""laser vision"". The human eye can detect motion blur in images, but this requires the viewer to focus on a point to which he is focused and then move his eyes around the image to make sure that he sees something moving. We can do both simultaneously using our peripheral vision. Moving our eyes quickly and carefully makes us able to distinguish hundreds of pixels in a photo, although it takes time and practice to learn how to do this effectively. When people look at a screen in a movie theater they cannot tell what part of a film clip was moved on-screen. They just see a continuous black background. To them, the screen appears to be static. Even though we know that the projector is projecting the picture onto a curved screen, when we look straight ahead at the screen, we simply see nothing. As soon as we turn our head to look backwards, however, the projected image appears to come into focus. With the advent of high definition video, movies appear sharper because the resolution is higher, but this effect also decreases as the distance from the screen increases.

The researchers also compared the effects of low-carbohydrate diets to those high in carbohydrates, which is what many people are advised to do as part of a ""low-fat diet."" In this case, they did not find any differences between them in terms of weight loss or blood glucose levels after six months. But on average, the low-carb group lost more body fat than the low-fat group. The difference was most pronounced among men, where low-carb diets resulted in approximately 20 percent fewer pounds of fat loss.

""We found that carbohydrate restriction without calorie counting has important health benefits,"" says senior author Dr. Daniela Jakubowicz, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and an endocrinologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. She continues: ""One benefit is that it causes a significant reduction in LDL cholesterol – and that may be useful for reducing cardiovascular disease risk.""

But not everyone agrees with these findings. A new study published last week in Diabetes Care showed that one year of dieting actually increased blood sugar levels while lowering HDL (good) cholesterol and increasing triglycerides. That's why many nutrition experts recommend against diets higher than about 50 percent carbohydrates.

These results suggest that, if you want to lower your blood sugar level without eating large amounts of carbs, then switching to a non-starchy vegetable-based diet might work well enough. It would still allow you to consume plenty of protein but avoid so-called 'bad' fats like saturated and trans fats, explains Dr. Ludwig.

These categories are more accurately described as sensory, motor or central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, with the CNS being the part of our brain which controls vision, hearing, taste and touch; it is located in the back of your head near the ear.

Visual Symptoms

Eye pain - This symptom can appear any time you need to move your eyes but more commonly affects people who have experienced an eye injury, such as a broken glass or foreign object, as well as those with glaucoma or macular degeneration. You may experience discomfort when you close your eyelids or when you look at something directly in front of your face. The sensation will be most noticeable during the day. Your vision may become blurry or black out for short periods.

You may experience discomfort when you close your eyelids or when you look at something directly in front of your face. The sensation will be most noticeable during the day. Your vision may become blurry or black out for short periods. Visual disturbance - Some people describe this symptom as feeling like they cannot focus on anything for longer than five minutes. It's not uncommon to feel dizzy and nauseous. If this occurs frequently, you should see a doctor for evaluation.


Auditory Symptoms

Tinnitus - Tinnitus means ringing or buzzing noises that don't go away after a while. Your tinnitus may sound like a continuous humming, clicking, chirping or hissing sound. Other sounds that cause tinnitus include high pitched noise, a loud car alarm, fireworks, fireworks crackers, airplane engines, jet engine exhausts, metal scraping or thunder. You might also hear tapping or other sounds coming from your own body. If there is no underlying medical condition causing your tinnitus, then it could indicate that an infection is interfering with the normal functioning of certain cells in your inner ears, leading to a condition known as tinnitus vulgaris, a term meaning loud ringing, hissing, roaring, or whistling. There are many causes of tinnitus including allergies and medicines used for conditions such as sinusitis, inflammation of the ears or head and neck problems. Many tinnitus sufferers",68,List of multiple sclerosis symptoms,-10.923290252685549,174,no_prompt,2,0.7873303167420814,406,10

One example of this kind of analysis is published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

Researchers studied 1,845 patients who had been diagnosed with MS over a six-year period to determine the most common stage of the disease, and then compared these data with the number of people enrolled into clinical trials for drug development during that time.

They found that many patients were given an incorrect diagnosis because they did not follow their doctors' orders about what tests to perform or when to stop taking drugs.

""A lot of these new treatments come from Phase I studies - things like gene editing, stem cell therapy,"" said lead researcher Dr. Peter Goadsby, professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""But what we're finding out is it's not always clear where those therapies start and end.""

The scientists also say that some patients might have received a wrong treatment based on incorrect information in clinical trial databases. For instance, one patient was prescribed a drug while being monitored for MS as part of another study. However, since she didn't need the drug, her doctor gave it to her without telling his colleagues. She ended up getting worse.

Goadsby says he hopes that by collecting more information about the types of data that are collected and shared among different researchers studying the same diseases, there will be greater clarity about how important early detection and early intervention really are.",57,multiple sclerosis stages phases,-7.770972728729248,13,no_prompt,2,0.06280193236714976,249,0

At the end of 2013, Takeda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (TAK) announced that it had completed a Phase 2 clinical trial of the first ever drug to target MS's immune system by targeting B-cell malignancies in a brain region called the hippocampus. The company is now moving forward with trials in a separate phase 3 trial for patients who have already failed the prior treatment and are not candidates for an active therapy.

""While we still have a long way to go before we can predict what this new treatment will do to patients' lives, I am encouraged by the positive data from the Phase 1/2 trials,"" said Michael Kriegstein, M.D., chief medical officer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. ""This represents significant progress toward developing a promising new cancer drug candidate.""

The studies will be conducted at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York City; in London; at Brigham & Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston; and at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland.

Cancer drugs are increasingly being developed for use in multiple sclerosis. In 2010, Gilead Sciences, Inc.

gpt2-xl_72,"Dr. C.M. Bhatia, a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School, has reviewed studies on the safety of the three main vaccines used to prevent meningitis, influenza or whooping cough, which can be fatal if not treated promptly with antibiotics: the DtaP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) shot; Menactra (meningococcal conjugate) vaccine; and FluMist (flu). ""There is not enough information yet available to make any recommendations,"" Dr. Bhatia told ScienceInsider. He added that he had never heard of a case of meningitis caused by DTaP, but that he would like to see more data. He also said there was no evidence that the three vaccines were linked to an increased risk of autism among children. (The CDC did say that all children under age 6 should get two doses of DTaP and one dose of Menactra.)

""It's possible that people who received two doses of DTaP before September 2001 were vulnerable to infection, and this may have contributed to the number of cases reported after 9/11,"" wrote Dr. John Olshansky, director of the Vaccine Safety Office at the FDA, in a letter dated June 27, 2004. But Dr. Bhatia found no such connection between the DTaP shots given to infants during infancy and the spike in autism rates.

Another study by David Gorski, a neuroscientist at UCLA, and his colleagues published last month suggests that a second type of mercury, called thimerosal, could be responsible for some of the autism cases. Thimerosal, which is part of many childhood vaccines, contains ethylmercury, which is toxic to both adults and fetuses because it accumulates in fat cells and kidneys, leading to cardiovascular disease, neurological problems and behavioral disorders. According to the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, however, the thimerosal contained in flu vaccines made from contaminated source materials — such as those manufactured in China or Mexico, which are now banned from use — does not cause birth defects, including autism. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected an application earlier this year to add the additive back into routine vaccination.

But there's no such thing as an 'all-or-nothing' test for MS. The disease can only be passed on when a person has two copies of the mutated gene in their bodies; one copy is normal, while the other is the mutation.

How many people have MS?

MS affects about 1 million Americans each year, but scientists estimate that 20 percent of those afflicted never develop symptoms. More than 100 different genes may contribute to the disease. In addition, a variety of environmental factors affect how someone develops MS. For example:

A mother who gets pregnant before she becomes sexually active may give her children a higher risk of developing MS.

Maternal smoking during pregnancy increases the chance that the fetus will be born prematurely (also called fetal alcohol syndrome), which puts babies at greater risk of developing severe neurological problems later in life.

Pregnant women with HIV may have babies affected by the virus. Because of this, doctors recommend that HIV positive mothers abstain from sex until they become pregnant and breastfeed their infants exclusively for the first six months. This allows the infant's immune system time to strengthen and avoid becoming infected with HIV. Some researchers believe that this practice could protect young children exposed to the virus from getting the disease.

Children whose mothers take certain drugs during pregnancy and labor may face increased risks of neurological problems, including MS.

INTRODUCTION Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive neurological disorder caused by the deposition of immune-active lesions on nerve cells, particularly those that innervate the central nervous system and spinal cord. Most individuals with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 years.1 In most cases, these lesions progress slowly over decades, but occasionally lesions become more extensive and cause severe disability within months or even days. It has been estimated that about 5% of people with MS have relapses after their initial relapse; the rates for relapsing/remitting disease may be higher among young adults ( ). Open in a separate window The prevalence of MS varies widely according to geographic location and socioeconomic status. A recent study found that nearly half of all persons in the United States had some form of MS,2 and this estimate was based primarily on hospital records. Although approximately one third of the population who have ever experienced an episode of MS will develop it again at least once in their lifetime,3 it is important to note that relapsing/ remitting disease does not necessarily equate to subsequent disability. For instance, a person who has a second stroke when they are only 50 years old could recover fully from their first stroke and still experience full motor function as an adult. Relapse of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is thought to arise from demyelination of axons during early stages of myelin development,4,5 can occur several years later than the original onset of symptoms. This ""delay"" in the progression of the disease is believed to contribute to its longevity and remission rate.6 Because many factors influence the course of MS, many studies attempt to identify risk factors for developing the disease in future generations of patients and their families.7–11 Several epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to environmental hazards like lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), pesticides, etc., appears to increase the likelihood of developing MS in the next generation.12,13 However, the role of genetics and other biological processes in determining susceptibility remains unclear. To date, most research studies examining the relationship between genes and MS have relied solely on maternal family history.14–16 Studies investigating the potential association between parental age and MS risk have produced inconsistent results,17–19 although in one case the authors concluded that ""[i]nherited predisposition cannot explain the increased risk seen in younger parents.""20 Because many genetic variants may also increase susceptibility to certain types",58,Risk to develop multiple sclerosis,-0.3224658370018005,4,no_prompt,2,0.017316017316017316,413,18

The following tips will help you get started:

Make sure your vaccinations are up-to-date. For example, flu vaccine may be the first one you receive for some people but it isn't always followed by all others. You should also check that any medicines or supplements you're taking don't contain ingredients that might harm you if they go into your circulation. Talk about this with your doctor. You'll need to make changes to how you live as well as altering your diet.

Take care when you take medicine - particularly antibiotics. Your doctor may recommend that you avoid antibiotic use. These drugs aren't safe in children under 16 years old. In particular, do not give them to someone else unless their doctor is happy. Also, talk to your doctor before giving any other types of medicine to children aged between six months and 12 years (including adults).

I have chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), also known as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis or ME, often described in medical literature by a few different terms such as acute-onset, progressive, post-exertional malaise, chronic fatigue, flare up, etc.

The term chronic is what sets me apart from many people who are diagnosed with the illness but do not actually suffer from symptoms; they might be fatigued for several days at a time or even weeks at a time, but never become so tired that their ability to function is compromised. This does not mean I'm healthy though.

A recent study conducted by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) has confirmed what many ME sufferers already knew – ME is a disease of the immune system. A disease caused by long periods of inflammation, particularly in a part of our bodies called the nervous system.

The researchers found evidence that ME is characterized by a faulty or damaged brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF, which serves as a key player in regulating the balance of nerve cells throughout our body. It's like a muscle that becomes overworked and weak after years of being used regularly without maintenance. That's exactly how my body responded to the flu vaccine.

It took seven months until I felt well enough to go back to work, six months before I could return home, and finally another four months before I started feeling better again. When your body doesn't get its normal amount of rest and recovery, eventually it starts to shut down, the result of which can be debilitating or fatal for some people.

Unfortunately, there is no cure for ME/CFS, and I've spent nearly 25 years researching this problem. At first I thought the condition was just one of those things like seasonal allergies or asthma, something that you have to deal with through daily life but then don't realize all too well until it comes out into full force during sickness and the flu season.

However, in general terms it is a process of talking with someone who has experienced problems or issues that are related to their mind. It can also involve exploring ideas through various techniques including: hypnosis, talk therapy, biofeedback, cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), dream interpretation and more. This approach is generally referred to as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).

Who might benefit from psychotherapy?

Psychotherapy can help many people experiencing a range of mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, stress, low self-esteem, relationship problems, eating disorders, phobias, addiction and much more. People may have different ways they like to use treatment but all patients need psychological support to feel safe enough to take part in therapy. The majority of clients seeking counselling find that they get better without using psychoactive medication or therapy alone.

What do therapists usually do when working with people?

In a traditional therapeutic setting you will see the therapist every day for a set number of sessions. Depending on your needs this could be 15 minutes, 3 hours, 7 days a week. You then choose the time and place of each session, usually at a suitable location where you can relax, eat, sleep, watch television and work in peace.

How is psychotherapy done?

We will discuss a few typical stages of CBT practice. These include the following:

• Getting started: A brief introduction to you and your experience with emotions, thoughts and behaviours.

• Recognising triggers: What causes feelings of anxiety, anger, frustration and sadness?

• Understanding the nature of problems: How is thinking about yourself affecting your mood and behaviour?

• Developing coping skills: Learning how to cope with situations based around how these emotions affect you. For example: learning how to manage anger by focusing on something positive, understanding why feelings of fear lead to bad behaviour.

• Change planning: The plan for changing one's life and/or behaviour should include things to expect and avoid. Some examples may include:

• Avoidance: When negative thoughts arise, finding ways to change your environment to stop them from happening.

• Self-talk: Talking openly about difficult experiences to understand how to deal with them.

• Stress management: Practicing strategies to reduce stress before and after therapy so that negative feelings don't dominate your life.

Most type 2 diabetics are able to control their condition by taking insulin; however, the vast majority of T2D patients do not have access to such medication, making it impossible to cure the disease without surgery.

What Causes Type 2 Diabetes?

Type 2 diabetes develops due to increased fat consumption, which leads to a buildup of glucose inside cells. Insulin then responds by cutting off the flow of sugar into the bloodstream, causing a vicious cycle that eventually results in the pancreas producing too much insulin and becoming resistant to its effects.

In the case of T2D, excessive blood sugar levels can be caused by:

However, this study is limited by several potential limitations. First, the analysis included only women who were using oral contraceptives at the time of diagnosis. Because many users may discontinue their prescription because they develop adverse effects, it would be advisable to conduct follow-up studies comparing long-term effectiveness of estrogen plus progestin versus placebo. Second, there are no data on long-term safety and efficacy of combined contraceptive pills or progestins when taken alone. Third, the authors did not estimate the relative risks due to different patterns of use. Fourth, although all the cancers were found among postmenopausal women, most cases occurred before age 50 years. However, previous research has demonstrated that breast and prostate cancer occur more often among men in younger ages than older ones. Fifth, the analyses were based on self-reported information on use of estrogen-only products (oral contraceptives) and oral contraceptives containing synthetic estrogens. These substances have been shown to contain varying amounts of the active ingredient, and some are contraindicated during pregnancy for a variety of reasons (e.g., liver toxicity). Although the findings from the present study are consistent with previous reports showing an increased risk of breast cancer in association with the use of these products, further investigation into the possible mechanism of action needs to be undertaken. Finally, there could also be bias due to selection of patients included in the study, which may be influenced by socioeconomic factors such as education level. Therefore, future studies should include controls selected according to other relevant variables including ethnicity, lifestyle, family history and smoking habits.

They may be due to malabsorption of nutrients from the gut (hypochlorhydria) or may be secondary to other metabolic disturbances such as obesity or a poor diet. If you have these symptoms and they persist for more than one day, it is important to determine whether your dysbiosis can be resolved by dietary changes.

These effects vary depending on the patient's age at onset, duration of HFD, and severity of underlying pathology. In general, those who develop psychiatric disorders following prolonged HFD do so after a period lasting from several months to a few years, but this can differ between individuals; thus the exact cause(s) of psychiatric symptoms will depend on all of the above mentioned factors. 6.

What are the commonalities in menstrual problems, such as PMS or premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?

Menstruation and Multiple Sclerosis: A Brief History

Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system characterized by the inflammation of myelin sheaths that surround nerve cells. This inflammation can cause an imbalance between the amount of white matter and gray matter in the brain. At first, MS may not be related at all to sexual activity. However, for many women with MS, there seems to be an association of low levels of progesterone during the perimenopausal period with increased risk of developing MS later in life [1]. Women who experience early menopause have been found to have significantly higher rates of MS than non-users of birth control [2], possibly because they have less progesterone circulating through their bodies. In addition, hormonal changes associated with menopause make it harder to maintain adequate estrogen production. For some women, this leads to chronic fatigue, depression, anxiety, irritability, sleep disturbance, and other signs of stress. These symptoms are usually more prominent when women begin experiencing menopause, which happens about 1–3 years after menopause begins. Thus, these symptoms may be one factor contributing to the development of MS.


In fact, some studies have suggested that menopause itself may increase the risk of developing MS. Some women develop MS after having their menstrual cycles stop altogether while others develop MS soon after starting to menstruate again [3]. Many doctors believe that factors other than menstrual cycle changes are responsible for MS; however, no conclusive evidence exists yet for whether estrogen deficiency plays any role in the disease's development.


For decades, MS patients have had a hard time getting reliable information from health care professionals about how normal monthly menstrual cycles affect a woman's risk of developing MS. The only way to find out if someone has MS was to perform invasive testing on them. Since then, much has changed. Today, more women know about the importance of maintaining healthy menstrual cycles and know about hormone replacement therapy options. Also, there has been a growing body of research demonstrating that different types of hormones — including progestins, thyroid hormones, estrogens, and testosterone — play important roles in regulating the female reproductive process [4].


There are many reasons why the average woman might experience difficulty conceiving throughout her entire period. These include:

Foods We Eat

We have known about the physical dangers of too little protein for thousands of years—for example, in Hippocrates' advice against taking fish oil supplements because he thought that their lack of essential fatty acids might cause muscle wasting. In recent times, scientists have discovered new ways to make proteins that are lacking in humans. These include a group called beta-lactoglobulin (BLG), which causes diarrhea and can be used to treat inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's disease. Another group called alpha-galactosidase, also responsible for making vitamin K2, may be able to reduce cancer risk by improving blood clotting. Researchers in China recently identified another important protein missing from the human genome—a long chain of amino acids that plays an integral role in DNA replication. This means that in order to repair damaged DNA, genes must work together. Scientists at Columbia University announced this week that they had developed a way to use BLG to build up proteins that can fix defects in these chromosomes and then deliver them directly into cells where they'll do their healing work—regardless of whether they're from a human embryo or a mouse cell. The discovery could eventually allow researchers to generate functional replacement organs for patients with severe genetic disorders such as muscular dystrophy.

If anyone is considering changing jobs, then they should first talk to their doctor as there is plenty of information available on the condition. We recommend that employers do some research into MS before making any decisions about having someone with MS work in their company. It could make sense for your employer to offer a medical certificate or support group if you don't already have one. It's important to remember that although most people with MS can function well when away from work, there may still be some limitations.

There's also been anecdotal reports of improvements in insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control (in the form of reduced insulin resistance). However, this is not something that has been backed up by any solid evidence. To be clear, these diets don't necessarily have to consist solely of fat loss, but they do need to include good quality protein and carbs. For example:

You can read more about the science behind ketosis here.

What should I eat if I want to go into ketosis?

If you have Type 1 diabetes, you probably won't want to eat much carbohydrate at all. This means no breads or pastas, and certainly no potatoes. You're already severely restricting calories so you will see negative effects on weight loss. If you have Type 2, you may also benefit from reducing carb intake further as well. However, even those with Type 2 can still gain significant weight when eating carbohydrates, so it is important to eat a healthy balanced diet consisting of both fats and proteins to allow your body to utilize them properly without excess insulin production.

1. Physical Activity Can Reduce Mortality – Physical activity can reduce mortality rates by as much as 40% for older adults.

2. Regular Exercise May Improve Your Health – A moderate amount of regular exercise is linked with better overall health, lower risks of heart disease and diabetes, lower blood pressure, and decreased risk of death due to cancer and stroke.

3. Reducing Obesity Can Help You Live Longer – While obesity was thought to be an independent predictor of premature death, new research suggests it may actually play a role in prolonging life.

4. Physical Activity Is More Effective Than Drugs For Treating Diabetes – Most people with type 2 diabetes will need medical intervention at some point in their lives. People who are physically active and eat healthy foods tend to have lower incidence of complications when they do need insulin.

5. A Healthy Diet And Physical Inactivity Are Associated With Better Cognitive Performance – Older adults who engage in at least 150 minutes per week of aerobic activities or 150 minutes per week of vigorous exercise enjoy better cognitive performance than those who stay sedentary.

In addition to doing these exercises regularly you can incorporate some basic mobility drills with them as well.

What is the treatment for toxoplasmosis?

Toxoplasmosis is treated with a combination of medicines that include:

Drugs to prevent infection and to reduce symptoms (antibiotics)

Medications used to treat certain health problems such as arthritis, diabetes, heart disease and liver disease

Antifungal medications that can help prevent or treat infections caused by fungus

If you have not been previously treated for toxoplasmosis, your doctor will recommend that you take one of these drugs every day until your immune system has had enough time to work out how to destroy the parasite once it's been infected. The medication may be taken orally, given through an IV drip or injected into muscle, and lasts approximately four weeks. You are also advised to avoid eating raw or undercooked meat, fish, shellfish and eggs for at least two months after being treated so as not to pass on any parasites from them.

How do I know if my baby was born without congenital toxoplasmosis?

Some babies aren't born completely healthy due to defects in their development or because they were born prematurely. If this happens, there are ways to find out whether your baby has toxoplasmosis during routine screening. This information will allow your obstetrician/gynaecologist to decide what measures are needed to ensure he or she is free from toxoplasmosis.

Do pregnant women need to get tested for Toxoplasma gondii and other STDs?

Pregnant women should be screened regularly for toxoplasmosis throughout pregnancy. Screening includes taking a single blood sample at around 24-26 weeks gestation to measure levels of antibodies against toxoplasmosis and other diseases. Women who test positive for toxoplasmosis antibodies should receive further testing to confirm the diagnosis and make sure that all other risks associated with pregnancy remain well controlled. A total of five tests may be required depending on when the mother was last exposed to toxoplasmosis in her lifetime. There is no evidence that pregnant women who don't already have immunosuppressive conditions should undergo additional testing during pregnancy. However, women whose risk factors are known to increase their chances of exposure should consider testing anyway. For example, some people are more likely than others to become infected while having sex, so those who engage in unprotected vaginal sex might want to consider getting tested before giving birth.

They may find themselves having trouble sleeping because their body is constantly on alert. Some become so dependent on medication or other treatments that there's not much time left over for anything else. Increased risk of health problems related to MS – Certain risks associated with MS increase as people age. People with MS tend to have more frequent falls than the general population. They also tend to be at greater risk from certain infections like pneumonia. Because MS affects an area of the brain where nerve cells (neurons) communicate, this can lead to damage that damages nerves throughout the body. The resulting physical difficulties can include loss of vision, numbness and tingling on one side of your body, weakness, fatigue and cognitive issues such as memory loss.

In the new study, researchers found that low levels of vitamin B12 could lead to a reduction in brain health in mice by disrupting cell signaling pathways. The findings also suggest that this relationship between vitamin B12 deficiency and inflammation may be similar for people with MS and Alzheimer's disease, the team wrote in their paper published online July 15 in Science Translational Medicine.

gpt2-xl_54,"The answer to this question is that the most common form of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) results from an autoimmune process. The immune system attacks and destroys myelin, the fatty coating around nerves that helps them transmit signals properly. This damage causes a person with MS to have problems with their balance, movement, speech, vision or hearing. All of these symptoms can be debilitating and even deadly for some people. For others, MS affects only one body part – the brain. In fact, when you're diagnosed with MS, the doctors typically diagnose you based on a physical examination at your first appointment. The purpose of the exam is to rule out any other conditions that might cause your symptoms. If they find nothing else wrong, then they may tell you that you have MS and give you treatment guidelines. The important thing to remember about your initial evaluation at your doctor's office is that the exams are done so that the doctor knows what areas of your body need special attention. They also want to make sure there aren't any new health issues developing during the course of your disease.


What is the relationship between brain function and multiple sclerosis?

Multiple sclerosis occurs in almost exclusively women. According to National Institutes of Health research, 70-85 percent of MS patients are female. Women tend to develop more slowly than men do. While men are generally able to walk normally and drive a car without difficulty, women often lose their ability to use their legs after being diagnosed with MS. Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to experience episodes of numbness or tingling in their limbs. Symptoms of MS may range from mild to severe. The severity depends on how much tissue has been damaged within the nerve cells. There are many different types of MS, including: Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPM): An inflammation of the central nervous system that begins in the spinal cord and eventually affects all five of its major branches. PPM affects approximately 1/3 of women who get diagnosed with MS. Patients' muscles become weak and gradually weaken until they stop moving altogether. Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS): A type of MS characterized by symptoms such as muscle weakness, loss of coordination and loss of bladder control; however, unlike primary progressive MS, secondary progressive MS doesn't affect the whole body. It is rarer and less aggressive in women compared to men. Spinal cord injury: A traumatic event — like a car accident — that injures the spinal cord, causing nerve cell damage. Severe or repeated injuries can lead to permanent damage and loss",54,What does multiple sclerosis diagnosis include? What does it change?,-0.2596095502376556,50,no_prompt,3,0.2032520325203252,437,14

When Should I Call My Doctor?

Call your doctor if you think you might have a serious problem. You should be sure to get accurate information before making any decisions. Many young people don't call because they're afraid that something won't happen, but the truth is that even small changes can make all the difference in preventing future problems. If you do decide to see your doctor, make an appointment as soon as possible so you can discuss things like:

If you've been taking medication for a long time

Your specific medications

All your treatment plans

Any side effects, such as headaches, dizziness, low blood pressure, digestive issues or memory loss

Anything else that's going on that might affect your ability to take care of yourself.

What Kind of Treatment Will I Need?

There are many treatments available to treat mental illnesses. They may include psychotherapy, cognitive behavior therapy, family counseling and/or group support groups. The type of treatment used will depend on the cause of your mental illness and its severity. For example, some children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may require medication to control their symptoms, while others may benefit from therapy alone. Some treatments may involve weekly sessions over several months, while other methods may provide short-term relief. There are also some techniques for treating mental health issues that involve only one person, called ""one-on-one"" counseling. While this method isn't very effective for everyone, it has helped some adolescents who had difficulty coping with typical school activities.",52,What are the most common mental health problems?

How do you feel about people using their imagination to come up with ways to help men live better lives? Is there anything that's not possible or do you think that we need to work on more ways for men to get their needs met by other means than just a drug/solution to their problems?

I am in full support of all creative approaches to making men's health care easier. The only thing that makes me want to throw my hands up in frustration at times is when people put too much faith in some drugs to fix things.

Do you have any medical backgrounds or training in your field? If so, how did you learn it?

Yes. My background includes various forms of education as well as experience working on research projects involving mental health issues.

What's next for you? Any plans to move forward with research or pursue other avenues in the future? Do you have any other interests that could be pursued alongside your research?

As with most academic careers, I plan to continue pursuing research but also pursue other areas within academia. It was great to finish up my PhD earlier this year and begin applying for jobs after graduation. As far as my next career steps go, nothing has been set in stone yet.

A team led by University of Edinburgh neuroscientist Professor Paul McGlashan, the lead author on the study published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal, looked at a group of people with Borderline Personality Disorder who had previously been diagnosed as having antisocial tendencies. They asked them to complete various tasks which measured how well they could inhibit their impulse to act. It is important to note that these measures are not designed to measure how much you like something – but rather whether your brain switches off the urge to do it. This is known as the 'impulsive switch' or 'inhibition system'. These individuals were found to have an abnormally high level of activity in this area, suggesting that they were more likely to be impulsive and aggressive than other participants. What's more, the researchers found that the extra activation in the impulsivity switch was associated with increased levels of testosterone in men, and decreased testosterone in women.

The results may explain why people with Borderline Personality Disorder report feeling more angry when they feel rejected. As part of their experiment, McGlashan and his colleagues recruited 19 men (mean age 36) from two separate groups: 12 were members of a support group for those suffering from BPD and 9 were participants in a control condition where they weren't given any information about BPD. Each participant then completed a series of tasks to measure their impulsiveness, anger sensitivity, and depression.

When compared with controls who didn't receive any treatment, these participants reported feeling more angry, more often felt depressed, and had higher levels of anxiety as well. All of these changes seemed to correlate with lower levels of testosterone in both men and women.

""Our findings suggest that there may be some biological basis for how BPD affects individuals,"" said McGlashan. ""It may be that people with BPD experience heightened feelings of anger, hostility and frustration and this might trigger changes in hormone production.""

In light of these findings, McGlashan believes further research into the effects of medication on hormone levels should be conducted. He also suggests that interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy might help patients reduce their risk of being violent.

The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between MS activity in the brain and changes in serotonin (5-HT), dopamine, norepinephrine, and glutamate concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with active disease. Serum samples were obtained from 18 patients who had been diagnosed as having primary progressive MS at baseline; 12 patients with relapsed or secondary progressive MS; 11 controls without MS and 14 people with other neurologic diseases. Patients who had received at least 2 doses of methylphenidate within 3 months before data collection were excluded from analysis. The results showed that levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), which is an indicator of neuronal damage, did not differ significantly between patients with active disease and controls. However, differences were found between patients with active and untreated disease in serum levels of serotonin, noradrenaline, dopamine, and glutamate. Although treatment with 5-HIAA was associated with greater reductions in serum levels of these neurotransmitters, there were no significant effects on clinical markers of progression.

The association between MS and serotonin has long been well known. Previous studies have shown reduced serotonin metabolism in MS subjects, but it remains unknown whether this reduces 5-HT production. Serotonin may also mediate some of the symptoms seen during MS relapse, suggesting a role for 5-HT in mediating many of the conditions thought to be associated with MS such as fatigue, pain, sleep disturbances, depression, cognitive impairment, and mobility disability.

While previous work using animal models suggests that increased 5-HT transmission through the 5-HT1a receptor contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration [7], no direct evidence exists to support this hypothesis in humans. In addition, pharmacological manipulation of serotonin levels has resulted in only limited efficacy in treating MS [8]. Recently, 5-HT2 antagonists are being developed for use in treating MS [9], yet their effectiveness has not been tested in human clinical trials. Given the emerging interest in developing therapies that target 5-HT pathways and neuroplasticity, we examined whether treatments targeting 5-HT signaling would alter MS pathology and its symptomatology. Our goal was therefore to determine whether 5-HT abnormalities might impact on MS-related pathological features and behavioral response in humans.

I'm interested in learning about this information because I have experienced it myself when I've tried to stop using heroin. I am a recovering addict, but there are days that I feel like I am ""on the edge"" of relapse again after a period of being clean for months. There is no doubt in my mind that the number one reason why someone with an addiction will attempt suicide is if they cannot get out of their drug of choice. And as far as I can tell from reading about these cases, most of them do not end up dying. Some of the statistics include:

A total of 38 people killed by an opioid overdose since 2007, including 17 children

The average age of death was 43

An estimated 70% of deaths were due to unintentional overdoses of opioids

14% of all deaths were associated with opioids prescribed to treat conditions such as cancer or HIV/AIDS

About 10% of all deaths were linked to synthetic opioids

More than half of those who die of an opioid overdose are male, with an average age of 46. Among female users, the median age was 28 years old

From 2010 to 2015, a total of 474,000 Americans became addicted to prescription drugs. Of those individuals, 63 percent reported abusing a pharmaceutical or nonprescription pain reliever. Another 32 percent abused stimulants, and another 19 percent used sedatives/hypnotics

In 2016, approximately 12.4 million Americans took at least one prescription painkiller, which led to an additional 34,200 emergency room visits related to this problem

Prescription drug overdose is now more common than auto accidents (which account for less than 2 million annual U.S. traffic fatalities), and the rate per 100,000 people continues to rise

In other words, this study shows that the cause of the fatigue is not related to brain function or myelin but instead relates to the mechanical activity within the muscle fiber itself and not the nerve fibers themselves. The authors did find a small correlation between fatigue and inflammation (which was also found in previous studies), however it seems that this could be due to the fact that they used different blood tests to measure inflammation which may have caused bias against the inflammatory markers. However, there were still enough differences in these results that more research needs to be done before any conclusions can be made about inflammation or brain fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, while the current evidence does not support the idea that there are abnormal metabolites being produced by immune cells in response to inflammation, it is possible that there may be some abnormalities within the nervous system as well, such as elevated levels of C-reactive protein and elevated autoantibody titers.

You'll find a description of symptoms, along with their causes and treatments at the bottom. The guide is divided into sections on 'brain', 'eye' and'skin'.

Here's a summary of what you need to know about the neurological problems that cause multiple sclerosis – and how they're treated:

Multiple sclerosis is caused by damage to the nervous system in the brain and spinal cord. This affects people's ability to control their movement, feel pain or sense touch.

Many other conditions can also affect the central nervous system, but no one exactly knows why these two areas are particularly vulnerable to nerve cell death.

Some types of multiple sclerosis (MS) result from damage to blood vessels that supply the nerves with oxygen and nutrients. Others develop when immune cells destroy part of the lining of the spinal fluid (endothelium).

Nerve cell degeneration can be triggered by certain infections, infection of the skin (dermatitis herpetiformis), smoking and certain drugs like alcohol. It usually happens slowly over years; some cases, however, become life-threatening.

There are different kinds of multiple sclerosis, which describe each type of damage as well as treatment options. Some patients may require more than one kind of medicine to manage their symptoms.

Methods Patients with SPMS were recruited from April 2007 to August 2010 at seven medical centres in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom: Braunschweig University Hospital, Erlangen, Germany; Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands; Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany; Würzburg Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany; Freiburg University Hospital, Freiberg, Germany; Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, The Netherlands; and Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, USA. A total of 797 cases were included in this analysis. All patients aged 25–55 years were enrolled in the study. Baseline clinical data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Clinical variables included age, sex, disease duration, baseline disability index, baseline neurological examination score, and baseline SPMS activity index scores. Results of multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that the following factors significantly predicted SPMS progression over time: patient's age (P < 0.001), gender (P = 0.002), disease duration (P = 0.01), presence of an SPMS lesion on MRI prior to enrollment (P = 0.02), and high-grade gliomas (P = 0.02). There was no significant association between disease duration or brain imaging abnormalities and SPMS relapse. The results are discussed below.

Results Fifty-four (5%) of the 797 patients had experienced a full-blown diagnosis of SPMS. Table 1 summarizes the demographic and clinical features of the study population. The mean (SD) age of all SPMS patients was 43 (15) years. Of these patients, 48% (n = 511) had been diagnosed before their first hospitalization for the condition.

gpt2-xl_93,"Sleep is a complex process that involves many physiological systems, including the brain. Several studies have found links between sleep disturbances and MS. The findings suggest there may be an association of disturbed sleep with MS, but further research is needed. The National Sleep Foundation recommends seven or more hours of restful sleep per night for everyone over 50 years old, although most older adults do not achieve this standard.

The question you ask is really a matter of interpretation and assessment. If your patient has had a recent episode of sleep disruption, it might be appropriate to ask about possible underlying medical factors that could account for their difficulty falling asleep (e.g., depression). This should only be done with the patient's permission if they are unable to get up in the middle of the night when asked or otherwise feel unwell and unable to stay awake at night. In general, patients who report insomnia due to MS often also suffer from other conditions such as depression and anxiety, which can make them difficult to manage and manage well.

For instance, a person suffering from chronic low mood is likely to have trouble staying motivated to go to work or school or feel depressed. Many people report having difficulties getting up in the morning; others struggle to keep the lights on all day and are exhausted after waking up late each evening. These changes in behaviour will interfere with sleep patterns. So, asking your patient whether they have experienced sleep problems related to MS may reveal some underlying issues that need addressing in order to improve sleep quality.

""The idea that you're born with one disease is not accurate,"" said study co-author Michael Hirsch, MD, director of the Center for Genomic Medicine in the Department of Dermatology and Vascular Surgery at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland. ""You can get many different diseases from having this single gene.""

In fact, those who carry a certain variant of the MS gene have about twice as much risk of developing more than two additional autoimmune diseases, compared to those who do not. This means that someone might be prone to developing multiple sclerosis, for example, but then face an even greater risk of getting RA and lupus later on down the road.

These new findings, published today in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, will help researchers better understand how genes affect the development of multiple sclerosis, and ultimately lead them to better treatments for those affected by these devastating autoimmune diseases.

""Understanding the pathophysiology of these disorders helps us design new drugs and therapies, such as immunosuppressants that target specific genes or immune stimulation strategies targeting some key proteins associated with inflammation and autoimmunity,"" Dr. Hirsch explained. ""As we learn more about how each type of autoimmune disorder develops, it may also open the way for us to identify biological markers related to susceptibility, so clinicians could monitor patients' health status over time to determine whether they are likely to develop any particular disorder.

Dr. Hirsch is also chief of dermatologic surgery at University Hospitals Case Medical Center. He and his colleagues studied the genetics of the MS gene on chromosome 16p13.1, which contains over 500 genes, making it the most common MS locus. They used genome-wide SNP genotyping techniques to compare the DNA sequences between those who had MS and those who did not. A total of 1,005 people were included in the research.

The study focused only on those with no family history of MS or rheumatoid arthritis. They determined that the most common MS-linked variants involved MS genes involved in the production of the peptide interleukin-10 (IL-10), which regulates cell growth and function, and IL-2, which plays a role in controlling inflammatory processes.

How To Do This: Lie on your stomach, legs straight up and relaxed. Keeping them that way, slowly lift your chest as far as possible. Try not to hold yourself there. Keep trying to push outwards towards your toes. As soon as you can feel yourself starting to get some range of motion at your sternum (where your rib cage begins), start pushing up. Start by holding one hand down in front of you (so it's resting against your abdomen) then slowly move your arm forward, letting go of the grip once your chest is at full extension. You'll know your chest has reached its maximum when you feel a slight pull in your bellybutton. If this doesn't happen, keep going until you're able to do each rep without any pain whatsoever!

Doing this exercise will help strengthen your abdominal muscles and give you a nice round look with no fat attached. The lower section of your ribs are really important because they support all your internal organs and carry their own blood supply. When we have an injury or strain to these muscles, our organs simply cannot function properly. Without it, serious health issues such as heart disease, stroke, or even cancer may develop.

According to a recent report by The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the current UK food system is failing on all three counts:

Nutrition

Product safety

Cost

The EFSA's analysis, based on 17 years of research, concludes that ""the UK food supply system is not fit for purpose.""

To understand what this means, it helps to think about food as a whole — from seed through to shelf-stable foods. A healthy diet for individuals requires a balance between nutrients and micronutrients such as vitamins, minerals and essential fatty acids. These are found naturally in foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds; but too much or too little of any one nutrient can affect how we feel, feel like, react to stress or cope with illness. For example, high intakes of sodium can lead to hypertension, while dietary fibre has been shown to reduce the risk of developing diabetes.

Unfortunately, our food system isn't designed to provide these balanced nutrients. It has evolved over thousands of years to meet the needs of people in isolated parts of the globe living in harsh conditions where there wasn't the time or resources to grow their own food. This meant that when people moved to cities, they were forced to eat processed, highly concentrated, low nutrition meals made up largely of sugar, salt and oil. This led to many developing chronic diseases which, as the World Health Organisation notes, may be caused by our poor diets alone. Obesity, heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes and many other health problems have also emerged because people haven't had enough variety in the food they eat.

We've already started down a very slippery slope towards an epidemic of obesity in the UK. In 2015, more than 1.3 million Britons aged 16 and older were classed obese. There was an additional 700,000 adults classified as overweight, although experts estimate that around 60 per cent of them will gain weight back at some point during their life. By 2050, obesity rates will double.

This isn't just affecting children either. One study published last year showed that women who didn't drink alcohol before pregnancy could pass on a significantly increased risk of miscarriage later in their lives. They're also far less likely to conceive if they don't start drinking before going into early puberty. This suggests that pregnant women should consider limiting themselves to no more than one or two drinks a week, which includes wine or beer.

Then we'll examine some of the ways that therapy can be beneficial—for both the patient and therapist. We'll look at ways you might use therapy in your own life. And lastly, we'll discuss how to find a therapist who will help you achieve your goals and reach your dreams!

The History of Psychotherapy

Like medicine, psychology developed gradually over time from ancient times up through the 20th century. In fact, most doctors did not even recognize medicine as an ""art"" until much later. Psychology was born out of the desire to understand and treat human behavior. It grew out of Freud's ideas about psychoanalysis and behavioral therapy; Kertbeny began researching the field during the early 1900s; and the American Psychiatric Association formally recognized mental illness in 1952.

Early psychologists were called mentalists, after the Greek term meaning ""mind-maker."" They studied how people thought and acted, and often used clinical observation to determine why people behaved in certain ways. As with psychiatry, these practices became more scientific as they gained legitimacy.

But one day an anonymous letter arrived in Kertbeny's office titled ""An Open Letter on the Treatment of Mental Illness by Psychoanalytic Methodology,"" which was written by Thomas Szasz, a medical doctor, writer, and psychiatrist from Budapest, Hungary. His words were shocking because he said that his profession was based on the assumption that all mental disorders could be cured. He felt that psychiatrists had been misled into thinking they knew everything there was to know about mental health. By now, every schoolchild in America had heard that schizophrenia resulted from abnormal brain chemistry caused by environmental insults such as abuse or poverty. This idea came from Freud himself, but he never explained exactly how this happened or exactly when it should occur.

Szasz argued that, given sufficient knowledge, patients could also get better through treatment, and that it would take years before any diagnosis or drug was necessary. But if one diagnosed someone with a disorder without trying to correct their problems, then it wasn't possible to learn anything useful, especially because each person would have unique experiences and",53,what is psychotherapy?,-1.998332381248474,15,no_prompt,3,0.08333333333333333,404,1

How much is needed? The amount needed depends on your overall health and on how much you have consumed before. You may need more than the recommended dose. If you are taking metformin, talk with your doctor about what to expect when you stop taking it.

If you are taking metformin, tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, minerals and herbal supplements. Also tell them if you take any other medicines, because some medicines can increase the effects of metformin.

The following information is from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), a program that collects drug abuse statistics for use by public health officials throughout the United States:

There were an estimated 3.7 million patients treated for drug addiction in 2005. About 1 in 10 patients who receive treatment for drug dependence continues using drugs without receiving help during treatment, often after completion of treatment. This means that at least one out of five people who received treatment for their drug problem will continue using after completing treatment. Approximately 50% of those who receive treatment for drug dependence relapse within three months of starting treatment.

In April 2010, more than 462,000 adults aged 18 years or older were reported to be abusing or dependent upon alcohol or illicit drugs such as cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, hallucinogens and marijuana; approximately 80% of these individuals had used alcohol or drugs before. Among substance abusers who participated in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health in 2007–2008, the most common reasons given for having a drink or using illegal drugs was that they felt ""high"" or ""stoned,"" or to cope with stress. In addition to the increased use of alcohol and other substances, there has also been a significant rise in binge drinking since 2004. It is important to note that heavy drinking can lead to serious physical problems and can impair judgment, decision making, coordination and reactions. Heavy drinking causes many people to experience temporary changes in moods, behavior and perception. People who regularly consume high quantities of alcohol tend to develop symptoms associated with depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, liver damage, and sometimes even death.

The authors suggest there could be a number of reasons for this difference, including differences in method choice and use and patient education.

What is known about the link between contraception and infertility?

Contraception can affect fertility by increasing the risk of getting pregnant (contraceptive failure), or causing an unintended pregnancy to end before it starts (miscarriage). This is usually due to the woman having used contraception incorrectly.

While many women have a good response when their contraceptive fails, others do not respond as well. For example, women who choose not to take any contraception may experience irregular periods because they are unable to keep up with their monthly cycle. Other women may have more difficult deliveries due to changes in hormone levels caused by contraceptive failure. Some people may also find that regular sex means that their ovaries stop working properly, which increases the chances of getting pregnant again in future.

It has been estimated that contraceptive failures cause around 3% of pregnancies among couples using modern methods. In addition, approximately 1 million women suffer from pre-eclampsia - a condition where the placenta becomes too thick and causes severe bleeding during pregnancy. If left untreated, pre-eclampsia can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, and even death.

In 2011, WHO published new estimates of the total global burden attributable to unsafe abortion. It estimated that unsafe abortions account for 5% of all maternal deaths worldwide.

How does this study compare with previous research?

Previous studies into the association between contraceptive failure and fertility outcomes have relied heavily on self-reported data. A recent review of these and other available studies found evidence suggesting a possible relationship between contraceptive failure and spontaneous abortion or ectopic pregnancy but concluded that it should be treated with caution given the large number of reported cases of both spontaneous abortion and ectopic pregnancy in studies across multiple countries over time.

This study builds upon prior work by using a more accurate measure of contraceptive failure: hormonal contraception failed. Researchers measured how often the hormones involved in contraception - like the combination pill, the injectable progestogen IUD and implants - stopped being effective after 12 months. They compared the rates of spontaneous abortions, ectopic pregnancies and still births in women who were using different types of contraception at the start of the study period.

They then adjusted the results to account for differences in factors associated with fertility problems. These included age, socioeconomic status,",126,birth control suppression antral follicle count,-12.750259399414062,69,no_prompt,3,0.5897435897435898,422,0

pulmonary embolism pulmonary fibrosis polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (POTS), also known as PCOS, is a group of conditions in which the ovaries produce too many male hormones. It can affect up to 10 percent of women between the ages of 15 and 35, but it affects about 3-5 percent of men. Some forms of PCOS are hereditary, while others may be caused by lifestyle factors or medical problems. Certain drugs that treat high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease can increase your risk for developing PCOS. High-fiber diets help lower cholesterol levels and improve insulin sensitivity. They can also make you more likely to have type 2 diabetes and other health complications associated with obesity.

Q: What's happening to my body?

A: Your liver, pancreas, muscles, bones, nerves, and kidneys are being affected, among other things. You might experience fatigue, weight gain, headaches, irregular or poor menstrual periods, constipation, anemia, muscle aches, skin problems like acne, rashes, hives, dry skin, eczema, and psoriasis, changes in vision, hair loss, depression, anxiety, nervousness, memory loss, trouble sleeping, low sex drive, and difficulty concentrating.

Your kidneys will start to work less efficiently because your adrenal glands aren't producing enough of their normal hormone cortisol. When this happens, fluid from your urine builds up in your body and increases urination. This condition is called overhydration. Over time, dehydration can lead to swelling of the legs, feet, ankles, arms, hands, face, lips, stomach, and intestines. In severe cases, it could cause life-threatening organ failure. Signs and symptoms include:

Nausea

Vomiting

Diarrhea

Fever

Anxiety

gpt2-xl_83,"How can you be sure if it's just another bad case of MS, or a real and dangerous disease that needs to be treated with drugs?

The first thing you need to know is that there are different types of MS. There are relapses and non-relapses. Relapse happens when the immune system mistakenly attacks your nerve cells, causing permanent damage that can be difficult to correct. Non-relapse, on the other hand, occurs without any warning signs. The symptoms in this category include numbness and tingling in some areas of your body, loss of muscle strength, pain, weakness, fatigue, sleep problems, mood swings, difficulty concentrating and more. You may have seen patients like this before, but they're not all relapsed MS.

How do doctors diagnose MS?

When you see someone who has been diagnosed as having relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), you'll probably hear a lot about their illness from their health care provider. This is part of their job: making sure that you're getting the right treatment for your condition, even though you might feel uncertain about what's happening. They want to make sure you get the right medicine — specifically immunosuppressant medications — at the right time so that you don't lose too much control over your condition. In most cases, these treatments last between two to four weeks; sometimes they will take longer.

In general, doctors say they give you three to five months to recover from relapses. But in reality, that is often insufficient, especially during your worst periods. So doctors may prescribe an additional course of medication after you've had several good days of improvement. After several months, they usually recommend going back to your primary doctor, who can review your records again and decide whether you should be further examined. If you still have trouble with your mobility, your neurologist might suggest surgery. Another option is that you could try to keep active and participate in physical therapy.

What are the risks of being diagnosed with RRMS?

Although relapses are relatively common, many people never go through one. Others experience relapses every few years, while others can stay well into adulthood and beyond. When someone becomes ill, doctors are trained to treat them as soon as possible, including starting treatment immediately after an initial visit. However, you are also responsible for yourself. And there can be serious complications related to the diseases of old age such as stroke or dementia.

You can get medical leave from your employer if you have multiple sclerosis, as long as you are working at least 20 hours per week for an employer that is not a government agency or the U.S. Postal Service.

It includes time off work due to illness or injury while on FMLA leave and also time when you take disability leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Please note: If your current job does not permit employees to accrue family leave days or if your company has policies that do not allow you to take FMLA leave, you may qualify for another type of leave, such as sick pay, vacation, or personal days. For more information about qualifying for other types of leave, please see our page on Employee Benefits.

I have MS and am going into my fifth year of treatment. Are there any restrictions on me getting employment?

Employers must give you reasonable notice before they will consider you for a change in position unless it is necessary to make a bona fide personnel decision (i.e., to maintain the effectiveness of existing staffing levels), and you meet all other qualification requirements for promotion, transfer, reassignment, etc. The same rules apply to returning workers who return after having left their last job because of their illnesses. For example, employers cannot exclude you from consideration for new positions until you complete your first 12 weeks of qualified coverage.

If I'm eligible for FMLA leave, is this available to my spouse/partner? Do I need to be in the same household as my wife/partner?

No. In order to receive FMLA benefits, you must be able to show that you meet both of the following conditions:

You must be the employee's primary caretaker for four weeks during a 30 consecutive calendar month period. Your primary caregiver may include either spouse, registered domestic partner or former spouse. A child who is part of your relationship with the employee may be treated as your primary caregiver, even though he or she may live with his or her parent(s) or legal guardian. An employee who leaves their job for one or two months but returns to work without taking FMLA leave does not qualify as a ""primary caregiver.""

It can be difficult to make sense of what is happening to you if you're not aware of your condition, so try to be open and honest with your doctor.

During these times (from approximately December through February), your body produces enough endometrial lining to create an egg every month, but then has trouble getting this ""egg"" from your ovary into your uterus because there is too much mucus present on the outside of your womb. The average woman has about 1 year of active fertility at any given time during her reproductive life. This means that by age 30, roughly half of all fertile women will no longer be able to get pregnant due to medical reasons.

The majority of women experience menopause between ages 40 and 50. Some experts believe that the majority of women do not experience menstruation until around age 60 or 70. According to Dr. Puhl, most people don't know how long they actually have been menstruating, because as we age, the uterine lining gets thinner and starts shedding, leaving us feeling less full after eating foods high in fiber. Many women with MS also report having irregular periods for several months post-menopause, while others do not experience such issues. However, some women experience problems with their period as early as the first 3 years post-diagnosis, so talk with your health care professional about whether you are experiencing problems or not.

Frequently Asked Questions About Shingles

What is Shingles?

Shingles, also called herpes zoster, is a painful rash caused by the reactivation of dormant virus in your body. There are two types of shingles:

Herpes zoster. This disease causes small blisters that erupt on one side of the body first. The rash will appear as red-brown spots with raised dots at the center. They may be raised and wrinkled or smooth and flat. After five days, they usually fade away.

They may be raised and wrinkled or smooth and flat. After five days, they usually fade away. Herpetic neuralgia. This disorder can cause blisters and/or an area of raised scar tissue called nodules above the joint where a nerve root enters the spinal cord. It has no symptoms.


How Common Is Shingles?

The incidence of shingles varies from year to year but it can affect anywhere from 2% to 20%.

Does Everyone Get Shingles?

No, not everyone who gets shingles develops a fever, rash, or other signs and symptoms. When you get shingles, about 1 in 4 people who do develop a rash will have fever. However, this is only true if you are exposed to the disease.

Can I Stop Getting Shingles?

Most likely not. The immune system can still recognize certain viruses as being dangerous, such as flu, hepatitis C, or HIV, even after you stop having contact with them. For example, after you've had regular contact with these diseases, it's possible to become infected again.

In addition to its skin benefits, the plant contains essential oils such as juniper and lavender which are known for their soothing qualities and anti-inflammatory properties. For these reasons, it is often used in aromatherapy and also traditionally used to treat skin ailments including: headaches, bronchitis, asthma, depression, anxiety, arthritis, etc. It has been found that tea made from Echinacea can help prevent or relieve symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.

The leaves of Echinacea contain high levels of a chemical called eugenol which is an alkaloid. This substance is very beneficial to our health since it helps us metabolize food and maintain good blood circulation and can reduce inflammation on our body's surface. Echinacea's ability to lower the body's temperature and increase energy is due to this substance's ability to regulate internal temperatures by controlling respiration and reducing stress hormones.

Echinacea also possesses natural antibacterial effects and may be used to heal wounds or infections because of the many benefits it offers. One study conducted in Italy compared Echinacea with two other common remedies for cuts and burns. Both drugs had no effect on healing rate while Echinacea completely prevented scarring from cutaneous infections. In another study done in Israel, 30 patients were given either a daily dose of 0.5 milligrams of echinacea or placebo for 10 days. A control group was administered only a sugar pill without any added herbal ingredients at all. The researchers noted significant reductions in pain, swelling and redness, as well as healing of deep wounds.

To ensure safety of using Echinacea for your treatment of illness, it should always be kept in a cool dry place away from sunlight. It should not be taken if you have gastrointestinal problems or are pregnant or nursing. If you suspect you might have a medicinal condition affecting the liver, please consult your doctor before taking Echinacea.

A few years ago, the FDA restricted Echinacea imports from China due to concerns about possible harm to consumers. However, there is hope that those restrictions will soon be lifted. Currently, the FDA regulates imported products containing herbs, botanicals, vitamins and dietary supplements and does not specifically oversee the importation of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Despite the fact that it is illegal to bring imported herbs into the U.S., we are confident that more than enough companies will continue importing Chinese herbs legally so long as they comply with FDA standards and do",132,headpats scalp psoriasis,-12.53209400177002,106,no_prompt,4,0.848,405,0

When can you stop taking this drug? If your doctor has prescribed it, he or she should tell you when it's time to stop. This is called an interval schedule and the dose will be gradually decreased over weeks, months and years until the treatment stops. It may take up to four weeks for all symptoms of MS to resolve completely. Once you have fully recovered from the first episode of MS, your doctor may increase the dosage slowly.

This medication is also used in other conditions where there is a risk of nerve damage. For example, people who smoke should not use this medicine. You might need a prescription from your physician before starting therapy with oral corticosteroids. Talk to your health care provider about any side effect(s) that you experience during your treatment with oral corticosteroid medication.

What happens if I miss a dose?

Take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not double the dose to catch up because some medicines must be taken at specific times.

Do not take 2 doses at once. Take 1 extra dose at the usual time each day.

Why does this medication affect certain hormones?

The hormone progesterone acts on many parts of the body to help regulate pregnancy and menopause. Corticosteroids help control inflammation by controlling levels of immune-related proteins called cytokines. They work by reducing production of these proteins. These medications usually do not change how much progesterone is made. However, they may make hormone receptors in certain cells (antigen receptors), which cause them to release more cytokines than normal. The higher levels of cytokines that result may be associated with the development of autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis. Some people who take corticosteroids for short periods of time during pregnancy develop premature labor. The most common side effect of corticosteroid therapy is increased uterine bleeding during childbirth; however, this can occur even in women treated with low doses. In rare cases, very high doses of steroid medication may lead to birth defects such as spina bifida. Your health care provider will monitor you carefully when you are pregnant and after giving birth so that they can rule out potential problems. If you think that you may be pregnant while being treated with oral steroids, talk with your healthcare provider immediately.

Is there a cure for Multiple Sclerosis (MS)? If so, what treatments are available?

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system attacks its own nervous system. There are two main types of MS: relapsing-remitting (RRM), and secondary progressive (SP). RRM is characterized by flare-ups, often with severe pain, fatigue, weakness, numbness or tingling in parts of your brain and spinal cord that control movement. SP affects people over 50 years old, usually slowly but sometimes painfully. It can have no obvious physical symptoms, such as muscle stiffness. It starts off like SP, but over time you may get worse symptoms and eventually lose your ability to walk or speak, or develop other problems. For more information about the three forms of MS, visit our Fact Sheet on the four basic types of multiple sclerosis.

Do children with MS have seizures? Are they at increased risk of other neurologic diseases later in life?

Yes. Children who begin to show signs of MS in their early teens and remain symptomatic into adulthood tend to be diagnosed with RRM rather than SP. Seizures are a common feature of both RRM and SP, although they occur less frequently during SP. However, this does not mean that children without seizures do not experience other neurological problems, particularly as they grow older. Many kids and young adults with MS experience other symptoms that make them feel very different from others. They may also suffer from depression, irritability, difficulty concentrating, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorders, or substance abuse. Because some symptoms of MS may appear differently between subtypes, it is important to learn how to distinguish between SP and RRM before trying to manage any of these conditions independently. For more information about epilepsy, visit the Epilepsy Foundation.


Are there treatment options for patients with MS?

There are currently no proven therapies for treating MS, nor is there a drug approved to treat it. Currently there are several medications used to slow or stop disease progression. These include corticosteroids for SP and interferon beta for RRM.

Corticosteroids are used to reduce swelling and inflammation in the muscles and joints, which causes the disability associated with MS.

The research also revealed that the bacteria in the gut can influence mood and behavior, possibly by influencing brain function such as learning and memory. This is because the immune system of the body is responsible for combating the harmful effects of microbial products – including those produced by certain types of intestinal bacteria. In fact, there are numerous studies which show a link between the presence of certain gut bacteria and depression. This has led researchers to believe that an imbalance between the resident microbiota within the human intestine and the innate bacterial flora is one possible cause of the condition. The results from this study suggest that alterations in the composition of the microbiome could play a part in the development of schizophrenia.

""We now know that it's not just our brains which get affected by the microbes we ingest every day,"" said the lead researcher, Dr. Sze Wang from the University of Cambridge.

However, if you have the condition more than 20 years before your symptoms begin, an earlier diagnosis may help protect you from complications and make treatment easier. As long as there are no other causes for your symptoms, early testing can be helpful to determine how serious your illness is and whether further tests might be needed.

How do doctors diagnose MS?

Doctors perform several different kinds of diagnostic tests and procedures to confirm the diagnosis. These may include: Blood test: This lets them see if antibodies called beta-amyloid proteins build up in your body. Researchers think this process may play a role in causing memory loss, seizures and other neurological problems. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): A CT scan shows a picture of the inside of your head. This image helps show where damage occurs, for instance in areas that control movement and thinking skills.

A growing number of studies have shown the effectiveness of this approach. The National Institute of Health (NIH) has stated: ""The evidence demonstrates significant improvements with a combination of lifestyle changes, dietary interventions, and psychosocial therapies.""

Although the term ""holistic"" may not have been around before the 1970s, the concept of ""holistic health"" emerged during the last decade of the 19th century when physicians began using the term to describe their medical practices. By using this label, they were able to refer to a group of health care providers who shared common principles — such as prevention and early detection — based on careful examination and analysis of individuals' bodies, rather than relying solely on clinical tests. In fact, many medical schools still use this terminology today.

While there was no formal definition at first, physicians soon recognized that certain aspects of traditional and alternative medicine would benefit patients but lacked scientific proof and/or were dangerous or ineffective in treating specific conditions. The term ""holistic"" refers specifically to those approaches that are rooted in natural science and offer real solutions to human problems through physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, or other means.

What are some examples of holistic health care in practice?

Holistic health centers exist everywhere from suburban backyards to large urban hospitals. Some provide treatments such as acupuncture, chiropractic adjustment, homeopathy, massage therapy, nutrition counseling, nutritional supplements, yoga, meditation, reiki, tai chi, deep breathing, reflexology, body work, and more, while others focus on the promotion of social connections or the healing power of plants, minerals, herbs, crystals, minerals, and more.

I am a physician working at an academic health center, and I have an interesting question about MS. My colleagues have a lot of experience treating patients with MS who have had major traumatic brain injuries (TBI). The most common problem is damage to the optic nerve. This damage can occur when a person is knocked down or falls from a high place; it's called a concussion. Other symptoms include headaches, loss of vision, dizziness, disorientation, nausea, vomiting, weakness or numbness, tingling in parts of the body, depression, memory problems, changes in personality, difficulty speaking and understanding speech, anxiety, concentration difficulties, sleep disturbances, blurred vision, seizures, lack of coordination, and more. In some cases, people with severe TBI can lose their ability to walk. Some of these patients may never regain that mobility again, while others may be able to walk but will need to use a wheelchair for many years afterward. If you're considering treatment for your own TBI, please read my article ""Should You Get Treatment?""

""I've been doing this for about a year now,"" says Valsamma, who's the founder of Deep Learning for Video (DVTV) in Bangalore. ""We have about 200 videos that we are currently using to train our model."" He believes that DVTV is going to revolutionize video analysis. In particular, it can provide new insights into how people interact with video content. For example, he has used it to identify certain features, such as faces or gestures, which would be useful for social media and other online applications.

When I say my heart was pounding when I saw the screen of this computer vision program, it isn't entirely inaccurate. My eyes were glued to it like a hawk's gaze when watching videos on Facebook Live. It wasn't because I had never seen what the algorithm could do; I just hadn't encountered it before. To understand how powerful AI has become in recent years, you need to look no further than the latest smartphone app, Facebook Messenger. As one of its earliest users, I've experienced first-hand how much artificial intelligence can improve your experience with messaging apps. It can help filter out spam messages, improve readability, and even create beautiful videos. In short, AI can make everything better—but only if you give it permission.

To test the limits of his system, Valsamma began by training it on hundreds of thousands of images from YouTube. The next step is to build an AI that will learn the nuances of each photo based on its original context. That's where he'll get the real challenge: How does one teach a machine to recognize something so complex? There are many methods available. One popular approach uses deep neural networks, and this is the method Dinesh Narayanan, PhD, of Stanford University chose after being inspired by Google's AlphaGo team at South Korea's Gachon university.

Using these models, Narayanan showed me two examples: A woman's face on top of a pile of paper, and a person wearing a suit sitting at a desk.

The first image shows an interesting situation: The woman is smiling while the man is at work. This may seem very natural, but there are some things to consider. First of all, it doesn't show him using his hands. Secondly, the photo wasn't taken standing up straight, making her appear taller than she actually is.

MMS is not a cure for MS, but it can be used as an adjunct therapy for people with the disease.

The treatment may also help ease the pain associated with MS.

How MMS works

You may have heard that a liquid form of MMS called Exsero is effective in treating MS symptoms. But what exactly does MMS do? And are there any side effects?

What is MMS?

MMS (melamine monohydrate) is a medical product made from salt water and magnesium sulfate. It's been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which means you can buy it without a prescription.

It was originally developed as a treatment for cystic fibrosis. The FDA says the chemical compounds in melamine work on the same mechanism as certain other drugs — namely blocking toxic substances produced during the process of breaking down collagen in your body. Melamine also kills bacteria and viruses.

Melamine may also reduce or eliminate inflammation in the joints, skin, and heart muscles.

When taken orally, MMS causes no known side effects. When given intravenously, it causes gastrointestinal irritation and possibly vomiting. In high doses, however, MMS can cause serious and life-threatening problems.

According to research done at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, MMS may cause:

Kidney failure

Nausea

Irritation of the bladder

In rare cases, kidney damage has resulted in death. This occurs when someone who takes too much MMS consumes too large quantities over time.

Most people should avoid taking higher amounts than prescribed because they could lead to significant health complications.

Who uses MMS?

People with multiple sclerosis are treated differently based on their disease severity. Some take oral medications like prednisone or interferon, while others use muscle relaxers or anti-inflammatory medication. People with less severe forms of the disease may take different combinations of these treatments.

Some experts say MMS might even be more helpful for some patients compared to traditional therapies such as steroids. Others disagree.

One study found that about 40 percent of MS patients using oral steroids showed improvement in fatigue. Of those treated with MMS, only 20 percent experienced relief from fatigue. However, several studies suggest that MMS reduces the duration of fatigue and makes people feel better overall.

Although MMS is generally safe, serious side effects have been",68,List of multiple sclerosis symptoms,-8.89577865600586,154,no_prompt,4,0.6968325791855203,384,11

(2) A physician must report a case of MS to the department if:

(a) The patient meets any of the following criteria for an eligible individual; or

(b) At least one person in the household has been diagnosed with MS and has not received treatment within the past year.

In a recent study using rat models, it was reported that treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug doxorubicin markedly inhibited the clinical development of MS in mice.2 Although the mechanism by which doxorubicin inhibits MS activity remains unknown, it may involve inhibition of the cell cycle as well as down regulation of NF-κB expression, the transcription factor controlling the activation of cellular pathways involved in inflammation.3

Recently, another candidate for an agent to prevent or delay neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the endocannabinoid system (ECS). The ECS consists of specific cannabinoid receptors expressed on immune cells including macrophages and dendritic cells.4 These cells release chemicals like the endocannabinoids into the extracellular environment that regulate many physiological processes including brain function, mood and pain.5–8 We have previously shown that the endogenous cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2R) and the CB1R are upregulated in early stages of AD when compared to normal age matched controls and that they are also upregulated in the CNS after experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis/chronic demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (EAE/CDP/PAMD) infection.9 These findings indicate that chronic inflammatory conditions involving EAE/CDP/PAMD can lead to the recruitment of cannabinoid receptors in the central nervous system that could be activated by environmental factors, e.g., stress.10,11 Similarly, we recently found that systemic application of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) significantly reduced the spontaneous production of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in both human and mouse monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1)-deficient peripheral blood mononuclear cells following exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS).12 Our previous work also showed that systemic administration of LPS reduces the number and intensity of microglial-mediated inflammatory responses in the spinal cord of EAE/CDP/PAMD patients.13 Therefore, our current study aimed to investigate whether treatment with a synthetic cannabinoid agonist, AM251,",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-11.499815940856934,125,no_prompt,4,0.9398496240601504,319,1

INTRODUCTION Multiple sclerosis (MS), also known as demyelinating polyneuropathy, is an inflammatory disease affecting the nervous system. It occurs in more than 1 million Americans every year and is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. MS affects nearly 10 percent of adults aged 60 years or older and almost 7 percent of children younger than 2 years old [1]. More than half of these individuals have been diagnosed by age 65 [2]. Although there are no cures for this devastating neurodegenerative disorder, patients can significantly reduce their symptoms through proper medical treatment [3-5] and lifestyle changes such as exercise, diet, and weight loss [6,7]. The prevalence of MS varies widely from country to country and across socioeconomic status. The majority of patients live in high income countries while about 40 percent reside in low income countries [8]. Most studies suggest that the prevalence of MS is lower in women compared to men but is similar in both sexes. In fact, women tend to be twice as likely to develop MS after age 50 than are men [9]. Currently, MS is estimated to affect approximately 4.4 million persons in the U.S. alone [10], with about 5 million new cases annually in the United States and some estimates suggesting that at least 20 percent of American residents may have MS [11]. While most MS patients exhibit considerable improvement upon initial diagnosis, most experience substantial relapse within five years [12]. Furthermore, MS has been shown to correlate with several factors including depression and health behaviors, which often lead to increased risk of mortality [13-17]. There is now compelling evidence to support the concept that MS may result from various underlying conditions that impair brain function and lead to the development of MS [18]. This hypothesis was first proposed in 1988 based on clinical observations showing that those with MS exhibited fewer cognitive functions as well as poorer memory and attention than controls [19]. However, other researchers have suggested that several of these behavioral abnormalities could be related to fatigue rather than impairment in cognition [20-22]. Therefore, it remains unclear whether these findings reflect true biological differences between the two populations or if they represent other underlying factors associated with MS [23]. Several studies have investigated the relationship between sleep and MS, and although some studies have found conflicting results, a few findings do seem",93,Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?,-0.0210469868034124,2,no_prompt,4,0.010101010101010102,426,37

Can I donate my body to science?

It is illegal in many states to use a donor's body for research without informed consent from the person who donated it. Most states require an advance written consent or an oral consent form that includes information about potential risks to the donor (such as infection). There are some exceptions: Some state laws allow people to donate organs after death if they have given full written consent to do so; some may also allow partial or no written consent; some permit transplantation even when a living person cannot be found; some states allow organ donations in cases where a deceased relative could not give permission because he or she lacked health insurance coverage or was too ill at time of death to understand what was being asked of them; some provide exemptions for specific types of donation (e.g., for those whose kidneys or hearts were removed for research); some permit organ donations even when the dead person is unable to sign a document allowing his or her organs for research; and some allow donors to waive all legal rights to privacy regarding medical records concerning their donor status.


What happens to a donor's organs after they die?

The National Organ Transplant Act requires that all human cadavers be cremated or buried before they are donated to science or used for scientific experimentation. The remaining tissues are typically sent through either bone marrow transplants or autologous blood products to patients with diseases such as leukemia, lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or multiple myeloma. Occasionally, stem cell therapy is performed on selected cadavers to treat cancer or other conditions. All organs must meet certain criteria established by federal law. In some instances, the recipient needs only one kidney, heart, lung, or liver but in others three or more organs are needed. A patient usually receives up to four livers per year depending on age, condition, and severity of illness. In the case of advanced kidney failure, kidney recipients receive two kidneys per day.

When are people legally responsible for me?

In most states, a person has the right to choose how to dispose of tissue that they gave voluntarily. However, this does not mean that they need never pay taxes on their gifts, nor does it make it okay to sell or give away material taken from them without their knowledge or consent.

""We now know that prostate cancer can progress and may even be fatal. If we are concerned about a man dying from a recurrence, our first line treatment should be aggressive surgery. But if a person has a high probability of developing advanced disease over time, the next step would be radiation therapy,"" said Dr. Jonathan Cachat, chief medical officer at Prostate Cancer Action, Inc., which promotes early detection and treatments for men with localized prostate cancers.

Dr. John R. Kremers, director of clinical research in urology at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, agreed: ""If you have a higher risk of death from another cause than having cancer in your prostate, I'd probably recommend waiting until after treatment.

The present study suggests that a combination of these two variables was an independent predictor of mortality among those with at least 25 years' follow up. Smoking is not only one of many factors involved in the etiology of several cancers, but it has been linked with the development of pancreatic neoplasia (Lobstein and Stenzel 1999). This condition can be caused by nicotine exposure during early childhood, which may lead to the abnormal growth of intestinal cells and the pancreas.

In this cohort, cigarette smokers had a significantly increased relative risk for developing pancreatic cancer compared with non-smokers (odds ratio 2·05; 95% CI 1·60–2·91), while a history of pancreatitis was a strong risk factor (1·55; 1·18–2·19) (Table I). A similar trend for a dose response relation between age at onset of cigarette smoking and incidence of pancreatic cancer could have occurred if it were considered separately for each category of history of pancreatitis. Furthermore, the association between pancreatic cancer and history of pancreatitis appeared weaker when analysis was restricted to never smokers who developed pancreatic cancer. Overall, we observed no significant interactions (p>0·01) between duration of current cigarette smoking and any of the other variables shown in Table I (the interaction term for cumulative number of cigarettes smoked per day remained statistically significant). However, duration of current smoking did interact with cigarette pack size (adjusted odds ratios 4·14 (3·02–6·10), 3·64 (2·93–5·46), and 2·98 (1·65–4·47) for men aged 30–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, and ≥80 packs/day, respectively), cigarette type (men's cigarettes versus women's cigarettes; adjusted OR 0·89 (0·58–1·32)), and duration of previous pancreatectomy (OR 1·00 (95% CI 0·94–1·09)) (Table II). No significant interactions were detected in the subgroup analyses for cigarette brand type, and there was evidence of heterogeneity across models.

The protocol was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and the study complied with UK National Health Service guidance on ethical conduct at research sites. All clinical investigations were carried out under full scientific and institutional review board approval.

Study design

The trial was a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of an investigational product comprising LNG-F-2M as part of a combination treatment compared with a placebo in lung cancer patients with stage 3/4 metastasis or high risk of relapse who are not eligible for surgical resection (stage 5–9) (see Supplementary Table 2 available online). A total of 60 patients were enrolled, of whom 45 completed follow-up assessments. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups: Group 1 received a single dose of 30 mg/kg LNG-F-2M; Group 2 received a single dose of 15 mg/kg LNG-F-2M followed by 10 mg/kg folic acid once daily. Study drug was supplied by Sigma Diagnostics (Stratford-on-Avon, United Kingdom). Participants provided written informed consent before participation and the study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00008181. The trial was conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines for Human Research, UK.

Patients and interventions

Participants were recruited between April 2012 and July 2013 through the Cancer Research UK community medicine clinics, general practice services and secondary care organisations. Eligible participants were adults diagnosed with lung cancer presenting with stage 3/4 metastases and high risk of relapsing. The following eligibility criteria were used: age 18 years or over; good general health; stable lifestyle including regular physical activity; no history of smoking; adequate diet (≥5 g/day carbohydrate, ≥1.7 g/day protein), moderate alcohol intake (<6 g/week); a BMI of 22 kg/m2 or less than 25 kg/m2; blood pressure <140 mm Hg; serum creatinine concentration <10 µmol/L; normal renal function; no previous surgery; and no known adverse reaction to study drug.

Treating such a flare-up takes at least six weeks of repeated injections with prednisone, one dose every other day. The last injection should take place two weeks after the previous ones have failed to clear the rash.

In addition to the fact that all meat is not created equal, we also need to look at the environmental impact of each type of meat in order to better understand how we can best use them for our health and well-being. A review of 16 different studies found that red meats like beef have a significant environmental footprint due to their large amounts of water used per pound (approximately 1,500 gallons), nitrogen fertilizers used as fertilizer on pastureland and land used for grazing livestock, as well as carbon emissions from fossil fuels.

While the global demand for beef has doubled over the past 50 years, this increase doesn't mean that we should be eating more beef. Instead, it means that we are consuming less beef than we did 50 years ago. In reality, when it comes to meat consumption there is no such thing as ""too much."" We need to focus on how much meat people actually eat rather than how many pounds they put down on the plate.

As an example, consider what happens with dairy products and meat alternatives. According to the USDA's National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference:

As mentioned above, even small changes in how we consume food can have a huge impact on the environment.

That's why I have been a strong advocate for raising the drinking age to 21 in this country as well as around the world. Because when teens start drinking before they are ready it can lead them down a dangerous path that ultimately puts their health at risk.

While it is true that most teenage drinkers do not get drunk on an everyday basis, studies show that about 40 percent of them eventually drink alcohol heavily enough to cause problems with driving or other activities that put themselves and others at risk.

This is a sobering reality because young people who begin drinking during adolescence tend to be more likely than older teenagers to binge drink (i.e., consume five or more drinks within two hours) or use drugs while intoxicated — and to become dependent on these substances. In fact, in recent years many states have passed laws restricting access to alcohol by those under 21 years old.

These are critical issues to address because if we don't protect our youth from getting behind the wheel impaired then we may end up causing more harm to our own communities through accidents and injuries caused by teen drivers.

Alcohol-impaired driving kills over 3,600 Americans each year, more than motor vehicle crashes and gun homicides combined. And although only 2.1 percent of all traffic deaths involve alcohol-related accidents in California, these accidents account for nearly half of all fatalities among underage drivers, including more than 400 lives lost annually. It also has tragic impacts in our families: One study found that one out of every eight children in the U.S. will suffer some form of maltreatment as a result of substance abuse.

Our efforts must go beyond increasing penalties for minors who drive under the influence of alcohol, because these measures alone are unlikely to prevent the harms caused by excessive drinking. That's because there are too many factors at work at any given time that contribute to risky behavior. For example, teenagers with lower incomes, limited education and less stability in their lives often face increased challenges in finding employment or financial resources to pay for alcohol, making it even harder for them to resist the temptation.",112,symptoms of asthma,-12.126522064208984,178,no_prompt,5,0.8476190476190476,371,7

We don't even know if most people who have MS actually suffer from it; we just assume so.

That's because the tests used today are outdated, inaccurate, and useless. These days, only 20-30% of people with MS will ever see their doctor. The rest never seek care for fear of being labeled ""complicated"" and sent home to die.

gpt2-xl_77,"I don't have MS, but when my period stopped suddenly and violently it caused me so much pain that the doctor recommended a pregnancy test. What does this mean about how many women with MS have unexplained infertility?

The most common causes of unexplained infertility are autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which can lead to low levels of sex hormones in the body and/or problems with ovulation (ovulation-associated infertility). These conditions may also affect the menstrual cycle, leading to unexpected periods and irregular cycles. The condition known as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is associated with an increased risk for unexplained pregnancy loss in women who aren't currently using birth control.

Polycystic ovary syndrome is characterized by an overproduction of the female hormone follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) at puberty. This leads to excess testosterone in the blood that can cause acne, abnormal hair growth, weight gain, mood swings and other hormonal changes. In addition to PCOS, some experts believe there's also another type of infertility called metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome involves high blood pressure, diabetes, elevated cholesterol levels and obesity. It's one of the largest health risks faced by American women today. Women with metabolic syndrome often have trouble getting pregnant.

Women with fertility issues should talk to their doctors before trying to conceive again after having had a baby without using contraception. If they're already expecting a child, however, fertility medications like medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo Provera), combined oral contraceptives (COCs) or intrauterine devices (IUDs) may be effective methods of preventing future pregnancies. Although these drugs prevent implantation, the chance of miscarriage is still quite small – less than 1 percent per year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

You may want to consider what will happen in the long run. If this is a new disclosure to someone close to you then maybe you should wait until things settle down before coming out to others. This would mean going into therapy, which is expensive; however, if you make no attempt to hide it from your friends and family, you might find some support as well. There could also be consequences if people don't believe you. For example, if people think you're lying about being diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis or that you're making it up, they'll say something like ""It's probably nothing,"" but they won't believe you. They may even accuse you of having a personality disorder. That's why I recommend being honest about what happened.

If you decide to go public with your information then there are certain consequences that come along with that decision. Depending upon where you live (and whether or not you live alone) there could be repercussions if your parents catch wind of this. Some states require employers to notify the Social Security Administration (SSA) if a worker is found to have been misclassified because of disability. The employer would likely lose their job and/or have all of your wages garnished. In addition, there are also fines, penalties and/or jail time depending on the state. But again, it depends upon the situation. It may be easier for you to simply get back in touch with your doctor and keep quiet about your diagnosis and treatment than try to fight such consequences.

The study used a large dataset containing information from more than 80 million individuals born between 1972 and 2011 in 23 countries across the world, including China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Pakistan, South Africa, and the United States. The data set consisted of information about height and weight at birth (measured using standardized scales), smoking status, education, household income, marital status, body mass index (BMI) and leisure-time physical activity, all collected through questionnaires administered by household members every two years.

Researchers analyzed the data using multilevel modeling techniques that allowed them to examine the association of multiple factors with different measures of physical activity. Their analysis found that physical activity increased substantially with age: Physical activity levels for adults aged 50 to 59 ranged from 46% above average to 84% above average compared with those aged 20 to 29, while levels rose to 88% above average or higher for adults aged 60 to 69. However, physical activity level was not associated with any particular lifestyle risk factor at older ages, regardless of gender or educational attainment.

""Most studies have shown that older adults tend to engage less in activities that are physically strenuous,"" said Rui Wang, one of the researchers and an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""Although this finding is consistent with previous research on healthy aging—older people are generally less active—this is the first large study to quantify this effect for older adults.""

Wang added, ""Our findings suggest that physically sedentary adults who start engaging in regular physical activity later in life may be able to reduce the risks associated with early onset of chronic diseases."" In addition, researchers noted that people who started to exercise before the age of 30 had better overall fitness levels than did persons who started exercising after they turned 65.

For example, participants who started exercising earlier were heavier and had poorer cardiovascular function but also lower mortality rates, as measured by total death, heart failure and stroke. Participants who exercised during middle age had better general health and survival; however, these gains appeared to plateau among participants who continued working until later in life. These results point to ""potential age effects on optimal patterns of physical activity among older adults,"" according to the paper, which appears online April 3 in JAMA Internal Medicine.

What is the best way to perform a yoga class?

When choosing an appropriate yoga class, you should consider all factors that can affect your level of fitness: age, gender, body type and fitness level. You may want to select a class that has more people in it or one with a different tempo so that everyone benefits from the same level of physical activity. This means you don't need to do everything at once as you could with the other types of classes. For example, if you are new to yoga, start by trying out some basic poses such as backbends, forward bends and twists (you should be able to complete these without pain) before moving on to more advanced variations. If you're looking for a high intensity class where you have to move fast but not too much then try out a class like Pigeon Pose, or even Vinyasa Flow, which involves lots of dynamic movement.

Do I need a particular teacher to teach me yoga?

Yoga teachers are essential to the success of any yoga class. They can offer encouragement to students and guide them through their first time in a class or provide guidance in dealing with difficult situations. However, they are not required to be qualified instructors and there is no minimum requirement to become a certified instructor. Most experienced teachers will take extra courses prior to becoming a certified instructor. There are many certified instructors available online for anyone who wants to learn how to be a yoga instructor. In addition, there are some accredited schools that train and certify yoga instructors; some of these schools are listed below.

There are many ways to find a yoga instructor in your area. Check with local yoga studios to see if they offer classes specifically for beginners or those who just starting out in yoga. Online search engines such as Yoga Guru and Yoga Search can also assist you with finding a teacher.

What equipment does an instructor require to run a successful class?

While most yoga teachers prefer to use low-impact cardio methods, there are times when it's necessary to wear some form of resistance training gear such as weights or a weighted vest during practice. An important rule of thumb is that if you have used weightlifting in the past you are unlikely to experience injury while doing yoga.

If your doctor prescribes topical corticosteroids, he or she should also recommend something to help keep your skin healthy, which could include vitamin A supplements. It's not uncommon for people with eczema to suffer from an excessive intake of vitamin A. I know several patients who went through dermatologists before they found out they were vitamin-A deficient. This was especially common among those suffering from severe psoriasis.

And finally, some experts say that taking a probiotic along with the topical steroid can reduce your risk of developing psoriasis. But again, this seems to be less effective than simply using the steroid itself, because it doesn't get into deeper layers of your skin. (This is probably why it doesn't really seem to slow down the development of psoriasis.) The same goes for overuse of oral antibiotics, which tend to promote bacterial resistance to the topical steroids. You'll have to experiment on your own to see if these things are worth trying.

All told, topical steroids don't appear to be a particularly good solution. However, as long as you stick to what's been recommended by your dermatologist, then this can be just about anything. And if you do experience a reaction after starting treatment, you shouldn't feel embarrassed to talk to your doctor about it. He or she may refer you to another specialist for further investigation.

However, the disease is not caused by your genes or lifestyle choices; it is caused by your immune system attacking its own cells in an attempt to destroy the diseased ones (see ""Why I'm so interested in MS research""). The exact cause of MS remains unknown but there are many theories on how this may occur. A small number of people with MS develop another autoimmune disorder called Multiple Sclerosis Reactive T Cells (MSRT). These MSRT cells attack healthy nerve cells in the spinal cord that control movement. As the damaged nerves are no longer able to transmit messages to muscles, they atrophy and eventually die. This process has been known for at least 30 years, although more recent studies show a similar loss of normal nerve cells as early as 7 weeks after birth, which indicates that MS develops earlier than previously thought. Some scientists believe that the first case of MS that occurs during pregnancy occurs before birth because the fetus' immune system is still developing and cannot tolerate the presence of certain substances in mother's milk. In these cases, babies may be born prematurely and die before they are able to learn to walk, speak or swallow independently.

How do people with schizophrenia respond to treatment?

Treatment response depends on several factors including age, severity of illness and quality of life before and during treatment. However, there have been positive results in terms of reducing symptoms, improving functional capacity and achieving better quality of life over time. For some patients, the initial course of treatment is very challenging but often improves after successful initiation of medication and continued support. In general, schizophrenia affects people differently; therefore, it is important to take into account the individual circumstances of each patient when discussing any potential drug regimen. For example, if you have recently had a relapse, the best way to proceed would probably be to wait until your symptoms improve and then resume treatment. If you continue with therapy and medications, you will likely be able to achieve remission more quickly than if you followed a standard course of treatment alone. Additionally, if you have a family history of psychosis, you could be eligible for a different type of treatment that focuses on treating symptoms rather than preventing recurrences. As with all illnesses, people who recover from schizophrenia should not stop taking their medication without consulting their doctor first. It is possible that the longer you continue to take your medication, the less effective it becomes. Some people with schizophrenia experience serious side effects while they are taking their drugs, so it is advisable to discuss this with your physician about how long you should stay on your medication.

METHODS:

We conducted a cross-sectional, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial comparing T3 or placebo treatment in 6 PH patients diagnosed with primary hyperthyroidism and treated with T4 and/or TSH replacement therapy for 3 months. Primary outcome measures included the Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) score at baseline (T4), 10 weeks (placebo) and 18 weeks (T3). Secondary outcomes included the Clinical Global Impressions - Severity (CGI-S) score at baseline (T4), 16 weeks (placebo), 20 weeks (T3), 24 weeks (T2 and T3, respectively) and 30 weeks (T1).

RESULTS:

Fourteen patients were enrolled; 2 patients dropped out of the protocol before enrollment. At week 10, both T3 and placebo groups improved significantly from baseline by CGI-I, while only T3 group showed significant improvement compared to baseline. Both T3 and placebo groups showed significant improvements in the CGI-S score between baseline and week 15, whereas only T3 group showed significant improvement in this measure between baseline and week 12. We observed no clinically important differences between T3 and placebo in either patient's mood state.

1. The chronic inflammation of the peripheral blood vessels of a chronically infected brain may cause the onset of autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases.2,3

2. Infection with Toxoplasma gondii may also contribute to MS by promoting the development of autoantibodies against myelin (myelin basic protein).4

3. An infection with Clostridium difficile may result in the production of supernatants that could be toxic to the central nervous system.5

The presence of infectious agents on brain tissue is highly suggestive of a viral etiology for MS, but their exact role in exacerbating symptoms and causing disease progression has not been determined. Some studies have suggested that infections with cytomegalovirus (CMV) are associated with greater prevalence of clinical manifestations of MS.6-8 Other researchers have shown evidence of an association between CMV infection and MS disease activity.9

Clinical features

MS is thought to be the most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting the central nervous system. It usually occurs later than other neurological disorders and affects people of all ages in developed countries. It is characterized by progressive nerve cell loss and cognitive impairment. Symptoms can vary from mild to severe depending on the degree of neuronal loss, particularly at the periphery, as well as the severity of disability.10 MS is commonly associated with psychiatric comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse, which may interfere with treatment outcome.11

Neurological signs and symptoms

The diagnostic criteria for MS include at least two primary neurologic deficits, including:

A deficit in language function (auditory or visual); and/or A deficit in memory or concentration; and/or A cognitive (specific) learning or memory impairment.12

Visual impairments (ataxia, dysarthria, strabismus), motor deficits, abnormal reflexes, poor coordination, and tardive dyskinesia occur more frequently in patients with MS compared to age-matched controls.13 Patients with MS often show neuropsychological findings similar to those found in individuals who do not suffer from MS, including impaired attention, executive functioning, judgment, memory, speed of processing, language comprehension, planning, problem solving, and working memory.14

In addition to these main symptoms, patients experiencing MS also present with non-painful sensory changes, such as vision problems, numbness or weakness, pain, tingling, burning sensation,",92,causes of fatigue in MS,-5.252610683441162,31,no_prompt,5,0.13839285714285715,351,30

I had been told that this was possible but it wasn't until I started the Paleo Diet that I discovered how much of an impact you can make on your health by removing all sugar, dairy and grains from your diet.

At the time of writing I have lost around 50 pounds in 8 weeks and am now in a good place to start eating healthier again!

If this sounds like something that could help you too – then why not give it a go? If you're already on the path towards weight loss – then take things one step at a time so you don't get discouraged or feel like you've wasted your time.

The next step is to build up your ketone levels through increasing your fat intake. As well as reducing your carb intake you should be adding extra fats to your meals to ensure you are getting enough fuel for energy production during exercise.

These steps will ensure you burn more fat than carbs when exercising. If you find yourself burning carbs instead of burning fat whilst exercising – then this may indicate that you're using the wrong fuels during exercise.

When you burn carbs, they turn into glucose which allows the body to use its stored glycogen stores to power muscle contraction. This also increases insulin sensitivity allowing your muscles to work harder. When you burn fat, they turn into ketones which also provide more energy for physical activity.

This increased metabolism is particularly important if you are training hard.

Protein

One thing I'm often asked about is protein. The problem with high carbohydrate diets such as Atkins or Paleo is that many people do not consume adequate amounts of protein to meet their requirements.

Some people even cut out whole food sources altogether leaving them severely deficient in essential nutrients. Protein is just one part of a balanced nutrition plan that will allow you to support healthy tissue growth and repair without putting unwanted strain on your joints.

A recent study showed that consuming 35g of protein per day significantly reduced the progression of knee osteoarthritis compared to those who consumed less than 10 g/day. Additionally a review published in 2012 found that protein consumption has shown promise as a treatment strategy for Osteoporosis.

Fat

Fat plays a vital role in your body's immune system, regulating blood pressure, lowering cholesterol and maintaining bone density. There are two main types of fat:

The study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, is part of a larger effort to better understand how various genetic mutations affect people with MS. That information could help scientists develop more effective treatments for a disease that affects about 1 million Americans and causes progressive paralysis.

""We have known for quite some time that different genes are involved,"" said Dr. Michael DeGroat, an associate professor of neurology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine who was not involved in the research. ""This study provides another step forward to get a clearer picture.""

People with MS lose neurons and synapses that relay signals between them. These connections are crucial to regulating movement, speech and other functions. As patients progress through their disease, they lose these connections in large numbers and may become paralyzed by the resulting weakness or numbness. The new findings suggest that many different genes play a role in this process, but it's unknown which ones contribute most strongly.

""We know there are many genes associated with MS,"" said Thomas Leffler, director of the Human Genome Sequencing Center at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and senior author on the paper. ""These results indicate we need to consider all the possible gene variants, and even then, it can be hard to tease apart what each one contributes.""

To find out, researchers analyzed samples from nearly 2,000 adults with MS and about 3,500 healthy controls. They looked at both short stretches of DNA called single nucleotide polymorphisms — SNPs — and longer stretches of DNA called microsatellites. This type of sequencing allows researchers to look for changes in more than one place along the entire length of DNA.

Previous studies had found that a handful of small SNPs were associated with MS. For example, about 30 percent of those affected by MS have two copies of a particular SNP known as rs1223983, while 5 percent of healthy individuals carry only one copy. Other studies have found smaller associations between MS-linked SNPs and health outcomes such as weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. But none examined how much genetic variation has contributed to susceptibility to the disease, which is known to start in midlife.

For the current study, the researchers compared the genomes of participants with MS and healthy controls using state-of-the-art technology called genome-wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS identify common genetic variations that account for the vast majority of differences among groups of people with MS.

Using these data sets and statistical analysis,",57,multiple sclerosis stages phases,-11.199237823486328,74,no_prompt,5,0.357487922705314,414,0

""We believe this is a big step forward in understanding the disease and its pathogenesis,"" said lead investigator Dr. William C. Langer, director of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) in Bethesda, Md., who was not involved with the study. ""This may lead to new therapeutic targets or better ways to detect and treat MS.""

The findings, which appear online April 15 in Science Translational Medicine, were based on genetic analysis of blood samples from 32 people with a history of multiple sclerosis and 36 healthy controls. The researchers also compared mutations within genes known to be associated with MS with those of more than 500 other diseases. They found that about 90 percent of people with MS have one or more rare genetic variants linked to abnormal proteins produced by neurons. These include two gene variants — called TP53R and MS1S8 — that are linked to increased levels of an enzyme, NSE2, that is implicated in inflammation and damage caused by MS. This finding suggests that these changes can start as early as 20 years before symptoms begin in most people, according to the study authors.",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-10.761798858642578,109,no_prompt,5,0.8195488721804511,188,2

gpt2-xl_72,"Covid-19 is a live virus vaccine that protects against seven different viruses. Its safety profile has been established in over 1 million patients who have received this vaccine in clinical trials.

Covid-19 has been shown to be well tolerated by most patients who receive it and may provide some protection from common infections such as pneumonia, influenza or tuberculosis (TB). There are no data on the effectiveness of the vaccination against certain diseases. There's also not enough information to know whether there is any risk for adverse events associated with the vaccination. However, if you're being treated for MS, you should consult your doctor before you start receiving any vaccinations.

Who can get the vaccine?

The vaccine has been approved for use in adults aged 18 years and older. It works best if given between 4 weeks and 6 months after starting treatment with antiviral medicines, including atovaquone. Your doctor will probably ask you about:

How long you've had MS and how often you take antiviral medications.

Whether you have other health conditions that might make it hard to tolerate the vaccine or its administration.

If you have an allergy to any part of the body. You must tell your doctor right away if you feel ill during or after giving the vaccine. If you do have a reaction to the vaccine, contact your local healthcare provider immediately.

You need a prescription from your doctor and may be charged up to £100 for one.

What happens after I give the vaccine?

After you complete the first dose of the vaccine, you'll usually be told to go home and recover until you have another checkup a few days later. In rare cases, the vaccine may be delayed while your immune system builds up to fight off further infection. This could last several weeks. Talk to your doctor if you develop symptoms like fever, sore throat, swollen glands or muscle aches within 2 weeks after receiving the second dose of the vaccine. The vaccine only works when it reaches the parts of the brain and spinal cord where antibodies are made.

The vaccine doesn't contain any live viruses. Once it's finished protecting you against a particular disease, it stops working, so you won't be protected again. After the third or fourth shot, the vaccine should stop working completely. Any leftover vaccine would harm your body.

Can I still pass on my infection?

No, the vaccine doesn't prevent transmission of infections. It might also work less well. For example, the vaccine",72,Is the Covid-19 vaccine safe for people taking multiple sclerosis drugs?,-0.0133755514398217,19,no_prompt,5,0.0892018779342723,418,43

These differences could be due to the different study designs or because of chance, but are important given the magnitude of this relation.

Our results indicate an increased risk of colorectal adenoma for those who have a vitamin D level below 20 ng/mL at baseline. The strongest evidence for this comes from the multivariate logistic regression analysis. We observed a nonlinear dose–response relationship for vitamin D intake levels up to 25 ng/mL (P < 0.01) as well as above 50 ng/mL (P = 0.04).

We were unable to obtain data on vitamin D status prior to diagnosis so we cannot rule out residual confounding by age, gender, race/ethnicity, smoking, physical activity, dietary habits, or any other covariates related to the disease. Future studies should consider such potential confounders. Although our findings do not imply that low vitamin D status is causally associated with colon cancer, these results suggest that individuals with lower vitamin D concentrations may have higher risks of this disease than people with high vitamin D levels.

The finding that men and women had similar patterns of vitamin D intakes throughout their lifetime suggests that there is little variation in vitamin D consumption across populations. Furthermore, the results of this study support previous findings indicating an inverse correlation between serum 25(OH)D concentration and colorectal adenomas among elderly people in the United States.22 Moreover, in our population of older adults, a history of colorectal cancer was strongly associated with vitamin D deficiency.24 Our results also support previous findings linking the prevalence of colorectal adenomas with the use of sunscreen.25 However, one limitation of this study is the lack of information on sun exposure over a defined period prior to the first incident tumor. In addition, although participants provided information about sun exposure during their entire follow-up time frame, we did not collect information about skin color as we only examined white participants. Finally, the limited number of cases prevented us from conducting subgroup analyses based on specific factors including body mass index, diabetes mellitus, or alcohol consumption. Future studies should continue to examine whether some common lifestyle factors—such as smoking, obesity, and physical activity—are independent risk factors for colorectal adenoma.

METHODS:

We searched PubMed (January 1966 through August 2010) using ""folic acid,"" ""associates with autism,"" ""ADHD,"" ""autism spectrum disorders,"" ""attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,"" ""attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,"" ""prenatal vitamins,"" and their synonyms for English language articles. We included only articles that reported either a prospective cohort study of children with ASD who were exposed to folic acid supplements during pregnancy or randomized controlled trials that compared folic acid exposure before and after birth to placebo in comparison to control groups.

RESULTS:

Eleven studies met our inclusion criteria; nine involved women whose children developed ASD; eight involved mothers whose offspring developed autism; three involved a placebo group; and one did not report on any of these outcomes. All 10 studies found increased risk for ASD associated with maternal folic acid supplementation after adjustment for confounding factors. The highest risk was observed among those with both low and high levels of folate intake (relative risk 2.13). No significant effect modification by family history was evident.

There are limitations of this study that need to be considered, including the small sample size; a very low proportion of patients were randomized (3%) and there is some evidence from other studies that randomization may have resulted in selection bias; and no information on long-term outcomes or survival was available. These limitations do not alter the findings of this review.

The clinical significance of a difference in risk across treatments for lung cancer remains unclear. Although some trials suggest higher rates of progression with radiotherapy versus chemotherapy in advanced disease [42], others report no statistically significant differences at all [43]. However, the clinical relevance of such results is difficult to quantify because of the variation in the definition of ""advanced"" (e.g., does a patient go through what would be considered stage 3/4 rather than stage 2 or stage 3?). Furthermore, the data reviewed here are based on only one type of comparison — incidence rates. The potential effect of therapy in terms of overall survival cannot yet be quantified without more detailed treatment comparisons. For example, it has been suggested that early aggressive surgical treatment for primary carcinoma might increase survival among older patients with locally advanced disease [44] and that treatment with high doses of radiation can accelerate disease progression in certain types of solid tumors [45,46]. We also found little support for these hypotheses. For example, the largest observational study of prostate cancer mortality reported a 5% lower rate of death in men undergoing radical surgery compared to those receiving standard care [47]; but even this large study could not demonstrate whether radical treatment reduces the risk of death, only that it lowers the chance of dying from any cause. This discrepancy suggests that there may be clinically meaningful differences in survival based on prognosis rather than treatment choice.",117,stage 4 metastatic lung cancer outcome,-10.53197193145752,88,no_prompt,5,0.3548387096774194,312,6

That said, a lot has been written about how much we need to eat to be healthy. But how much you should eat is actually very individualized. So what are some guidelines that will help you figure out how much food you really need?


The amount of calories you consume is important because it affects your weight. To lose fat, you need fewer calories than you take in. However, while losing weight, you also want to eat as many nutrients as possible. Fat does contain more protein than other types of foods (and less calories), but its total value may not make up for the extra calories it contains. Other nutrient-rich foods like fruit, vegetables, beans, eggs, nuts, seeds and whole grains can give you all the nutrients you'll ever need without adding excess calories. For example, if you have enough fiber in your diet, which helps keep you regular, you won't gain weight. If you don't eat enough carbohydrates, such as fruits, vegetables and legumes, your blood sugar levels will become high. The result: you'll feel hungry all the time. In order to stay full longer, you'll have to eat more, since your body needs energy to digest these carbohydrates.

However, when these problems occur together, they can become dangerous.

Diagnosis

There's no single test for CFS/ME, but there are several measures of fatigue and an individual's overall health status. A doctor will take the following:

Physical examination: physical exam including: blood pressure, weight, respiratory rate, skin color and general appearance

physical exam including: blood pressure, weight, respiratory rate, skin color and general appearance Vital signs: a fasting blood glucose level of 90 mg/dL to 100 mg/dL, resting pulse rate of 60 beats per minute to 75 beats per minute, and breathing rate of 15 breaths per minute

a fasting blood glucose level of 90 mg/dL to 100 mg/dL, resting pulse rate of 60 beats per minute to 75 beats per minute, and breathing rate of 15 breaths per minute Neurological exam: EEG (electroencephalography), ECG, CT scan

EKGs (electrocardiograms) help tell if you have a brain tumor or other abnormality, and may also detect some mental abnormalities. If one of your vital signs shows any abnormal changes, contact your family physician immediately. An electrocardiogram will show an increase in your heartbeat during periods of increased activity. You may have an arrhythmia (an irregular heartbeat) or ""tachycardia"" – fast paced heart beat. The tachycardia usually stops after a few minutes, but sometimes lasts longer than that. This can be confusing because these symptoms could actually represent mental health issues rather than physical ones.

A CT scan, called a computed tomographic scan or PET scan, reveals areas of high concentration of nerve tissue on an x-ray image. If this is not present, further testing may need to be done to identify any underlying disease process affecting your nervous system.

If you suspect something more serious is going on, your next step should be a neurologist. These specialists look at how your brain functions and what happens inside your skull – specifically whether you have lesions, damage or dysfunction of nerves and blood vessels.

Fertility Awareness Methods (FAMs): These methods may decrease the amount of oestrogen that your body produces or make more of, which may lead to abnormal hormone production. FAMs include the rhythm method and the basal thermometer method. These methods are most effective when used as directed by your healthcare provider.

Hormones from Other Sources

Most nonprescription hormones have been shown to increase circulating levels of progesterone. This includes estradiol, prolactin, testosterone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). For this reason, these types of drugs should only be used with caution if you have a family history of breast cancer.

For Women Who Are Using Estradiol

To prevent possible problems with fertility during treatment with estrogen therapy, the National Cancer Institute recommends stopping oral contraceptives within 3 months after starting hormone replacement therapy. Ask your doctor about the safest time to stop using oral contraception for hormonal reasons.

If you miss an oral contraceptive dose, take one back at the same time each day for 7 days. If it's easy to do so, skip the missed tablet. Continue taking 1 regular pack (10 tablets) every day until the next scheduled dose. Use the back-up method and call your healthcare provider right away if you miss 2 consecutive pills.

What Is the Best Time to Take Estrogens?

Estrogen therapy generally works best when taken at least 30 minutes before intercourse. It also has been found to be most effective when given either 30 minutes before or 45 minutes after the first sexual contact. You may need extra doses depending on how often you're having sex, your age, whether you're pregnant, and other factors. Your dose will be different with each individual woman.

Some doctors recommend starting estrogen with a minimum daily dose between 100 mcg and 400 mcg of ethinyl estradiol. Others start with lower dosages and gradually raise them over several weeks to reach their desired level of effectiveness. Follow your doctor's advice carefully, especially if you're already pregnant or trying to become pregnant.

Stress

The researchers looked at a group of more than 2,000 men from an international cohort that had participated in the Women's Health Initiative, which started in 1988 and tracked about 12,500 women as they followed their heart disease risk factors over time. Researchers also interviewed 671 participants about whether they were taking any medications for medical conditions. They found that people who reported high levels of stress — such as feeling stressed all the time or being emotionally unstable — were nearly twice as likely as those who felt less stressful to develop some type of infection.

In addition, people who said they suffered from symptoms of depression — including anxiety and low energy — were roughly two times as likely to experience bacterial infections. People who said they frequently experienced bouts of depression were even more prone, with bacteria being four times as common among people who suffer from depression than normal.

""When we're stressed out and anxious, our immune system goes into a state called inflammation,"" said study co-author Dr. Robert F. Cantrell, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. ""And when inflammation occurs, it can cause problems in the gut that can lead to various diseases like inflammatory bowel disease and cancer.""

Previous studies have suggested that stress might play a role in the development of these diseases, but this new research is one of the first to show direct links between mental illness and bacterial resistance to antibiotics.

Dr. Anthony W. Rizzo, director of gastrointestinal pathology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said that while it may seem surprising that emotional distress could promote antibiotic resistance, he has seen it many times before.

""It happens quite often with patients with psychiatric disorders and I think it has been known that psychological issues are associated with certain types of infection,"" Rizzo told LiveScience.

For example, when Rizzo worked at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn., he saw several cases where patients developed pneumonia after contracting tuberculosis from an infected patient whose immune systems were compromised by suicide attempts, drug abuse or other life stresses.

The main difference between an IV solution with ethanol versus a placebo is the concentration of ethanol (i.e., the amount of alcohol in the solution). The concentrations of ethanol used in these studies were about 75 percent ethanol by volume (3) or approximately 12 mg/mL. For comparison purposes, a human blood plasma contains approximately 4-6mg/L of ethanol. This means that if you are giving yourself a dose of 15 mg/kg body weight, your IV solution would contain only around 3 mg/kg ethanol. Therefore, when treating patients with severe symptoms of neuropathy, it is important to use an ethanol concentration that produces a similar effect as that seen in the real world. When administering an ethanol infusion, always make sure to dilute the solution so that the patient can actually taste it. Even though we see many cases where people have difficulty drinking an ethanol solution because they are unable to taste it, it should be noted that this issue does not exist for all ethanol solutions. In fact, the same amount of ethanol can be delivered without any problems at 100% concentration. So keep your ethanol concentration on the lower side as long as possible until you get to a level where the patient cannot tolerate the concentration.

Injections using ethanol solutions must be administered cautiously because anesthesia, especially during surgery, could result in loss of consciousness. Since one of the primary goals of anesthesia is to prevent unconsciousness, injecting into a vein which has been previously blocked by catheters might also impair the ability of the person receiving the injection to feel pain. Also, since there is no direct correlation between the size of the needle used in a procedure and how much of the drug will be absorbed by the body, it is better to avoid large needles whenever possible. This makes sense given the increased risks associated with large doses of drugs. However, if it is necessary to inject small amounts of a drug, a 6"" to 8"" needle can be used, assuming the area being treated is completely numb (see Figure 2). Another option for small amounts of medication is a syringe attached to a 1"" balloon. These pumps allow an increase in the dosage to be applied while maintaining the air flow over the skin. Since most people prefer using a pump and tube rather than injecting directly into a vein, I recommend trying both methods first, checking with your doctor first to see what works best for you.

A new deal with the Browns could help him reach that goal.

The Browns signed Davis to a four-year, $25 million contract extension on Monday. The team also announced that they had reached an agreement with quarterback Brandon Weeden and receiver Miles Austin on three-year deals.

Davis' new deal means the Browns will pay him nearly twice as much in guaranteed money ($28.5 million) than they paid Joe Thomas ($13 million).

It also gives Cleveland a player who will be 31 when the 2012 season begins what he calls ""the perfect storm of age and skill set.""

If things go well next season, Davis believes he could play out his entire career with the Browns -- and then retire after one more year if the franchise were to select him in the NFL draft.

""This was all planned from Day 1,"" he told ESPNChicago.com before taking questions during an appearance Monday night on ""First Take."" ""All my dreams are coming true now. It feels really good. All my life I always dreamed to play in this league.""

So, don't be discouraged if you still have some symptoms when you start your treatments. The sooner you begin treatment, the more likely you are to experience improvement. And if you do start a course of treatment within 6 months of getting your diagnosis, we recommend making sure you follow all the treatment directions and follow-up appointments as instructed by your doctor. You may want to consider seeing an MS specialist (such as a neurologist or rheumatologist) who specializes in treating people who suffer from chronic pain caused by MS. This is especially important because you might need other medications that target inflammation, such as anti-inflammatory drugs or steroids, which could help ease many of the worst symptoms. It's also very important to consult with your doctor about any unusual changes in your health since you were diagnosed with MS. In general, there is no reason not to see a doctor about these things:

How do I know whether my doctor has prescribed a medication to treat MS?

MS medications include those used to treat pain and reduce inflammation, but they can also help manage muscle spasms and headaches. Some drugs are taken to fight the nerve damage that occurs in MS. Medications can be effective for people with milder forms of MS; they can prevent further deterioration of motor skills and decrease the risk of relapsing. However, some people continue to have significant problems even after taking the medicine. If you are concerned about side effects, talk to your doctor before beginning treatment.

What medications should I take as part of MS treatment?

You'll get most benefit from taking one drug at a time so you can adjust your dose to get the best results. Your doctor can give you a list of the different types of medications available and tell you how to choose the right drug for you. There are several ways to administer medications, including using inhalers, swallowing pills or taking oral tablets. Ask your physician what type of oral medication would work best for you.

How can I get a good estimate of the probability that my child will have peanut allergy? What's the best way to know the likelihood of an allergic reaction in my child?

There are only two ways to find out how likely it is that your child has peanut allergy:

Look for symptoms such as hives, wheezing or swelling around their mouth and face. Ask your health care provider if you're at risk for developing a food allergy and ask them to look for signs of peanut exposure. If they find something like this on anaphylactic tests, you'll be able to compare your results with others who tested negative for allergy. It's also possible to detect peanut allergies in early life by having your child get peanut-free diets and/or immunizations.

If neither approach works (for example, if your child doesn't have any positive skin testing), there's no easy way to tell whether your child really does have a peanut allergy. The best bet might be to wait until your child turns 18 or 19 before getting more aggressive about avoiding peanuts.",102,randomly gotten eczema,-13.408467292785645,97,no_prompt,6,0.9897959183673469,182,0

Preventing the spread of infection is a key to preventing serious complications. A pregnant woman who is not receiving prenatal care has a higher risk of developing an infection, such as toxoplasmosis or herpes simplex virus (HSV). Pregnant women with HSV may also have a greater risk of acquiring HIV, which can be passed on through sexual contact. For this reason, it is very important that all pregnant women get tested for both HSV-1 and -2. Women should avoid having sex with people who do not know they are infected. Additionally, if you suspect you might be infected with either virus, ask your health care provider about testing for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and tell him/her anything that could make you more likely to pass these pathogens along to your baby during childbirth. The more STIs a woman knows about at the time she becomes pregnant, the better prepared she will be when delivery day arrives.

The following are some precautions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):

• Use latex condoms every time you have vaginal intercourse;

• Use the highest quality latex condom available, with extra protection from water-based lubricants; and

• Don't share towels, razors, toothbrushes, sponges, washcloths, etc. if possible.

Pregnancy symptoms typically last three to four weeks after the last period, but the first week postpartum can be quite painful because the uterus does not produce enough amniotic fluid, which helps nourish the growing fetus. If you feel like you are not gaining weight or gaining too much weight, there's a good chance you are pregnant.

Cerebellum (brain's ""little engine"")

Neurons in the cerebellum

Brain stem (stem cells)

The cerebellum controls balance and movement. When these areas are affected by MS, there is increased difficulty with fine motor skills such as grasping objects or reading or writing. These problems may make it difficult for you to do everyday activities that require fine motor control such as driving a car. For example, it may be difficult to perform basic tasks like holding a fork above the plate while eating food.

If your symptoms are severe enough, people often need to give up their jobs and leave school, even if they want to keep working. The consequences include decreased earning capacity, limited mobility and reduced quality of life. Some people find it difficult to live independently without help from family members.

How common is this condition?

According to the latest data available from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 1 million Americans had MS at some time during 2011. Nearly half of them were between ages 20 and 64 years old. In addition, more than 11 million people worldwide suffer from MS. It is estimated that up to one-third of people with MS will develop other neurological disorders and/or die early due to complications such as stroke or heart attack. MS can also cause memory loss and dementia, which causes a person to lose his or her identity and sense of self.

MS has become increasingly prevalent over the past few decades, particularly among women and adolescents. Currently, about 7% of adults in the U.S. are diagnosed with MS.

What happens after I get MS?

After you develop MS, your body will begin to slowly deteriorate, causing an overall decline in health, productivity and social function. There are several different types of MS:

Primary progressive MS (PPMS): Causes the first symptoms of MS, usually within 2 years of onset. PPs usually come on gradually. They may have pain, numbness or tingling around the area of the brain, along with muscle weakness, fatigue and cognitive difficulties, as well as speech impediments. Although these initial symptoms appear very similar to those seen in a number of other diseases, some researchers believe that they represent a unique form of MS.",63,Will multiple sclerosis affect my career?,-0.0821538195014,6,no_prompt,6,0.024,411,3

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in reward, motivation, learning, memory, attention, motor function and the regulation of appetite. It also affects learning and mood, and it has been associated with stress, depression and anxiety disorders. Dopamine levels increase during activity, and decreased dopamine concentrations are known to cause fatigue, poor concentration, sleep disturbances, loss of appetite and increased cravings for alcohol or drugs.

Researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison have found that exposure to high-dose dopamine increases the risk of developing MS. The study was published online April 8, 2012 in PLOS ONE by Jodi Gilman and David K. Pasek of UW-Madison and colleagues.

""High doses of dopamine were highly effective at suppressing immune responses,"" said Gilman, assistant professor of neurobiology. ""We wanted to determine if this effect could be attributed to increased inflammation.""

In previous work, Gilman had shown that low dopamine levels result in reduced ability to suppress the immune response after infection -- so inhibiting the immune system may lead to more MS symptoms. She hypothesizes that high-dose dopamine induces inflammation as well.

To test this hypothesis, the researchers exposed mice to high-dose dopamine before an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) virus exposure, which targets the brain's white matter, and then again two weeks later after viral clearance. Mice injected with the same virus showed fewer signs of MS two weeks following treatment.

The findings suggest that high-dose dopamine enhances the release of inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1beta, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha, thereby inducing CNS inflammation and potentially exacerbating the disease process.

""This research suggests that dopamine plays an essential part in facilitating the development of MS.

gpt2-xl_54,"MSD: Multiple Sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. It has been described as a ""wound in the brain."" The central nervous system is comprised of four major parts, the spinal cord and its branches (the spinal column), the optic nerve, the nerves of sensation (e.g., skin) and the peripheral nerves. Each of these sections has distinct functions.

Multiple Sclerosis symptoms usually begin with the first symptoms of flu-like symptoms such as headache or muscle aches, followed by loss of vision (myopia). This usually happens before age 30. Later, the progressive deterioration can be so severe that people lose all sense of smell. People also become blind without treatment. Some patients may also experience changes to their body movements, which may lead to limb weakness and difficulty walking or reaching objects. Other symptoms can include blurred vision, tremors, ataxia, incoordination, confusion, seizures, muscle spasms, speech abnormalities, and hearing loss. In addition to pain, MS causes other problems including cognitive dysfunction, sleep disorders, depression, anxiety, memory lapses, mood swings, and gastrointestinal problems.

What causes multiple sclerosis?

The exact cause of multiple sclerosis remains unknown but several factors have been associated with the onset of this illness. These include genetic mutations, exposure to toxins and environmental pollutants, viral infections, infection during pregnancy and some diseases that affect the immune system.

For example, it is known that there are genes involved in the development of T cells (immune cells) and B cells (white blood cells that fight off infections). Scientists believe that many different types of viruses may trigger or contribute to multiple sclerosis. For instance, they show evidence that cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus (VZV), human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) play important roles. Environmental hazards such as chemicals may also influence the development of multiple sclerosis. For example, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, chromium and nickel all have been linked with multiple sclerosis.

Other research indicates that certain environmental chemicals can alter cell membranes and increase the risk of developing multiple sclerosis. Exposure to pollutants known as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has been shown to result in damage to the myelin sheath around neurons. When myelin sheaths break down over time, neuronal transmission between the two hemispheres of the brain can be",54,What does multiple sclerosis diagnosis include?

It is important to note that ""mood disorder"" in itself does not mean you have a mood disorder. It simply refers to symptoms caused by your condition, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, etc., which are symptoms of an underlying medical problem. These illnesses will be discussed further on throughout this page.

Mental health is defined as the capacity for human learning and behavior based on emotions. This includes thoughts, feelings, impulses, preferences, aspirations, social interactions, and ability to experience pleasure. The primary function of the mind is to interpret information received from the senses and make decisions about what to do with it. The brain is made up of many different parts called neurons and each neuron has one job: to receive sensory input (in the form of light, sound, touch) and send signals down the nerve pathways to other cells that are necessary for carrying out specific tasks. There are millions of these nerves which connect all over the body. In order to perform their jobs properly, the neuron must receive appropriate messages from its neighbors so that they know how to respond to the information. Many types of communication involve nerve signaling; however, in our case we only need to discuss three kinds of neural connections: communication between parts of the brain (called synapses), transmission of electrical signals from one part of the brain to another (called excitatory/inhibitory connections), and communication among individual parts of the brain. All of these forms of communication are controlled by neuronal activity inside the brain. Each type of communication requires a certain amount of energy in order to transmit the message, but once a signal reaches the correct destination, the brain can then use it to control the actions of other regions of the brain where the signal originated.

Because your thoughts, feelings, ideas, desires, beliefs and memories are stored within your brain, if these things are disturbed they affect how well you think, feel and act. As a result, there are several ways that disorders like addiction can cause a person's thinking, feeling and behavior to become distorted. One way is through the accumulation of negative experiences. Another way is through the manipulation of feelings that have no real basis in reality. A third way is through the creation of false memories of past events. Even though these things seem like they could happen to anyone at any time, they can often occur in people who are suffering from severe stress, abuse, or trauma. If these things don't get addressed, it is easy to end up",52,What are the most common mental health problems?

My philosophy revolves around the principles of natural healing, which can be found in many other fields of science such as physics, chemistry, biology, etc., but also in ancient and modern cultures and religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Judaism and Islam. The purpose of my work is to help people live harmoniously with their own bodies by providing an alternative approach to health care that involves applying appropriate therapeutic modalities based on the body's own inherent wisdom (vital force). This approach not only helps individuals achieve optimum health, it provides support for relationships, family life, self-esteem and spiritual wellbeing. It has been well established over thousands of years that healthy living requires the balance between the mind and body. I believe that this harmony is achieved through understanding the power of the body and its ability to heal itself. In fact, most diseases are caused by imbalances within the human system, and when these imbalances become extreme or persistent they cause illness. For example, if you have chronic pain, your digestive system needs the proper balance of nutrients and minerals. If you suffer from high blood pressure, then certain amino acids must be released from your liver. As long as there is a sufficient supply of these essential substances, it will do its job and keep the heart pumping, kidneys working and every organ functioning at maximum capacity. However, if they remain chronically low, stress can cause damage to all systems. When our organs become damaged we begin to experience symptoms. These symptoms can range from mild discomfort to severe and often permanent problems. One of the greatest causes of suffering is disease, which occurs when certain parts of the body malfunction. Some examples include: poor circulation; reduced absorption of vital minerals and vitamins; increased blood pressure; elevated cholesterol levels; abnormal blood sugar levels; impaired immune function; diabetes mellitus; kidney failure; chronic fatigue syndrome; arthritis; cardiovascular diseases; osteoarthritis; sleep disorders; depression; nervous system dysfunction; mental retardation; Parkinson's Disease; cancer; and even aging. Each one of us suffers from some combination of these problems. However, the more serious the problem, the greater the chances are that we will eventually succumb to it. And it doesn't matter how old you are! Most of us die prematurely because of the illnesses that plague us today.

The study, published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences, found that people with Borderline Personality Disorder had a greater tendency to believe they were better than others at their jobs.

Psychologists also looked at whether this difference between men and women was related to other personality characteristics like neuroticism or agreeableness.

They say it is important for employers to keep in mind when evaluating job applicants who have borderline personality disorders because they may be less likely to fit into conventional work roles compared to the general population.

""We need to take more care when hiring individuals with BPD to ensure their personalities are properly considered,"" said lead author Dr. Daniel Siegel from Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

While previous research has suggested that people with BPD struggle in certain situations such as in relationships, Siegel says those findings did not fully explain why some people with BPD didn't perform well on these tests.

As part of the new study researchers used data collected by the National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans (NSEHAP). The survey included a variety of workplace environments including an interview process where participants took questions about their personality traits and how they might contribute to positive outcomes for the organization.

In the interviews, participants rated each of four personality variables: extraversion; openness to experience; conscientiousness; and depression severity.

Participants also completed a measure called ""personality inventory of psychopathology"" which assessed all of their personality traits.

Researchers then examined whether participants with BPD performed differently than the average person. They found that those with Borderline Personality Disorder showed significant differences in their scores on all four measures.

Those with Borderline Personality Disorder scored higher than average on openness and conscientiousness but lower than average on depression and neuroticism, which suggests that these traits could impede successful employment and contribute to poor social behaviors.

Siegel said there's no reason to think that these results mean that people with Borderline Personality Disorder aren't capable of working in organizations. In fact, he added they may actually be able to do better than the average employee due to their unique strengths.

These qualities include being strong thinkers and problem solvers. For example, if someone with Borderline Personality Disorder shows that they're highly analytical and problem solving, that would help them find ways to solve problems in different contexts. These skills also make them good leaders.

Thyroxine is essential for thyroid hormone synthesis, and when it fails to produce enough thyroxine (hypo) TSH rises because TSH binds more strongly to its receptor on the pituitary than does T4 [17]. Hypothyroidism can cause a range of clinical abnormalities including sleepiness, fatigue, depression, mental confusion, muscle weakness, poor concentration, appetite changes, weight loss and decreased sexual function [18]. The most common features of severe hypothyroidism are elevated body temperatures (hyperthermia), tachycardia or orthostatic intolerance. This condition occurs in 50–85% of patients with chronic autoimmune thyroid disease [19-22], whereas the incidence of severe hyperthyroidism is much lower and that may not be associated with a diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid disease [23, 24].

The role of hypothyroidism in the development of Graves' disease was first suggested by Beggs et al. [25] who demonstrated a significant association between hypothyroidism and Graves' disease in an Australian population (n = 874). Subsequent studies have also been conducted using different methods to confirm this finding. In a study from Germany involving 479 patients with Graves' disease only 5% had evidence of hypothyroidism and the median age at onset of Graves' disease was 55 years (range 35–63 years; P < 0.0001) [26]. A cohort of 793 hypothyroid patients attending a hospital in Denmark found that all hypothyroid cases were younger than 65 years [27]; however, these results cannot be extrapolated directly to the general population. In a prospective study of over 700 patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PRMS) in Finland, only 11% of patients with Graves' disease met the criteria for hypothyroidism [28].

In a cross sectional study of 115 patients with Graves' disease in Japan, hypothyroidism was reported by 15% of patients with Graves' disease compared to 1% without hypothyroidism [29]. As expected from other authors, those with hypothyroidism were significantly older and had higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders (P < 0.05). These findings support the hypothesis that hypothyroidism plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Graves' disease. However, the exact nature of the relationship between hypothyroidism and Graves' disease remains unclear as there has been little investigation into the possibility that hypothyroidism causes specific",123,hypothyroidism symptoms,-1.747349500656128,21,no_prompt,6,0.12962962962962962,361,12

The company's chief executive, Tim Cook, has said that Apple is making a ""radical"" move to create a truly mobile future where everything is connected and it will help determine how we live our lives by bringing all the devices into harmony. The new iWatch could be an attempt at getting people on board with this vision. It can connect to your iPhone wirelessly through Bluetooth or use NFC to open doors in stores as well as pay for things at checkout counters. And since it uses the same processor found in Apple Watch Series 2 (which is expected out early 2018), it should also have faster performance than the first model which debuted in 2016.

With the launch of the Apple Watch Series 3, however, Apple is moving away from its reliance on cellular connections and instead focusing on Wi-Fi connectivity. For example, when you order a meal from the restaurant app on your watch, it asks if you want to take a call before actually placing the order. If you say yes, the order gets placed using Wi-Fi and then connected via Bluetooth to the restaurant's server. If you decline to place the order, it does not send any data back to the server.

Nerve cells (neurons) communicate with each other via electrical impulses called synapses. In healthy tissues, neurons release neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, glutamate, noradrenaline and serotonin into the surrounding extracellular space. These neurotransmitters act on other nerve cells, thereby creating the neural ""synapse."" Synaptic transmission can be broken down and re-established at any time; however, synaptic plasticity is impaired during disease conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), ALS, stroke and spinal cord injury [1]. It has been postulated that chronic activation of microglia in some cases leads to an inflammatory reaction resulting in reduced activity within neurons. Chronic infections have also been implicated as a factor contributing to the formation of microglial scar tissue in regions of the brain affected by MS [2]. This process is referred to as myelin loss [3], which increases the risk of neuronal dysfunction and subsequent neurological symptoms in MS patients. A number of studies suggest that excessive levels of oxidants may play a role in this process [4–6] and thus contribute to the pathogenesis of MS [7–9]. One study reported that mice lacking the enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) exhibited progressive neurodegeneration upon experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Furthermore, several animal models have demonstrated that prolonged exposure to low doses of oxygen and/or hyperbaric pressure (HBPs), which mimic toxic insults to the brain caused by infectious agents or toxin exposure, lead to the accumulation of lipid rafts in neurons [10–13].

The role of oxidative stress in neurodegenerative disorders remains poorly understood because it is difficult to demonstrate direct evidence of elevated oxidative stress. Several mechanisms have been proposed for how oxidative stress could contribute to CNS damage. The most commonly accepted theory involves increased reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated DNA damage, which results from the binding of free radicals (free radical scavengers, superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, etc.) to nucleotides, especially those present in mitochondria, thus generating double strand breaks (DSBs). Such events appear to result from direct inhibition of mitochondrial respiration resulting in elevated ROS levels.

This is a simple, inexpensive way to lower your glucose levels and keep blood sugar in check!

How does it work?

A single tablespoon of coconut oil contains 10 grams of fat (4% DV), which has been shown to prevent insulin resistance and the onset of metabolic syndrome. This makes coconut oil an excellent option when trying to lose weight or improving overall health. Coconut oil can also help with inflammation due to its high polyunsaturated content (3).

Coconut Oil & Diabetes Risk Reduction

In addition to being great for losing weight, we should consider using coconut oil for other health benefits as well, specifically:

Possible Protection Against Type 2 Diabetes

There have only been a few studies on coconut oil and type 2 diabetes prevention, but they suggest that low-glycemic index foods may be beneficial for preventing this disease. For example, one study found that adding 1 tbsp of coconut oil to meals reduced fasting triglyceride by 22%. Another study found that people who used avocado oil for just 6 weeks had greater reductions in blood pressure and waist circumference than did those who ate traditional oils like safflower oil or peanut butter. A study published in Nutrition Journal found that after 7 days of consuming either 20g of lard per day, 15g of olive oil or no oil at all, both group improved their glycemic control and lipid profiles. This suggests that high consumption of saturated fats could reduce blood glucose spikes when you eat carbs – something that many diabetics experience, so reducing the intake of these unhealthy fats might improve our blood sugar control! The bottom line: It's possible to enjoy a healthy diet without consuming too much refined carbohydrates and avoiding the use of whole grains. However, if your goal is to limit carbohydrate intake, then make sure to include plenty of fruits and vegetables along with lean meats, fish and eggs, and don't skip the fiber.

Increased Energy Levels

The main benefit of eating more calories from coconut oil seems to be increased energy levels. Several studies have reported that coconut oil can increase metabolism by as much as 30%, which means you'll feel fuller longer – especially if you've already consumed some kind of protein or carbohydrate. It appears that fat provides energy because it helps us burn calories through oxidation rather than storage. Therefore, instead of storing excess energy in the form of stored body fat, the extra energy is burned up via metabolism and used again. One study showed that individuals who consumed coconut oil for three months experienced better results in terms of body composition",22,my risk for developing type 2 diabetes,-10.658689498901367,214,no_prompt,6,0.856,436,14

What is phase II?

In this stage, the patient's disease has progressed from the first stages into a second or third one:

Secondary demyelinating polyneuropathy (SDP)

Primary demyelinating polyneuropathy (PDP)

It can be difficult for patients with ALS to know how many years they have left. It is important that we communicate clearly to them what the end-point will be as well as what treatment options are available to us during that time. This should help patients understand their situation and plan accordingly. We do not want our patients to feel like it may all come crashing down at any point in time and therefore provide regular updates on the progress made throughout the clinical trial. At the same time, patients can be reassured that there is no indication that progression towards SDP or PDP is inevitable, that their disease continues to improve and that it is possible for improvement to occur regardless of their ongoing symptoms.

How is my ALS treated during Phase I?

During this first phase, the aim is to prevent further deterioration of the nerve fibres, which allows the patient's muscles to regain function. If you experience weakness or numbness in your limbs or hands, these might indicate residual damage from the onset of disease. To improve movement and mobility, we recommend using prosthetic devices such as braces and/or splints for support, rather than surgery. There are also some options to enhance quality of life through physical activities (such as swimming). Your doctor can guide you through the details of how best to manage your condition.

During Phase II, the focus is on restoring control over motor functions by modifying the neuroprotective drugs used to treat the initial stages of the disease.

The results of the study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, show that a compound called pyrrolidone carboxylic acid is able to boost levels of the brain's own natural ""energy source,"" glucose, which can help speed up a person's response time when they are presented with an unexpected stimulus such as a loud noise or light. The findings may hold promise for treating neurological diseases like MS by boosting the body's energy reserves, said lead author Dr. Paul Greengard, director of the University of Michigan Center for Neuroprotective Nanomedicine at U-M Medical School.

""These molecules have been used before to treat MS but we haven't had any success until now,"" he said.

This is not the first time researchers have discovered a substance capable of improving cognitive function through a mechanism related to insulin signaling. In fact, studies into this type of therapy have shown promising benefits for patients with epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. One of these recent studies, published earlier this year in the journal Nature Medicine, found that mice treated with a small molecule similar to resveratrol appeared to retain more memory cells following surgery and thus improved their cognitive ability compared with the control group. However, those results were based on only one particular study involving just 10 mice, so further research is needed.

Greengard and his colleagues analyzed data from over 3,000 people who participated in the NIH Study of Osteoarthritis and Related Disorders that examined a wide range of factors that impact health outcomes. These included factors including blood pressure, cholesterol levels, obesity, diabetes, smoking status, physical activity level, diet, alcohol consumption and educational background. Using information provided by participants, researchers developed a computerized medical record database that they then tested against three different measures of cognitive performance: working memory (the ability to remember what you're supposed to do next), verbal fluency and attention/concentration abilities. Working memory includes the ability to process incoming information while simultaneously maintaining focus and completing tasks. Verbal fluency tests how well people understand words and sentences and has previously been linked to better cognitive performance. Attention and concentration, meanwhile, involve using both your mind and hands to solve problems.

gpt2-xl_93,"Sleep problems are known risk factors for MS. These include difficulties falling asleep, sleep disturbances, waking up during the night or not being able to get back to sleep, nightmares, memory loss after waking (flashbacks), poor sleep quality, and difficulty getting out of bed, even if tired. This is called insomnia. Studies have shown that people with higher levels of stress hormones (cortisol, epinephrine) are more likely to suffer from sleep problems. People who suffer from other health conditions such as depression are also at increased risk.

A study by Hwang et al, 2013, found a link between insomnia and fatigue, which may be due to the fact that many patients on a disability pension do not sleep well anyway!

Many doctors believe this is just an association; there are no strong scientific evidence to suggest that sleeping problems cause MS. However, some people with MS have reported being able to fall asleep easily when they were on medication to treat their symptoms. In addition, researchers have found that women with MS are twice as likely as men to experience daytime sleeping disorders - such as insomnia and trouble sleeping. Therefore it seems logical that these two factors could play a role in causing MS.


What should I do about my insomnia?

If you think your insomnia has started to affect your daily life then take action:

Take a rest break from work

Keep away from bright lights or any stressful activities

Limit screen use, TV watching, internet browsing, phone use, playing games etc. If you find yourself doing this regularly make sure your employer's policy is clear that this is allowed

Try to avoid driving, taking public transport, going out at night and getting involved in large social gatherings. These can all aggravate your problem

Talk to someone about trying to cure your insomnia

Avoid alcohol and drugs

If the insomnia is affecting everyday aspects of your life then consider seeing a doctor. Sometimes insomnia has been known to improve with antidepressant treatment. Ask your GP or specialist whether medication is right for you. They will be able to advise you about what treatments work best for you.

Other causes of sleepiness

Some people may develop excessive sleepiness for no apparent reason, including:

Dyskinesia - the condition where movement is impaired because of muscle spasms.

gpt2-xl_72,"The use of this vaccine has been in debate. The company that manufactures it, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are both reviewing a new study by researchers at Boston University School of Medicine to see if people who take multiple sclerosis medications can safely receive the vaccine. They found some people with MS have antibodies against the part of the virus (the Langerhans cells) used in the vaccine but not others. So while many doctors agree that there is no reason to think the vaccine should be stopped, other doctors say there may be a need for an investigation or safety review before it's given more widely, particularly since the doses being used now aren't very high — about the equivalent of one shot per week on average.

How does the vaccine work?

The Langerhans cells are a type of white blood cell found all over your body; they're also called helper T cells. These help the immune system identify foreign bodies and respond to them. The vaccines uses those helper T cells as ""antibody donors"" — the cells that make the protective antibody are harvested from a patient with MS and then injected into another person who doesn't have MS.

Why do you recommend the HPV vaccine?

Because two types of human papillomavirus (HPV) are linked to cancers of the penis, anus, mouth, throat, vagina, rectum, oropharynx and cervical glands, according to the CDC. In fact, 90 percent of sexual partners of men diagnosed with prostate cancer will get HPV, and about 70 percent of women infected with HPV will contract cervical cancer during their lifetimes. Both kinds of HPV affect more than 16 million Americans, especially teenage girls, making it a highly prevalent sexually transmitted disease. Some studies indicate that up to 80 percent of young girls will develop pre-cancerous lesions in their genitals and oral cavity by age 21. HPV vaccination is considered to be an important preventive measure against these cancers.

What does the FDA know about the HPV vaccine?

On Feb. 4, 2009, the agency announced its first ever action regarding the HPV vaccine — requiring companies to prove the vaccine protects against two strains of HPV that cause most cases of genital warts and cervical cancer. Those regulations were later revised to include three additional types of HPV. In June 2010, GSK received a final FDA authorization for Gardasil 9, which was designed to prevent HPV6/11/16",72,Is the Covid-19 vaccine safe for people taking multiple sclerosis drugs?,-0.1971995532512664,45,no_prompt,6,0.2112676056338028,407,38

In another study, researchers at Boston Children's Hospital found similar results for patients who took Tysabri after their first episode of MS. They also found that taking an oral form of the medicine significantly lowered levels of inflammation caused by a specific protein known as interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is seen in many cases of autoimmune disease. Researchers believe these findings indicate that Tysabri may help protect against a recurrence of the condition.

As for other MS medications currently available, most are designed to lower levels of IL-6 rather than lower MS symptoms. For example, rituximab — sold under the brand name Soliris — blocks the production of immune cells called activated T cell receptors, which play a role in the development of MS lesions.

We identified the 9-item questionnaire as used by several surveys, including the General Social Survey of the United States [ 17 ], the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children [ 18 ] and the British Household Panel Study [ 19 ]. We therefore considered that it was an appropriate tool for assessing mental health problems among children in Canada. A summary score is reported at each level of mental illness, which ranges from 0–4. The higher the scores, the more severe the disorder. Scores can range from 2 to 25, with lower values representing less serious disorders and higher values representing more serious conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), developed in 1997 [ 15 ], has been widely used internationally to evaluate erectile function (EFI). According to the authors, IIEF is a reliable and valid assessment instrument for men aged 16 years and older who have not had sex within 6 months or are having difficulty achieving an erection. It is based upon two questions: ""Do you currently experience difficulties obtaining or maintaining an erection?"" and ""Have you had a history of sexual dysfunction, such as premature ejaculation, premature orgasm, and/or erectile dysfunction, during the past 12 months?"". The answers to these questions were summed and divided into three categories: no problem, mild, or moderate to severe. For comparison purposes, we also examined the same data set containing questions about physical health. The mean score ranged from 3.5 to 4.8, which indicated that most participants scored between 1 and 4. In addition, the distribution of the mean scores showed that nearly half of the men had scores between 2 and 5 and only a minority had scores below 2. Thus, our sample was very similar to the general population. The IIEF has proven useful in evaluating erectile functioning in populations and has been validated in many countries [ 16, 17 – 20 ]. However, the reliability and validity of the IIEF have been questioned [ 21 ]. Therefore, there is still debate regarding whether the IIIEF would be an appropriate tool in estimating ED.

This time, instead of just standing up straight, I'm going to make sure that my shoulders are in a neutral position at the top of each rep. Once again, I need to stretch my legs out and open them up as much as possible so that my back is not rounded. (If you're like me and your arms end up hanging down, here's how to fix it). Then, once again, I'll take deep breaths and bring my knees toward my chest. Finally, I will do one more set with no rest until I've completed all 12 reps (which should only be about 20 seconds), then repeat for 30-60 seconds on each side.

For this workout, I want to work primarily on my quads because they get the most attention during squats, deadlifts, and bench presses; however, if any muscle groups feel weak or tight, then focus on those first! It may also help to go heavy – 6-8 reps per set (but remember, you can always add weight later if necessary). And by ""heavy,"" we mean anywhere from 80-100% of 1RM, which means that your goal shouldn't be trying to max out at the top of each rep but rather keep the weight moving up and down and focus on keeping it close to that number. For example, when doing an 8×12 squat, try to go right past failure and finish with a weight equal to your bodyweight! Don't cheat by taking 10 seconds off between sets to make it look easy. Instead, start light enough that you feel comfortable with the weights and that you have control over how far you're pushing yourself, and don't push too hard to the point where you lose control of your form. This way, you won't put unnecessary stress on other muscles that aren't working as hard as your quads.

Researchers from the university analyzed data collected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on food sales between 1990 and 2009. They found that while Americans are more likely than ever to buy fresh fruits and veggies, the portion of calories consumed from those foods has declined in recent years. In fact, people have eaten less fruit per capita than they did in the 1960s, when USDA data first began being recorded.

The study was published online today in The Journal of Nutrition.

For the new study, researchers compared consumption trends over time for oranges, apples and pears and other common fruit and vegetable products in grocery stores across the United States. They used data from the USDA Food Surveys collected annually since 1991 and compared them to current nutrition recommendations: Eat five servings of fruits and vegetables each day; get half your daily protein intake from whole grains; limit saturated fat to 10 percent of total calories; and reduce red meat consumption to six ounces or fewer per week.

Since the early 1970s, the average American has been eating about 7.5 cups of fresh fruit and vegetables per year, but this figure fell by almost one-third during the past decade. Fruit consumption also dropped nearly nine percent among children and teens, even though their nutritional needs increase as they age. Meanwhile, red meat consumption increased by 16 percent.

""We're seeing people who are much leaner and healthier,"" says lead author Dr. Anne Campbell, director of the Center for Weight and Health Studies at the CU School of Public Health. ""But we've never really seen declines in nutrient density, especially fruits and vegetables.""

Campbell cautions that more work will need to be done to determine if changes in diet play an important role in these trends. While the average person may feel healthy when he or she eats more fruits and vegetables, there is still an underlying issue of lack of access to healthy foods.

""It seems like our culture is so focused on processed foods, convenience foods, fast food — anything that can put you into a rush or make you happy right now — that all that focus doesn't necessarily translate into healthiness,"" she explains.

Still, Campbell hopes her team's findings could help change that attitude. She points out that Americans can enjoy plenty",96,most efficient and sustainable diets,-12.211380958557127,36,no_prompt,6,0.4,423,14

This does not mean that my knowledge has any relevance for understanding psychotherapies. But at the risk of sounding too self-important, here's where I would start: The definition of ""psychotherapy"" as given by DSM IV-TR states:

Psychotherapy means the process of dealing with emotional distress in oneself or one's loved ones through discussion and exploration of problems which are often difficult to face alone (American Psychiatric Association 1994).

It also describes how patients should work together with their therapists in an environment free from judgmental statements, intrusive questions, and demands regarding answers. It says nothing about how we can get to know each other better. It seems pretty clear that many therapists feel they must use techniques based on the theories and practices of Freud or Jung that were developed before the 20th century. But there is no empirical evidence that these approaches are effective, and even if they were, they cannot take the place of actual therapy.

What are the psychological processes underlying addiction?

This is actually a fairly tricky question. In fact, just looking at definitions like ""addiction"" will probably turn out to be misleading. For example, ""addiction"" refers to a number of different behaviors such as overeating, drug abuse, gambling, etc., but it doesn't specify what those behaviors are doing to our bodies and minds. We don't think of the behavior itself as addictive, nor do we assume the causes for it are necessarily genetic. As we learn more about how the brain works and why certain habits become repeated, we may come up with new ideas about what kinds of behaviors might cause us to develop compulsive patterns. Still, we do tend to associate the word ""addiction"" with physical dependence on substances.

But what about addiction when it isn't physically dependent on drugs? Perhaps the most common example of ""behavioral addictions"" are sexual disorders such as erectile dysfunction (ED), porn-induced ED, sex addiction, and various forms of pathological lying. These aren't really disorders because they involve thoughts rather than bodily functions. They are still behaviors that we wouldn't normally consider harmful, and they're probably more likely to be caused by brain chemistry than genetics. If you want to understand these issues, you'll need to look further into neurochemistry. (For",53,what is psychotherapy?,-1.0931466817855835,14,no_prompt,6,0.07777777777777778,410,6

Signs and symptoms of Bipolar Disorder:

Depression or hypomania is the most common feature of bipolar disorder, with about 15 percent of those affected having a manic episode. Anhedonia - lack of pleasure in things that normally make us happy - can also be an early symptom of bipolar I, as it may be more pronounced if someone was treated for depression early on. However, anhedonic symptoms are less likely among people who were diagnosed earlier than this. Depression can manifest itself in many ways, from loss of interest in activities to weight gain and fatigue. Individuals may feel sad, irritable, anxious, angry, hopeless, depressed, restless, paranoid or have thoughts of self harm. Many times, these mood swings last only a few days before returning back to normal.

Bipolar disorders can lead to psychotic episodes characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and/or manias. During these episodes, individuals experience delusions where they believe that they're experiencing physical illness such as being possessed by demons, devils, aliens or gods, or even that other people are trying to cause them harm. While there's no clear evidence linking these events to bipolar disorder, it's thought they may be associated with the illness and contribute to the risk of psychosis.

A person with bipolar disorder is not always aware that he or she has these mental health conditions. It can take time to recognize the signs of bipolar disorder because it typically goes unnoticed until the illness becomes more severe.

There is no known way to stop the body's natural process of producing insulin.

It may also help if your doctor prescribes the drug metformin. If your doctor does not prescribe metformin, then you may be able to control your condition by taking an insulin analog such as Humulin R (Humalog), which can be bought online from various websites like Walmart and Amazon.com, or at your local pharmacy. However, Humulin R comes at a cost ($110/month for a 30-day supply). If you cannot afford this expensive option, then a cheaper alternative such as Metformin is available. There are many other types of drugs that can help to control the symptoms associated with type 1 diabetes but they all require a prescription and must be taken every day. Once again it is important to remember that there is no way to reverse the disease.

Is it possible to have diabetes without having type 1?

Yes, because sometimes type 2 diabetes develops after people lose weight due to obesity, even though their blood glucose level remains under control. You should check with a physician before making any changes in your lifestyle. Type 1 diabetes does not always occur when people gain weight. Sometimes type 2 diabetes occurs in combination with type 1. In some cases, type 1 can develop later on. Your doctor will look for the signs of both conditions and determine whether one of them warrants treatment.

""Our study shows that if you are a woman who is at risk for early-stage ovarian cancer, there may be some benefit to giving yourself an over-the-counter supplement called zinc gluconate to help reduce your chances of developing it,"" says senior author Dr. Elisabet M. Ljungqvist, a researcher at Uppsala University Hospital and Uppsala University Clinic.

The new research is based on data from about 400 women with early stage (stage 0) ovarian cancer, who were randomized into two groups: One group received daily oral doses of one gram of zinc gluconate per day, whereas the other group took no supplements. Both groups continued taking their usual medical care throughout the trial. All the participants underwent surgery and chemotherapy, as well as radiation therapy, after undergoing tumor biopsies to determine stage 1 and 2 ovarian cancers.

After 16 weeks, both groups showed similar disease recurrence rates, but the zinc-supplemented women had lower cancer recurrences overall, according to the analysis. When compared with those receiving either the placebo or no supplemental zinc, women who received zinc gluconate experienced a 43 percent decreased rate of total ovarian cancers, 54 percent reduced rate of all stages of ovarian cancer, and 30 percent less incidence of late-stage (stage 3+) tumors than did non-zinc-supplemented patients.

Researchers note that many more studies are needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn about whether zinc gluconate will actually prevent ovarian cancer. However, they say, ""This preliminary finding suggests that high-dose zinc might have clinical benefits when taken by healthy women.""",118,stage 4 triple negative breast cancer treatment,-13.122085571289062,204,no_prompt,7,0.9147982062780269,266,4

gpt2-xl_77,"Dr. Michael H. Pritchard, M.D., of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and colleagues looked at the relationship between menstrual cycle length and other factors that may play a role in MS (1). They found evidence for this association among women with MS who had been diagnosed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans as part of an ongoing study over 14 years. These studies were conducted by researchers from five countries: France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland. The investigators examined data from about 10,000 women with MS, with about 1% reporting they had had their first episode within the past 5 years and another 4% saying they had had their last episode within the past 12 months. They also assessed the presence or absence of other symptoms, such as headaches, backaches, fatigue and depression.

The scientists analyzed the results of three different models of MS pathogenesis. One model focused on changes in immune system activity linked to aging, inflammation, cell loss, autoimmunity and impaired blood supply. Another included a greater risk for developing MS if women smoked during pregnancy; a third addressed the link between ovarian failure and MS. Of these three models, only one accounted adequately for several of the observed relationships, Dr. Pritchard said. This suggested that the remaining two models might be more predictive of MS than did the previous two.

In general, women who experienced a shorter period had significantly increased risks for MS. Among those who had been diagnosed after the age of 30, the relative risk was twice that of women whose menstrual cycles were longer than 35 days, compared with women whose periods were shorter than 25 days. Women who had experienced a miscarriage were almost four times as likely to develop MS.

Other factors associated with higher MS rates include having older siblings, higher levels of obesity and diabetes, and being exposed to environmental toxins like benzene before conception. Those who had suffered from a history of miscarriage were eight times more likely to have developed MS. And those with a family history of MS had twice the odds of developing MS than those without such a gene mutation.

gpt2-xl_97,", but their effect on cognition is less clear. Although some have argued that exercise can improve cognitive function (4), others question whether exercise has a significant impact on human cognitive processes such as memory and attention in healthy adults (5).

In this study we used a novel design to test the effects of daily aerobic fitness training on working memory performance, and examined whether it could modulate the relationship between brain volume loss and age-related decline in cognitive functioning. We found that participants who were physically fit had significantly greater hippocampal volumes at baseline than those who were not fit. This result was consistent across three measures of hippocampal volume: cortical thickness in parahippocampal cortex, fractional anisotropy of the hippocampus, and mean diffusivity.

We also tested whether these differences in hippocampal volumes predicted performance in a working memory task. Participants completed two tasks designed to assess general short-term memory. Working memory capacity was assessed by requiring them to recall a list of four numbers and then to complete one number-digit combination while ignoring other digits, as well as by requiring them to remember and execute a complex multi-step sequence of movements in response to cues presented either immediately or after 5 min delay. An additional measure evaluated short-term verbal fluency, which includes both the ability to identify words and to manipulate them into sentences.

Because the relationship between volume and performance changes with time, we investigated whether change in hippocampal volume over time predicts performance in our working memory task. We hypothesized that the effects of aerobic fitness training would be greatest in the elderly, because these individuals are more likely to experience hippocampal volume loss before they reach middle age (6). To address this possibility, we included participants aged 60–80 y old in our analyses and analyzed results separately for young and older age groups. Results showed that there was no difference between performance in all participants according to age group, suggesting that fitness training did not affect performance in all older participants. However, when examining only younger participants we observed an inverse relation between volume loss and working memory performance for the older age group, suggesting that the effect of age on hippocampal volume change was due to changes within that population rather than aging itself ( ). This result supports the idea that physical exercise can influence neurocognition through its effect on hippocampal structure.

There are several limitations of this study that warrant discussion. First, although we conducted extensive structural imaging during the resting state, this does not necessarily imply that the hippocampi were activated during the working memory task; therefore",97,benefits of physical activity,-10.064180374145508,131,no_prompt,7,0.5874439461883408,435,9

However, you can see how some areas would be more sensitive than others if your skin isn't used to using products like these.

The risk of stillbirth depends on a number of factors such as the stage of pregnancy at delivery, maternal age, race or ethnic group, gestational diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Stillbirth rates can vary greatly depending on where women live, which health care providers provide prenatal services, whether they receive prenatal care during pregnancy, what types of health care they choose to have, how long they have been pregnant and whether their pregnancies were planned before conception.

Prenatal Care Services That Can Improve Delivery

In addition to prenatal care that includes medical tests and ultrasounds, many health centers offer prenatal vitamins with vitamin D2. Pregnant women who take this type of prenatal vitamin will be given an estimated 80-fold increase in their levels of vitamin D. This increased vitamin D helps improve blood clotting and may help lower the chance of developing bleeding during childbirth. Women should also consider taking vitamin K2 (Menadione) if they aren't getting enough iron from their diet, since it can prevent neural tube defects, including spina bifida, by increasing calcium absorption. Another prenatal supplement that has shown promise for improving delivery and decreasing stillbirth risk is folic acid. If you're not sure how much folic acid to take, talk with your doctor about which form works best for your particular needs. Folate is found naturally in foods like leafy green vegetables, fruits and beans. Too much folic acid can impair brain development and lead to developmental disorders later in life. Taking folic acid supplements in addition to other prenatal vitamins may reduce the likelihood of having a child with an intellectual disability.

The Role of Genetics in MS

Why is the cause still unknown? Why can't scientists find a cure for this terrible illness? This section answers those questions.

What causes MS?

Does this mean that every child born today has a one-in-a-million chance of developing MS at some point in their lives? No! There is no absolute risk factor associated with being born with MS; however, genetics play a large role in how someone develops MS. A person who has a parent with MS may also be at higher risk than other children due to genetic differences between siblings. People with certain genes like APOE, which increases the likelihood of having MS, also tend to have other health problems that make them more vulnerable to developing MS.

Most research into MS focuses on one gene called APOE. The human body makes a protein called apolipoprotein E (APOE). It helps protect our brains from damage caused by free radicals during exercise, exposure to sunlight, and various environmental pollutants (like pollution, cigarette smoke, heavy metals, lead, and benzene), but unfortunately APOE is faulty. While many people with MS carry mutated versions of APOE, almost everyone carries a normal version of the APOE protein. However, when the mutation occurs in a particular location within the APOE protein, the receptor APOE4B, it leads to the production of toxic compounds that build up inside the brain, causing the neurological symptoms associated with MS.

This means that, even though a person may carry a mutated form of APOE, the cells lining his or her brain will continue to produce abnormal amounts of these chemicals as long as the mutated APOE proteins remain functional. So, while everyone has a very small chance of developing MS in the future, one of the main ways the disease progresses is through overproduction of harmful substances and inflammation in the brain that can begin decades before symptoms appear.",54,What does multiple sclerosis diagnosis include?

In contrast, only about 10% of those who have a diagnosis of schizophrenia believe they are in fact suffering from schizophrenia. In other words, even though people with schizophrenia may appear to suffer from many problems, they often experience more anxiety, depression and confusion than those without the illness. This is largely because they do not feel that these negative feelings can be attributed solely to their mental illness. People with schizophrenia tend to think that they are being treated as if they were ""normal,"" despite their symptoms and the fact that they are generally unable to function well or concentrate at work. They may be experiencing social withdrawal or even becoming hostile towards others. It is important for professionals caring for patients with schizophrenia to understand this difference between how those with this illness perceive themselves and what they tell family members and friends.

She will likely explain it away by claiming she misunderstood something that happened in the previous hours.

There could be several reasons why a person with schizophrenia would use such language when talking to you:

2) He simply needs reassurance that she understands how angry and upset he feels.

3) His behavior indicates that he is trying to change himself so that his behavior won't be seen as irrational or out-of-control.

But until now scientists did not know why these two groups of cells were involved in disease processes.

Researchers suspected that autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis might involve changes in other types of immune cells called regulatory T cells or Th1 cells. In a recent study published online May 16, 2015, in Science Translational Medicine, Dr. Knoepfler's team showed for the first time that patients who developed MS after receiving multiple sclerosis drugs developed changes in regulatory T cells that might explain their symptoms.

In addition to the mouse model used in the new research, which was previously established as the best animal model for studying neurological disorders associated with aging and autoimmunity, researchers studied mice infected with the simian version of human herpesvirus 6, HSV-6. These mice had no detectable virus but nevertheless had a similar profile of the human form of the disease. They found evidence that HSV-6 caused a rapid loss of tolerance to immunosuppressive medications in the blood.

The investigators found that while the mice lacking the viral protein lacked both a normal level of antibodies and a specific response to anti-HSV-6 drugs, they still tolerated some of them well enough to continue their lives. This suggests that this group of animals could one day help develop therapies against HSV-6 infections.

Dr. Knoepfler noted that while the work has uncovered clues about the role of this type of cell in MS, additional studies will be needed to confirm whether it could lead to drugs targeting the cellular abnormalities in order to treat or prevent MS.",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-10.819249153137209,144,no_prompt,7,0.7309644670050761,374,3

Treatment

It's important to discuss treatment options before starting any type of psychiatric medications. Some medications used to treat ADHD (e.g., methylphenidate, atomoxetine) should be started early enough in life that they will have plenty of time to work before needing to be continued indefinitely. In most cases, this can be accomplished by introducing the medication gradually over several months; however, if your child has been diagnosed with ADHD prior to age 3, it may be necessary to start with one dose of the drug per week until he or she reaches adulthood. Your doctor can help you decide when to introduce the medication.

If you take medications for your children, you may want to talk about how much of them each will need to start taking at different ages. If you're considering using stimulants on your own, consult with your pediatrician about dosage guidelines.

Medications that might cause side effects include antidepressants, benzodiazepines (Valium, Xanax, Klonopin), anticonvulsant drugs (epilepsy medicines, gabapentin), anti-psychotics (Clozaril, Risperdal), antipsychotics (Lamictal, Seroquel, Seroquel), sleep aids (Allegra, Lunesta",107,medication adhd anxiety,-1.0031630992889404,3,no_prompt,7,0.023255813953488372,318,5

Treatment

Are there any effective drugs for treating Multiple Sclerosis (MS)?

There are many medications available to treat MS. Medications include:

Antibiotics

Anti-inflammatory agents

Central nervous system (CNS) stimulants

Chronic painkillers

Chemotherapy

Other anti-infective drugs (eg, cephalosporins)

Radiation therapy

Some oral medications

These medications may have side effects and/or require dosing adjustments. Some also must be taken daily as needed during the course of treatment. Some studies have shown the ability to reduce relapse rates after discontinuation of therapies like steroids, antibiotics, and chemotherapy by up to 50%. A recent study in Germany showed that people who were treated with riluzole for 2 years had a 60% reduction in their relapses compared to patients not taking riluzole.[1] Another study found that the median time from relapse to improvement was 15 months in those who took riluzole while 5 months among those not taking it. The study noted significant improvements in brain lesions including spasticity, stiffness, and neuropathic pain.[2] If you have other medical problems or are pregnant, consult your doctor about the benefits, risks, and restrictions regarding these medications.

A recent study indicated that most patients who received riluzole for 2 years experienced an overall benefit and improvement in symptoms,[3] although some did experience side effects. This study demonstrated a trend towards faster decline with continued medication, suggesting that this may not always be the case. There was no difference between the groups in their disease activity scores after 24 weeks. However, there was a statistically significant difference in disability from baseline at 12 weeks and 18 weeks. In addition, patients receiving riluzole had significantly lower levels of MS-related cognitive impairment and less disability than placebo recipients.

Although medications such as riluzole appear promising, more research needs to be done, particularly long-",55,How to manage multiple sclerosis?,-0.6208574175834656,11,no_prompt,7,0.044715447154471545,371,11

This is a very common problem that occurs with a lot of computers. The computer needs to make some calculations, and it can't get the results from memory because there are no more values available on the chip. When this happens, you have to ""read"" the data from the RAM into your own computer's memory. This is called an I/O error. You need to figure out which bits were actually used by your program to calculate what you wanted. For example:

If we want to compute 2*pi (or any other number), then we will first try:

x = x + 1

The above would result in 6, but the computer couldn't take the number into its own memory and store it. Instead, it will use all six bits as one big number. So, how do we tell what was really calculated? What was 0 or 1? By counting which bit is not set and compare that value with those that are:

1 == (bit 5) - (bits 3-4)


Since bit 4 is NOT set (it is always clear which bit is zero, so that makes sense for a simple example like pi). Then we know that bit 5 is zero. Now we can calculate it:

2 * pi * 4 = 720 * 740 = 3500


You may be wondering why these numbers don't fit into your computer's memory. Well, they aren't stored in large enough amounts to store them in a single byte! In fact, if you took the largest number possible (3500), and put it inside your computer's memory, it would occupy about 2.7 megabytes (and that's just the biggest number possible!). We're going to go over how to solve this problem in order to get our desired answer.

To start off, remember that every time your computer performs an operation, it has to move certain bits around to reach the required result. If you look at each bit, you'll see that it is connected to three others. These connections are called ""bit wires"". Each of the four wires in a line represents a different amount of ""data"". Let's say that each wire represented a 2 bits of data. From left to right: A=1 B=2 C=3 D=0. To represent this in binary form, we will say that the following code looks like this:

A=0111010

B=00000100

In a trial involving 24 MS patients, researchers found that three different forms of antioxidants improved memory and cognition. The supplements included vitamin E, lutein, beta carotene and zinc as well as an antioxidant called resveratrol, the researchers report online today (June 4) in Neurology.

""The results were consistent with what we saw in our previous study,"" says principal investigator Dr. Michael Sivak, an assistant professor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School in Boston. ""It was remarkable to see that these antioxidants could improve memory, particularly for people who had been severely fatigued."" [10 Foods That Are Good For Your Brain]

Previous studies have shown that reducing inflammation may protect neurons from being damaged by oxidation, but many researchers think there is not enough evidence yet to recommend antioxidants or other anti-oxidants as treatments for all types of MS, Sivak told Live Science. Previous trials examining other antioxidants did not find benefits for people with milder forms of the disease, he said.

However, in this latest investigation, researchers took blood samples of 11 participants before they began taking the supplements and again after six months. They also asked patients to complete tests measuring cognitive function, such as attention and short-term memory. At the end of the 12-month period, 14 percent of those taking the supplements showed improvements compared with just 6 percent of those taking placebo — a statistically significant difference, which means it may be worth trying the treatments on your own if you want to see measurable improvements in your symptoms, Sivak said.

While some research has linked low levels of antioxidants in the body to MS symptoms, others have suggested that the nutrients are protective against MS progression. In another recent study, researchers from the University of California, San Diego reported in the journal Neurology that people who take daily doses of vitamins C and E for two weeks prior to getting the MRI scan performed better on the test than those who didn't.

Sivak noted that the new findings don't mean everyone should start taking dietary supplements for their MS. Instead, he recommends that people consider using an antioxidant supplement as one part of their overall health plan, along with regular exercise, eating good foods and avoiding certain drugs like aspirin and statins.

""This is the first time that we have been able to show a single gene-linked risk factor for all three main clinical stages of MS,"" said senior author Dr. Mark A. Kieffer, of the Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine at the University of California, San Diego. ""Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that some patients are at increased risk of developing MS as they age.""

In the study, researchers analyzed data from more than 3 million people in two large Danish studies and found that those who had developed MS before the age of 45 were twice as likely to develop the disease as those older than 50. The risk of relapsing-remitting MS rose by 1 percent each year after age 45.

The overall association between the age at which someone has received an injection of interferon beta and the likelihood of later developing MS was similar in both observational studies -- meaning it wasn't due solely to random chance or bias -- suggesting that there may be a specific genetic component to this link. However, when the researchers looked at individual patients' genetic information, the results did not reach statistical significance. They suggest that further research may be needed to determine whether this phenomenon can be replicated using other biomarkers.

Although it's not clear how interferon beta causes these changes in the body, the scientists speculate that it could involve several different mechanisms, including changes in immune system activity or cell signaling systems related to the brain. They also think that exposure to certain chemicals in air pollution might trigger a chemical reaction in the body that leads to a change in immune response.",57,multiple sclerosis stages phases,-10.228394508361816,42,no_prompt,7,0.2028985507246377,278,1

Can someone pass my inherited genetic disorder to their children or grandchildren?

The laws governing this are very specific in many states. Generally speaking, if you inherit the disorder from at least one of your parents, no one can pass the disease to their offspring unless the gene involved was detected by testing during pregnancy. However, there are exceptions that may apply depending on where you live and what the condition was when you were born. If both you and your spouse carry an affected gene, your child can't receive any compensation under the law because the genes involved aren't known. Your partner's child may receive compensation if she/he inherits two copies of either gene (two affected parents) or all three genes (one affected parent and two unaffected siblings). Children without affected genes may also qualify for compensation. For more information see our article about inheritance of hereditary diseases.

How can I find out if I have a genetic condition or disorders and which ones are covered?

It depends on the state. Some insurance companies will pay for certain medical tests. Most do not. To learn about the coverage available in your area, contact the Insurance Information Institute. The Health Resources and Services Administration website lists all of the agencies that make up the federal government's National Comprehensive Cancer Network, including the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration.

You'll need to go through some hoops to get a copy of your records, but once you've done so you can use them to determine which treatments are covered. The Health Resources and Services Administration also provides a list of insurance companies in each state. It might take awhile to find out what is covered and how much.

METHODS:

We used data collected as part of the NHS, which includes information on a wide range of health outcomes for more than 80 million people in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We analysed data up to 30 May 2013. All causes of death are linked to the registration code (http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/downloads/dataset_albany-cafepress.xls). A population attributable risk was calculated for each cause using standard methods. Cox regression models were used to examine associations between caffeine consumption and mortality from all causes and from cancers. Hazard ratios were adjusted for age group, smoking status, alcohol consumption and physical activity level. Caffeine intakes were assessed by means of four frequency questionnaires. The results were combined with other studies showing an inverse association between coffee intake and cancer or mortality from different types of cancer, to estimate the total effect.

FINDINGS:

The pooled hazard ratio (HR) comparing high vs low intake was 0.94 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.93 - 0.96; P =.004); no significant heterogeneity (P =.84) across study sites, gender or cause of death. High vs low caffeine consumption was associated with increased risk of death from cancer (2.03 per 100 g/day [1.70 - 2.61]; HR, 1.59, 95% CI, 1.27 - 1.97; P <.001), but not from cardiovascular disease or respiratory diseases (0.99 per 100 g/day [1.35 - 2.08]; HR, 0.88, 95% CI, 0.75 - 1.06; P =.12).

The present study was not designed to evaluate the association between cigarette smoking and the development of type 2 diabetes, and therefore cannot demonstrate causality. However, our results do suggest that smoking may increase risk for developing this disease by increasing oxidative stress and inflammation.

Smoking cessation is associated with improved insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic individuals, but it has also been reported that tobacco use increases insulin resistance in diabetic patients as well [16]. In addition, smoking reduces insulin secretion and release from pancreatic β cells, which are involved in glucose metabolism and insulin secretion, respectively [17–19]. Our findings suggest that increased ROS generation during chronic cigarette smoking could be involved in these metabolic disturbances, resulting in more insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. Although smoking does not affect blood pressure or heart rate, there is evidence suggesting that smoking is associated with elevated C-reactive protein levels [20, 21], and elevated concentrations have been associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease in both men and women [22]. We found significant associations of smoking status with high plasma concentrations of oxidized LDL (P = 0.02) and serum total cholesterol (P = 0.04), and decreased HDL-C and triglycerides (P < 0.001). These data indicate that the relationship between smoking and lipid profiles can vary according to gender and race/ethnicity. Furthermore, we observed a positive dose-response relation of smoking and markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in the entire population.

We investigated whether the relationship between smoking and cardiometabolic health might depend on other metabolic variables such as inflammatory cytokines. When comparing persons who smoked and those who did not, we found that persons who were physically inactive had a higher prevalence of obesity compared to their non-smoking counterparts (14% vs 8%, P = 0.004; Table 1A). This finding implies that regular physical activity prevents or ameliorates the adverse effects of smoking on cardiometabolic health. As many studies find that active people have lower plasma lipids than sedentary people [23, 24], we found no relationship between smoking and plasma lipids. However, when analyzing the whole sample, we found that overweight/obese participants were significantly less likely to smoke than normal weight participants (27% vs 27%, P = 0.03). Thus, it appears that low weight individuals with a history of being overweight may benefit from quitting cigarettes.

This will not only help you feel better, but it will also make your muscles more flexible for lifting, jumping, and other activities that require high levels of stability. It's important to stress that these are just suggestions; there is no need to do them all out of order or in isolation from one another. A good starting point would be to incorporate a few of the following stretches after every exercise:

Legs

Hip Flexors

Lower Back

Shoulders

Calves

Abdominals

The first thing you should notice when doing the above exercises is how much more relaxed they make you feel, especially if you have been sitting for too long. The next part is the most important: Your body will relax as you get closer to failure (i.e., you'll want to start with lower repetitions). As you approach this point, your core will tighten up so tightly that you may not even be able to hold a plank properly! If you can't reach this point by yourself, ask someone else to help.

These three stretches will leave you feeling stronger, more mobile, and healthier than before you started working on your flexibility. They're easy to implement and provide a ton of benefits. Do some research on what type of exercise you're already doing to see what works best for you. In addition, try incorporating several of the previous stretches over time to work on getting comfortable with the movement patterns required. After a few days of practice, you might find that you're able to perform all five movements without needing assistance and then continue adding these stretches as you gain confidence.",130,neck and shoulder stretches,-10.669774055480955,31,no_prompt,7,0.4492753623188406,315,8

The study was published in the journal Cancer and Steroid Biochemistry & Molecular Biology.

""We used to think that metastasis was a death sentence,"" said lead investigator Dr. Anupam Jena, of Mayo Clinic's Research Institute for Regenerative Medicine in Rochester, Minn., and the University of Minnesota. ""This study shows that even in cases where there is extensive metastases to distant organs or tumors, we can improve survival by targeting those areas.""

Dr. Mark S. Daley, director of the National Cancer Institute's Center for the Cure of Breast Cancer, called the findings ""exciting news.""

""While it may seem counterintuitive, this study demonstrates that if you stop the tumor from growing before it reaches other parts of the body, you will significantly increase patient outcomes,"" he added. ""If it is done early enough, treatment with these compounds could greatly reduce overall mortality rates associated with breast cancer.""

More than one-third of all women diagnosed with breast cancer die from their disease within five years of diagnosis because they have little or no chance of surviving the disease. While some patients are able to fight off the cancer once it has spread, many others succumb.

In a previous analysis published in June, Dr. Daley and his team reported that treating late-stage breast cancer with an approach based on the concept of chemotherapy-induced systemic inflammation (CIS) resulted in improved survival rates among patients who had undergone surgery and radiation therapy.

To understand how breast cancer metastasizes, researchers analyzed the genomes of 1,200 women who were treated at three different Mayo Clinic centers between 2003 and 2009. Using new cutting-edge genomic sequencing techniques, the scientists identified nearly 600 genes involved in cell growth and programmed cell death -- the two mechanisms known as apoptosis and necrosis that govern whether cells commit suicide or remain alive and healthy. By analyzing the genomes of each woman, the researchers discovered that more than 80 percent showed signs of either a malignant or nonmalignant state at the time of their first appointment with a physician.

They then examined the gene expression patterns in the cancer cells and found that the same genes expressed differently depending upon the stage of the tumor: when the tissue was already inflamed or was advancing rapidly toward being invasive. The researchers also demonstrated that they could block these molecular processes using different combinations of drugs that act on different cellular pathways.

Using these data, the investigators tested which combination of drugs would offer the best chance of helping the",117,stage 4 metastatic lung cancer outcome,-9.971757888793944,81,no_prompt,7,0.32661290322580644,416,8

This means that your thoughts, emotions, physical sensations, and behaviors are different after you've experienced a trauma than they were before.

The question is: How do we understand how this happens in our brains? And how can we get past it? What's the best way to treat PTSD?

In a study published today in PLOS One, researchers at Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, and New York University describe new imaging tools for studying brain activity during the course of treatment. These techniques might help doctors pinpoint which patients respond well to specific treatments—and give them the hope that their conditions could be overcome with treatment.

""It would be very helpful if we could identify whether certain people will benefit from certain therapies,"" says Matthew Lieberman, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and senior author on the paper. ""But even more important, I think, is understanding how to intervene when someone has recovered enough to go back into therapy.""

Lieberman and his colleagues developed sophisticated software that maps out brain activity in real time as participants are exposed to stressful images while undergoing functional MRI, a technique that allows scientists to observe changes in blood flow in the brain during cognitive tasks. The team's system can tell not only where in the brain the most significant change occurs but also exactly which parts of the brain are active—which is key information for helping to tailor interventions.

Using these methods, they measured two types of activity in the brain: decreased activity in areas associated with emotion processing, such as the amygdala; and increased activity in regions associated with sensory processing and attention, such as the hippocampus, a structure involved with learning and memory.

These patterns helped distinguish between people who responded well to one type of treatment and those who did poorly. For instance, people in the first group showed increased activation in a region called the insula, which helps regulate feelings of fear, anxiety, and sadness. People in the second group showed increased activity in another part of the insula known as the cingulate gyrus, which regulates emotional responses. The results suggest that both groups were responding to trauma through different networks.

One possibility is that many people have multiple responses to trauma. For example, the study's subjects who had higher levels of reduced activity in their insula might be better able to",53,what is psychotherapy?,-12.818320274353027,173,no_prompt,7,0.9611111111111111,428,3

Diagnostic procedures

Blood tests

CXR (cytokine receptor) screening is useful for screening for C. difficile.

Antibiotics

Antibiotic prophylaxis is usually indicated in patients who have an ongoing or recent history of antibiotic therapy, especially if the patient has recently received a high dose. Patients with recurrent diarrhea may benefit from additional oral antibiotics as well. Oral clindamycin 500 mg daily for 7 days should be considered.

Surgery

Clinical examination is important to identify complications of Clostridium difficile infection in which surgery can help control infection or facilitate management. The need for surgical intervention was seen in 75% of all cases with C. difficile infection treated at one facility. Most often this involves removal of infected peritoneal fluid or fecal material, although excision of part of the colon may also be required. The procedure is generally performed under general anesthesia, though local anesthesia may be necessary when there are no contraindications or significant morbidity. It can take up to 3 months for the surgeon to complete the operation; once the problem has been diagnosed, the patient can return home within 10 days. If the condition worsens after treatment, the patient may require hospitalization until the inflammation subsides.

Prognosis

If you contract C. difficile infection during your stay at an infectious diseases center, it's likely that you will recover completely and experience only mild symptoms, including fever, abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, and sometimes diarrhea or bleeding. In most situations, these symptoms resolve after 1–3 weeks without medical attention. However, severe infection can cause serious problems such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, shock, and death. In addition to dying, people infected with C. difficile may lose weight, suffer from malnutrition, and even die prematurely.",108,chronic diarrhea short-term memory sweating inability to regulate body temperature heart palpitations dysautonomia,-7.609310150146484,16,no_prompt,7,0.2711864406779661,312,6

I've got an old piece of wood lying on the floor between me and the wall right now because it doesn't have any weight, so I can work on getting more mobility from this exercise. This will be my next test.

The last piece of wood I picked was a block of wood with an old tire rolling underneath it. This will help increase my range of motion for the trunk flexion exercises.

Before starting these exercises, you want to make sure that you are warmed up properly and get yourself comfortable with the position you will be taking part in. Try to keep the arm overhead as much as possible. There should only be tension on the elbow joint when pushing down on the top of the shoulder blade (should look like a cross between the shoulder blades and armpits) and not anything else. If you feel any tightness or discomfort while performing the exercise, stop immediately and do them again another time before moving onto the next set/rep. When doing these exercises, try to stay relaxed while moving through each repetition. Also, keep your head slightly lower than normal during all movements.

There are 2 ways to perform these exercises: 1. To do both sides at once; 2. One side for each hand.

To address this issue, we sought to examine the relative contributions of these two parameters in relation to risk of ovarian cancer among postmenopausal women in California using data from a population-based cohort study conducted during the period 1988–2003 that included a representative sample of healthy postmenopausal women aged 45–69 years.

Materials and Methods

Study Population

The women who participated in this study were enrolled as part of the Nurses' Health Study II; they are referred to hereafter as participants. The protocol for recruitment was approved by institutional review boards at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard School of Public Health and the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. Participants provided written informed consent before participation. Eligible individuals completed a baseline questionnaire in 1994–1995 or 1996–1998 at which time their age at menopause was assessed with an annual physical examination, including measurement of height and weight. Participants received periodic questionnaires through 1999; they also were asked whether they had ever used oral contraceptives, were currently taking hormone replacement therapy, and if so, the name, type, dosage, duration, and intended length of use. They were also interviewed about other health characteristics (including tobacco smoking status), reproductive history (such as number of children), family history of breast or ovarian cancers, and current dietary intake during the previous year. In addition, blood samples were collected after an overnight fast in 1994–1996 and 1997–1999 to assess fasting serum insulin concentration, waist circumference, and fasting plasma glucose concentration. Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were measured with standard methods with commercial kits available from Abbott Laboratories. Blood samples were centrifuged immediately after collection and stored at −80°C until assay. Fasting serum total cholesterol concentration was calculated as described previously.26 For this analysis, serum total cholesterol concentrations above the upper limit of normal (<130 mg/dL) were considered borderline abnormal.27

Statistical Analysis

To evaluate the relationships between risk factors and ovarian cancer, we first estimated the proportion of individual women who would have developed ovarian cancer according to each factor if all other variables were held constant while controlling for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. This analysis indicated that only BMI was associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer. After adjusting for potential confounders, increasing BMI (as defined as body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared] × 2.38) was significantly associated with a 24% increase in relative risk",126,birth control suppression antral follicle count,-13.242338180541992,80,no_prompt,7,0.6837606837606838,403,0

Treatments for the symptoms include: medicines that relieve nausea and vomiting such as paracetamol or ibuprofen; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac, aspirin, naproxen and ketorolac; and beta blockers. There are also several herbal remedies available to treat nausea associated with Herniated Disk Disease (HDD). Some examples of these remedies include St John's Wort and Ginkgo biloba. These remedies may not provide relief for all patients experiencing nausea but they may help some people manage their symptoms.

In a survey undertaken in 2009 among 991 adults aged 18 years and older who experienced moderate to severe nausea at least once per week, 5% reported taking an herbal remedy.

I've always had an interest in medical research, and it was my professor, Dr. Peter Fonagy at UC Davis who introduced me to this topic in high school. He showed me some videos from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke on Multiple Sclerosis (NINDS). I remember thinking ""Wow, there must be a cure for MS."" So, I studied neuroscience under him, went through his PhD program and got a master's degree with the goal of becoming a researcher. My specialty is neurodegenerative diseases, so I thought it would be really cool to study the brain and stem cells of MS patients. After completing my doctorate and then doing postdoctoral training at NINDS and Stanford University, we started working together on what is now called the Brain Project. We were interested in understanding why and how people develop MS and how these changes contribute to disease progression. Our focus was on understanding how the brain responds to inflammation or infection and how these mechanisms might lead to disease development. This was all well known, but there wasn't much funding available for scientific research in my field, so I decided to do something different. I started my own startup company, Neuropathology Inc., which is based in Santa Barbara, California. In addition to providing clinical trials services, we are also developing tools and technologies to better understand the brains of patients affected by multiple sclerosis.

What has been your biggest challenge so far?

In our early days, we found ourselves in a lot of trouble because we couldn't obtain any patents for our discoveries; however, we have successfully sued off many companies who tried to patent ideas and products based on ours. The most difficult challenge has been getting the FDA to agree that our studies are valid. They wanted us to prove that our methods work first, which they said was impossible because the studies don't involve mice, rats, cell lines, etc. However, we did show in two published papers that our method works on human TMS-activated neurons in vitro. That gave them reason to approve our studies for drug discovery purposes.

How can researchers make more progress with such promising approaches?

One of the keys to finding new treatments for multiple sclerosis is to understand the basic mechanism of inflammation in the disease. Current therapies target only one part of the process – reducing immune activation – and while they help reduce symptoms, they may actually increase autoimmune processes. To find out where MS starts and how it progresses, scientists need to",83,Why get episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis?,-12.076339721679688,220,no_prompt,8,0.9401709401709402,429,21

Is there an age limit to participate in this research?

Our research group generally welcomes participants between 18 and 35 years old. Please note that individuals under 18 are not eligible for all studies at UMSL, including our clinical trials. However, many researchers are accepting children from ages 13 through 18. In addition, some studies require participants to be 16 years of age or older. For more information, please see our website at www.mslsresearch.org.

gpt2-xl_77,"There is a common understanding that the physical changes caused by aging in women and men are related. But how do these changes impact other conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD)? This research will show us if MS and AD are more similar than they seem. It has been known for decades that there is an increased risk of developing both MS and AD when one or both partners have experienced early life trauma, such as abuse or neglect. In the case of MS and AD, this trauma can be due to exposure to environmental toxins, such as lead during childhood. The same may apply in reverse, where MS could be linked to lead poisoning from air pollution. We think it important to look at both types of dementia because the diseases share common mechanisms and clinical features.

What's your personal experience with MS and/or AD? What challenges did you face that led you to pursue the study? I was diagnosed with MS at age 45 after being exposed to environmental pollutants in my home town in East Midlands England. At first, I thought that I just had a bad cold – but the signs were unmistakable! My vision became blurry and my balance deteriorated. I eventually lost consciousness and woke up in hospital. After a year of rehabilitation I regained some use of my body and began to get back on my feet. However, over the next several years I developed severe depression, which had not occurred before the onset of MS. Fortunately, I found help through the National Autistic Society, which helped me to become well again. Since then I have continued to participate in activities which support people living with disabilities.

Do you believe that multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease have anything in common or that they represent two completely separate disorders? No, both diseases have many similarities in terms of their incidence rates, pathophysiology, genetics, neuropathology, treatment strategies and prognosis. However, there is no single cause of either disease. As such, treating each condition should take into account all available evidence from different areas of medicine.

How did you become interested in the topic of multiple sclerosis? About 15 years ago, I decided that I wanted to learn more about our health problems caused by toxic substances.

Although CCD can be caused by many factors, there are certain risk factors that increase your risk. Smoking increases your risk to an even greater degree. High blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, high cholesterol levels, smoking, excessive alcohol intake, and lack of exercise cause plaque build-up around arteries, making them more susceptible to damage. As a result, cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes occur at a higher rate among smokers than non-smokers. A variety of medications may also worsen existing vascular health conditions. Some examples include anticoagulants, blood thinners, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), antiplatelet agents, corticosteroids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), vasoconstrictors, and potassium channel blockers. These drugs often reduce blood flow to arteries, causing damage. The impact on people who smoke or take these types of medications has been well documented.

Other factors that contribute to the development of CCD include:

An aging population with increasing rates of physical decline, osteoporosis, bone fractures, cancer, heart disease, stroke, dementia, and other causes of death.

Decreased muscle mass due to age-related loss of body proteins, especially collagen and elastin

Smoking decreases insulin sensitivity, which contributes to elevated blood glucose levels. Insulin resistance leads to increased production of free fatty acids from stored fat. Free fatty acids release chemicals known as lipotoxins into circulation. Lipotoxic compounds have been shown to stimulate platelet aggregation, leading to thrombotic complications, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary artery disease.

Aging affects the immune system

Immune systems begin to fail at middle ages. This happens because many of us experience chronic infections from the time we're born until well past our retirement years. By midlife, a significant proportion of Americans become chronically ill with certain illnesses such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, allergies, type 1 diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disorders.

What advice would you give to anyone who may have experienced discrimination due to MS?

It's important to find out why this is happening to you. Sometimes it can take some time before you understand exactly why something might happen to you. If you are experiencing discrimination because of your disability you need to discuss it with your manager or HR representative right away. You don't know if they have any preconceived ideas or beliefs about your condition, which could potentially affect them negatively.

Do you feel that there is enough understanding towards people living with MS? Why/why not? How could we improve our knowledge base on MS?

When I first came into work I had no idea of how different MS is compared to other chronic illnesses and how many barriers there were in finding employment and being taken seriously by employers. People with MS face discrimination every single day – even when they show up to work looking fine!

The National Centre for Mental Health has put together lots of information and resources related to MS. There are some really good groups online where people can go to talk about issues surrounding MS and share experiences with others.

If you were able to develop a professional career with MS what advice would you give to a young person with MS who wants to pursue a career in medicine?

I'd recommend seeking help early to ensure you get the best treatment possible, and seek out opportunities to speak to your GP about your illness so he or she knows what to expect from you. You should also look into internships and volunteering opportunities available through schools, colleges and universities.

A ketone body is produced in the liver when there are insufficient glucose resources in the blood stream, but not enough glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) to stimulate the release of insulin. The amount of GLP1 will be reduced by the presence of fat as well as high levels of insulin because fat cells have an inherent mechanism of releasing their own lipolytic enzymes, such as adiponectin. The more fat, the less insulin released which means you require more insulin to convert the food into energy. This causes the loss of water weight, and this can also affect your blood sugar.

Your insulin sensitivity decreases, and it takes longer for insulin to get to the right places in the body. You become hungry much earlier than normal and tend to overeat if you're feeling deprived. Your glycogen stores decrease because they cannot be used as quickly. You don't lose any muscle mass since muscle protein requires anaerobic metabolism in order to break down carbohydrates so you may appear thinner. Your heart rate will increase due to increased adrenaline and other stress hormones that promote cell growth. All these factors can cause you to develop diabetes.

Additionally, excessive eating leads to many more health issues including heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, etc. Therefore, if you suspect that you may have diabetes then it's best to go on a low carb high fat diet rather than a carbohydrate restricted one as your insulin resistance will only worsen over time.

Are ketosis and ketones good for diabetics?

Ketogenesis occurs as a result of fasting or caloric restriction and is a healthy mode of nutrition. Ketones are produced through aerobic metabolism of fatty acids and fats (e.g., from coconut oil, butter, cheese). These ketones help us survive a wide range of environmental conditions including low oxygen environments, intense exercise, or prolonged periods of starvation. When blood glucose falls below the level needed for energy conversion the body converts stored fat into ketones. There are two primary pathways whereby our bodies produce ketones:

The first pathway uses beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB), which is produced directly from fatty acid oxidation. The second pathway uses acetoacetate which is metabolized by pyruvate dehydrogenase, leading to production of acetyl CoA and subsequent transfer of",35,Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?,-0.0558610782027244,3,no_prompt,8,0.01935483870967742,410,16

Consequently, we recommend that patients who are experiencing or have experienced symptoms consistent with ME/CFS receive an assessment by a health care provider to establish the extent of their condition and determine if they need further evaluation for possible underlying conditions. If symptoms persist, patients should be referred to a physician knowledgeable in ME/CFS to obtain more comprehensive medical information before considering other diagnostic testing (e.g., imaging).

Although our recommendations are intended to provide guidance on the most appropriate treatment approach for persons who meet the criteria for diagnosis of ME/CFS, the recommendation regarding diagnosis is based primarily upon the consensus agreement among researchers, clinicians, and patient groups. Thus, this document does not constitute a complete definition of ME/CFS; rather, it describes the most common types of clinical presentations observed in persons whose symptoms do not meet the current diagnostic criteria. While all cases of ME/CFS are likely related to some combination of genetic predisposition, infectious etiology, environmental factors, and nutritional deficiencies, it has been estimated that less than 3% of individuals with ME/CFS are truly ill [2]. A recent article reported on a case of ME/CFS in which the cause was unclear but suggested ""the occurrence of unusual events"" as one potential factor in this individual's illness [7]; however, the author did not identify any specific illnesses that may explain this patient's history of fatigue and cognitive dysfunction, suggesting that there remain many possibilities for causation. Similarly, others have noted that some cases of ME/CFS appear to reflect unexplained ""immune failure,"" and while these patients' clinical picture is often unremarkable, there may also be physiological mechanisms at work. For example, immune-related disturbances may lead to systemic and autonomic responses that lead to exhaustion [8], which could eventually result in the development of a chronic disease. Further research into specific biological causes remains necessary, and the identification of specific biomarkers or biologic markers would aid in clarifying the pathophysiological mechanism behind ME/CFS, perhaps even providing a basis for determining whether a person can safely undergo additional tests such as radionuclide scans.",97,benefits of physical activity,-13.569708824157717,191,no_prompt,8,0.8565022421524664,342,13

Symptoms of Headaches and Migraines

What is the difference between a migraine and a headache?

Migraine headaches are characterized by repeated or severe migrainous symptoms. A headache can be triggered by physical factors such as stress and other stresses in your life. But it also can be caused by the condition called tension-type headache (TSH), which is sometimes called ""neurotic"" or ""migraine"". Tension type headache is usually not associated with any underlying health conditions. However, some people may get a diagnosis of TSH even if they have no known trigger for their headaches. Symptoms are typically:

headache that lasts more than two hours

trouble concentrating or remembering things

feeling dizzy or lightheaded

pain on one side of the head, neck, shoulders, jaw, temples, or back

fatigue or loss of appetite

nausea or vomiting

diarrhea, constipation, or weight gain

rapid heartbeat

loss of hearing or vision

symptoms related to heart problems, including chest pains, low blood pressure, rapid breathing, fainting or sweating, or swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat, arms, legs, hands, ankles, feet, or toes (pinpointed).

Can I get it from my spouse? Is there any way to prevent it from happening?

The risk of getting MS from your spouse is extremely low. However, women who are pregnant should be particularly vigilant because they may pass on antibodies that attack their unborn child's brain and spinal cord tissues.

You need to take precautions against the disease. The best way to combat MS is to live a healthy lifestyle—including physical activity and good nutrition.

In addition, gestational diabetes may occur at any time during pregnancy, but is more likely to affect the mother's body in her first trimester than later in pregnancy. High blood pressure is associated with increased risk for premature delivery. A high blood pressure level during pregnancy increases your chances of having a baby who will be born small or stillborn, have low birth weight (LBW), or have a large head circumference.

Prenatal vitamins There are three types of prenatal vitamin supplements: multivitamins, multi-nutrient pills and prenatal vitamins combined with other nutrients. Each type has its own recommended dosage. Multivitamin/multimineral supplements are safe to take if you eat a healthy diet and get all of the recommended daily allowances from food. If you do not eat enough foods containing iron, calcium or zinc, it is important that you take a prenatal supplement such as a multivitamin and mineral. Vitamin E helps protect the unborn child against oxidative stress. It also protects against oxidation and inflammation which may increase the likelihood of developing heart disease and diabetes mellitus. Some studies suggest that taking vitamin C, either as an antioxidant or in combination with beta carotene, is beneficial to preventing preterm labor. It also decreases the length of the hospital stay for women with prior preterm births. The majority of research on prenatal supplementation suggests that it should be limited to 100 mcg to 300 mcg per day of alpha tocopherols or alpha tocotrienols and 300 mg to 400 mg of vitamin D 3. Most doctors agree that too much vitamin A can pose serious health risks. Too much vitamin B 6, especially when taken in excess, can cause birth defects including mental retardation and blindness. Excessive amounts of vitamin D 3 and calcium can result in kidney damage, osteoporosis and cardiovascular problems. These substances cannot be synthesized by our bodies so they must come from the foods we consume. They work best in conjunction with vitamin B 12.

gpt2-xl_63,"When I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, it affected my work. The day after the diagnosis, I found out that the last two years of my salary had been withheld from my paychecks for disability benefits. My husband and I were both eligible to receive $7,500 per month in Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), but we did not qualify because our income exceeded the SSDI maximum amount each month by $2,000 or more. When I applied to get more money, the VA denied me the increase, saying it would take three months to process all the paperwork. That left us with very little money to live on.


The same thing happened when I returned to work. While my condition improved, my job has become a lot harder since I first started working. It takes many more days to do certain tasks, like cleaning bathrooms in restaurants and hotels. For example, it took over a week just to clean the bathroom at the hotel where we stayed during our honeymoon. So, now I have to find ways to speed up the routine to avoid missing meals while working long hours. And even though I can do some things faster now, there's no way around the fact that I'm slower than before. This means I will need to do several jobs within one business day -- which is something I never thought I'd be able to accomplish until I got MS. In order to deal with this new reality, I've decided to focus on finding other jobs as quickly as possible rather than waiting for the VA to determine whether or not I should continue receiving my monthly income.

What is Multiple Sclerosis (MS)? Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive disease that affects the nervous system. It causes stiffness, pain, loss of balance, fatigue and visual problems in people with MS who have been exposed to an attack of an immune-mediated infection such as meningitis or pneumonia. The symptoms usually appear after the onset of a flu-like illness and often last for several months before slowly improving. The name ""multiple sclerosis"" refers to multiple parts of the brain and spinal cord affected by inflammation. In most cases, MS occurs in the central part of the body — the spine — but it can also occur at other sites, including the arms, legs, hands, feet, eyes, nose, ears, mouth, scalp, bladder, prostate and lungs. There are about 100,000 new MS diagnoses each year in Canada.

There are specific conditions for which homeopathic medicines may be appropriate, such as postpartum depression or chronic fatigue syndrome.

It's very important for patients who have acute pain to consult with an acupuncturist because it can help them manage and treat it more effectively.

The relationship between the severity of the mood and anxiety disorders is complex (Sternberg et al., 2004). In general, individuals with mood disorders are more likely than those without them to have major depression or bipolar disorder (Mayer-Rokitansky & Goldberger, 2008), which can increase their risk for developing schizophrenia later in life. Mood and anxiety disorders also often coexist in people who meet diagnostic criteria for other psychiatric conditions such as substance use disorders, eating disorders, and antisocial behavior (Goldstein & Zaslavsky, 2005). Moreover, some persons with bipolar disorder may have an increased incidence of anxiety disorders (Doblin, Fava, Borsook, & Smith, 1999; Greenberg et al., 2003; Sternberg et al., 2004). The overlap of emotional and behavioral symptoms associated with these disorders may contribute to the overdiagnosis of both disorders in clinical settings (McLanahan, 2006). Thus, the existence of comorbidity among psychopathology diagnoses suggests that clinicians working with both patients with mood and anxiety disorders need to pay attention to this potential confounder when interpreting symptom data.

Schizophrenia

One important finding regarding the association between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia has been reported by several studies (Aston-Jones et al., 2000; Meehl et al., 2007; Nierenberg et al., 2008a; Rothwell et al., 2008b). This association was stronger in younger samples (i.e., under age 45) and in studies conducted prior to the widespread availability of antipsychotic medications. A meta-analysis demonstrated that approximately one third of schizophrenic cases had previously received treatment for bipolar disorder (Izquierdo et al., 2002). Although the precise mechanism underlying this link remains unclear, it may involve disruption of communication between brain regions that support emotion and cognition (Guevara-Rosas et al., 2006).

Neuroticism/Borderline Personality Disorder

Although evidence implicates both depression and anxiety disorders in the pathogenesis of neuroticism/borderline personality disorder (NPD), the directionality of this relationship remains unknown. One possible explanation for the observed overlap between bipolar disorder and NPD involves early adverse life events and stress reactions that lead to impaired coping strategies for managing negative emotions during adulthood (Greenberg et al., 2003). Furthermore, exposure to childhood abuse has been found to",114,borderline personality disorder symptoms,-4.643876075744629,46,no_prompt,8,0.42592592592592593,366,12

""I had no memory, I didn't know who my parents were and I knew nothing about where I was or what I did,"" he says. ""All I could do is crawl around.""

He began to see things in his peripheral vision that he would later realise were invisible objects – like trees and cars on either side of him. His left eye became ""like a camera"", he says.

But even when doctors told him there wasn't anything wrong with him and that it was probably just a case of MS, he refused to believe them. Then one day, while driving near his home, his car suddenly stalled out and he went skidding across the road. The next thing he remembers is waking up in hospital, unable to move his arm. By then, he'd been treated for more than six weeks.

Today, he still can't walk or speak without having to use his right hand, but has made significant progress since then and is now walking unaided and able to talk by himself at home.

The experience gave him motivation to try to help other people living with MS. In 2009, when he started working as an information officer for the charity Open Knowledge Foundation, he began to notice many patients using Google Earth to look for new treatments in their local area. ""I thought, why not?"" he recalls. It took only a few months before he realised how much information he was missing, so he decided to start writing the results down.

After collecting data from around the world, he published his findings in a paper called 'Google earth MS' in 2011, which revealed almost 1,000 new MS drugs being tested worldwide at that time. Today, he's running his own database of more than 6,000 medicines, showing drug interactions with MS and comparing them to similar medications for conditions such as cancer.

While researchers are keen to find effective treatments against MS, many more trials are needed. One study found that 80 per cent of patients taking certain drugs experienced side effects, including dizziness, headache, muscle weakness and numbness in the hands, feet and/or legs. ""That really needs to change if we want a cure,"" says Dr Martin van Gool.

As well as learning more about potential MS treatments, the search for cures also highlights some glaring holes in current medical research. For instance, there are currently no tests or therapies available to detect and treat blood clots in patients who have",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-9.607566833496094,125,no_prompt,8,0.6345177664974619,422,0

Clinicians should screen patients for thyroid problems before they begin treatment with levothyroxine. In a study of 449 women taking oral contraceptive pills (OCP), 25% had evidence of subclinical hypothyroidism in the form of low TSH levels at baseline. This was not observed in OC users who were being treated with levothyroxine.[14] Women on OCs have lower serum concentrations of both total T4 and free T3 than nonusers; however, if this is due to a decrease in free T3 rather than increased total T4, it may be compensated for by an increase in TSH levels. Therefore, clinicians should consider high-normal free T3 as indicating normal thyroid function when evaluating OC users for subclinical hypothyroidism. Clinicians also need to monitor for signs of hypothyroidism during treatment with levothyroxine because clinical improvement or worsening of symptoms may indicate that there has been an initial increase in thyroid hormone production after starting treatment but has subsequently decreased. If such changes occur while the patient is still taking levothyroxine, these patients should be monitored again in 2 weeks and considered for reevaluation. Patients with hyperthyroidism are also at higher risk of developing subclinical hypothyroidism. While thyroid autoimmunity is common among those with autoimmune thyroiditis,[15] its cause remains unclear, although it appears to involve an interaction between thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) neurons and microglia cells.[16–18] In addition, patients with Graves' disease develop thyroid failure caused by elevated T 3 levels and associated hyperthyroidism secondary to immune activation[19]. These findings suggest that the diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism can be challenging in patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases and Graves' disease. For these reasons, thyroid dysfunction should not be confused with Graves' disease. There is no direct relationship between levothyroxine use and autoimmune thyroiditis or Graves' disease. However, patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis tend to have elevated TSH levels compared with controls.[20] It is not known whether this correlation reflects the actual severity of disease in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which is variable, or if the elevation in TSH is simply attributable to a greater sensitivity to thyroid stimulating hormones.[21] Because patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis tend to have higher basal and pulsatile TSH levels, it seems reasonable to believe that patients with a history of thyroid disease would have similar",123,hypothyroidism symptoms,-10.07017707824707,98,no_prompt,8,0.6049382716049383,374,4

Dr. Stoner: You've been studying the effect of fasting on metabolism, and you are one of those who is interested in this question as a possible treatment for cancer. Could it also help to control inflammation?


Alfred S. Stoner: The benefits of intermittent fasting include improved insulin sensitivity; decreased lipid levels; increased glucose tolerance; improvement of blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risk factors; reduction of stress response; modulation of gene expression (e.g., gene expression related to inflammation); inhibition of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1B (IL-1B), which has beneficial effects on tumor development; modulation of immune system functions; and suppression of pro-inflammatory genes such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa).


Intermittent fasting appears to increase the production of fat cells and decrease muscle tissue mass by upregulating adipokines and suppressing adipose tissue protein synthesis. However, long term consumption of these diets may result in adverse metabolic changes including an increase in body weight, serum triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and inflammatory markers (16). This suggests that long-term adherence to these diets requires dietary intervention. In addition, there is evidence that short-term feeding of fasted rats with a high fat diet can lead to liver injury leading to death due to fatty liver. There are several reports showing that prolonged fasts have detrimental effects on pancreatic beta cell function and insulin sensitivity (17-19) and that prolonged starvation has negative health consequences including decreased life expectancy, increased mortality rates from infectious diseases, impaired cognitive performance, and reduced fertility in women and increased mortality rates among males during the reproductive years (20). These negative health effects likely contribute to the poor public health status observed worldwide today.


To address obesity and its link with a wide variety of conditions, the USDA Food Pyramid now recommends an ""eat less"" portion size based on energy needs at each meal or snack time (21). One serving of the pyramid is 25 kcal/meal or 8 kcal/snack. Fasting, however, has many positive health effects beyond reducing caloric intake. It lowers total and LDL cholesterol, triglyceride levels, and blood pressure (22, 23). Intermittent fasting also increases HDL cholesterol and decreases the atherogenicity associated with hyperlipidemia (24, 25). Another study showed that the combination of moderate calorie restriction and intermittent fasting resulted in better mitochondrial enzyme activities and altered transcriptional profiles than did either regimen alone (26).",22,my risk for developing type 2 diabetes,-12.613775253295898,241,no_prompt,8,0.964,386,2

The patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) were assigned to four groups, according to their disease stage: RRMS 1, 2, or 3, in which they had no signs of myelin degeneration and the extent of disability was not significant; RRMS 4 and 5, in which the disease progressed rapidly, but only a small part of the total brain surface area was affected by this disease process; and control group 1 where the other diseases were also present on magnetic resonance imaging.

The researchers found that when comparing the brains of healthy people before and after treatment for different types of MS, it became clear that the difference between the two groups of patients is mainly caused by different immune mechanisms. ""Our results show that there are some important differences among individuals in terms of how their immune system reacts to autoimmune stimulation,"" says first author Dr. Gisela Toth, the corresponding author of the paper reporting the findings. These differences, she adds, could be used as an indication for the efficacy of certain therapies for treating MS.

Researchers at Newcastle University asked about 50 patients with MS (who had undergone randomised controlled trials) whether they experienced any difficulties in sleeping or memory due to the disease. Of these, 26% reported sleep problems and 27% said that they frequently forgot details during the day. Another 15% noted that they could only recall a few words of what they wanted to say when they woke up.

In other words, it is an everyday problem, one that can be expected among any ageing population – but particularly those who are prone to poor sleep quality. The researchers concluded: ""The fact that this was associated with cognitive decline, rather than just being a symptom of the illness itself, suggests that sleep-related problems may be more prevalent than previously thought.""

We don't yet know what causes this type of forgetting. It might be because of the way that brain cells communicate, which makes some parts of your brain much less sensitive than others. Or you may have fewer neurons in certain areas of your brain.

How to prevent it?

If you find yourself waking up several times throughout the night and are unsure why, consider trying out some simple strategies to make sure you get enough shut eye every now and then.

Get plenty of sleep

Sleep is important for keeping our bodies healthy and functioning properly. A lot of research shows that regular sleep has many benefits on your health, including reducing inflammation, helping to stop muscle atrophy and improving heart function.

There's also evidence that getting less sleep reduces the effectiveness of treatments like statins. Regular naps and morning exercises will help ensure you're well rested each day.

Eat a healthy diet

Getting enough protein from lean sources such as meat, fish and poultry is essential for building strong muscles and preventing osteoporosis. Vegetarians, vegans, lacto-ovo vegetarians and pescatarians eat a low fat diet which keeps us burning body fat for energy instead of sugar, so we lose weight naturally without having to count calories or exercise. And if you want to cut down on carbohydrates, try swapping sugary snacks for fruit or vegetables instead.

Get adequate sleep

Sleep deprivation increases the risk of depression, anxiety disorders and dementia. Many studies show that the number of hours of sleep we need in a week fluctuates based on our individual lifestyles and genetic factors.

The authors also found that older, female patients are more likely to have asthma compared with younger, male patients (who are generally more at risk of developing COPD). This may be because women tend to be exposed to a greater number of environmental toxins—including volatile organic compounds like benzene, which has been linked to asthma symptoms in humans.

The study suggests these differences between men and women may partly explain why women who live near major highways or industrial plants are less likely than their male counterparts to get diagnosed with asthma, although they're still much less likely to develop it completely. Women living near such areas are less likely to drive, smoke cigarettes, eat food with high levels of carbon monoxide and other pollutants, work indoors, sit for long periods and so forth. And in addition to air pollution exposure, these factors might influence women's immune systems as well.

Study participants were randomly assigned to receive either nivolumab or placebo for 12 weeks, followed by an additional 6 months of follow-up. During the first 2 years of the study, patients received nivolumab at a dose of 20 mg/m2; this dosage was selected based on previous experience with a similar formulation of nivolumab and in light of recent data suggesting that low doses of nivolumab may be effective in treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer [17]. Patients who did not respond to nivolumab had their dosages increased until they achieved complete response. After completing treatment with nivolumab for two years, we included the patients in a second phase II clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of 20 mg/m2 nivolumab combined with fingolimod (40 mg) and gemcitabine (5 mg). We performed analyses comparing the completers of both phases I and II of the Phase III clinical trials using Cox proportional hazards regression models.

Methods

Participants

A total of 1882 subjects from 5 American centers participated in the Phase III studies: 1 center conducted only the primary analysis and 16 centers conducted both secondary and primary analyses for each patient [18]. Participants were recruited between June 2012 and February 2015; approximately 96% of eligible patients provided informed consent. Eligible patients had clinically relevant disease (International Prostate Cancer Foundation Stage IV disease as described elsewhere [19]) at enrollment; 741 patients (84%) met all inclusion criteria and underwent assessment. Of these 741 participants, 11 patients failed to meet eligibility criteria because they had unreported comorbidities or baseline tumor pathology (defined as evidence of neoplasia within the past 3 years). A final sample size calculation of 1725 was calculated based on available data regarding age and prostate cancer risk factors [20], but results are presented below with a smaller sample size. The baseline characteristics of enrolled participants are shown in Table 1. All participating centers have policies prohibiting the use of financial inducements for participation. To minimize potential selection bias, there is no information about whether participants completed the study before receiving either placebo or nivolumab. Therefore, we considered those in whom we could not enroll a missing arm to have been allocated to nivolumab irrespective of whether they were",117,stage 4 metastatic lung cancer outcome,-11.206819534301758,103,no_prompt,8,0.4153225806451613,387,6

In fact, there are still many questions about how to best maintain a low-carbohydrate diet in the long run. For example, when I studied weight loss for my master's degree, one of the most common questions was: How do you know if it will work? If someone has high cholesterol or blood pressure and keeps on eating carbs even though they're not getting any better, does that mean they won't get thin? The answer, obviously, is no. They'll probably keep losing weight until eventually they stop – maybe just because it gets harder and harder to stick with low-carb. But we can't say with certainty whether their eventual weight loss will be sustained. It could end up being slow and steady or fast and sudden. The same goes for people who have diabetes (it would depend on the amount and type of carbohydrates). These two groups have different needs and might require very different amounts of dietary carbohydrate over time to stay lean and healthy.

For now, the good news is that, as you lose fat, your body switches from burning stored fatty acids for energy to using ketones instead. Your liver becomes able to convert them into acetoacetate, which is then used directly by muscle tissue. At this point, you don't need to worry too much about keeping weight off, since your body should adapt so that it doesn't burn calories as quickly anymore. You just need to make sure you replace those lost calories with the right fats, vitamins, and minerals – like eating lots of fresh vegetables and fish – throughout the day.",96,most efficient and sustainable diets,-12.108144760131836,34,no_prompt,8,0.37777777777777777,275,10
gpt2-xl_53,"""I think it's a very important concept,"" she says. ""Because when you go through the pain and struggle of trying to be healthy, being in therapy can be incredibly helpful."" She calls this approach ""mind-body"" therapy. It involves talking about your feelings with others—family or friends as well as therapists—to help release the trauma that has taken over your mind and body. This can also help you cope with the painful physical symptoms of anxiety such as heart palpitations.

Although this may seem like an obvious way to cope, many people do not feel comfortable doing so because they fear getting blamed for their disorder and having negative thoughts associated with their condition. They feel embarrassed to discuss problems with anyone else. (If you've ever been in therapy yourself, you know how often that happens.) So people tend to avoid talking about mental illness at all costs. That's why it's crucial to find a good therapist who will give you honest, nonjudgmental feedback on how you're feeling. ""Some therapists are more patient than others,"" she points out. And if you aren't finding the right kind of therapist for you right away, there's always the option of going back to your primary care provider.

The Benefits of Therapy

In addition to helping you process feelings about your illness, psychotherapy helps you learn new coping skills and develop a greater understanding of yourself. Psychotherapists have long used techniques called cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs) to treat patients' emotional reactions and behavior patterns. These methods teach patients new ways of thinking about situations so they don't become stuck in a pattern of bad decisions, anger or avoidance, which can cause distress for both them and others around them.

Psychotherapist Michelle Stilwell shows how CBT can provide a clear path to recovery from depression.

For example, say you suffer from panic attacks. You might try to rationalize your worries by blaming them on something you see or hear outside of yourself. Or you could blame them on a specific event in your life, like your partner leaving you, your job loss or another traumatic experience.

This kind of reasoning isn't effective. Stilwell suggests switching to a more constructive strategy: asking yourself, ""What would make me happy?"" For instance, instead of worrying about the fact that you lost your job or your spouse left you, ask yourself, ""How am I making myself better and happier today?"" A person in crisis might then respond to these questions by using positive",53,what is psychotherapy?,-8.450830459594727,22,no_prompt,8,0.12222222222222222,413,0

This article will show you how it works. But first let's review what type of diabetes is being treated in the U.S.

Diabetes and Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Are Two Types of the Disease Associated With Obesity And Heart Disease, Experts Say

The term ""diabetes"" refers to two different types of diseases: Type 1 diabetes — the most common form of diabetes — and Type 2 diabetes. Both involve high blood glucose (blood glucose) levels which occurs when there isn't enough insulin to keep blood sugar under control. As the body begins to use more insulin than necessary, the blood sugar goes up instead of down. People with diabetes need medication to lower their blood sugar so they don't become diabetic. It's important to understand that even though some people have both types of diabetes at once, the symptoms of each differ.

How Does The Gut Affect Your Health? Gut bacteria play an integral role in human health and disease. Our gut microbiome is the collection of microorganisms found inside our intestines that includes trillions of microbes, including bugs that live as single cells on our skin, digestive tract and gastrointestinal tract. These small organisms have a major effect on the way we function every day — from protecting us against infections, helping our immune system fight invading pathogens and providing a variety of other benefits. One of these beneficial effects is helping to regulate the production of certain hormones like cholesterol. How Do Microbes Impact Diet & Nutrition? Eating healthy foods has many benefits. Studies suggest that eating lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds and legumes can significantly reduce the risk of developing obesity-related conditions such as cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancer. Researchers also believe that diets rich in fiber and plant polysaccharides may protect against obesity by reducing appetite and encouraging regular physical activity. What About Other Fruits?

a heart problem;

liver disease (especially hepatitis);

diabetes;

kidney problems.

If you already use this medicine for other conditions, tell your doctor right away if the effects of loratadine stop working within a few weeks.

It's important to tell your doctor about all other medicines you take, including vitamins and herbal supplements. Do not start or stop taking any new medicine without telling your doctor. This includes prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, herbs and other dietary supplements. Also tell your doctor if you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy. If you become pregnant while taking loratadine, call your doctor immediately because it can harm the unborn baby.

Loratadine can pass into breast milk and may affect growth in babies. You should not breast feed while using loratadine unless directed by your doctor.

How should I take loratadine?

Take loratadine exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Your pharmacist will give you information to help you decide how much loratadine is best for you.

For most adults, take 2 doses daily. You'll usually get stronger results from 1 dose than from 2 doses. The number of doses needed to gain benefit depends on the person. Take one dose at bedtime. A second dose should be taken no later than 30 minutes after waking up. For children under 6 years of age, talk to your child's doctor first.

Loratadine does not prevent the body from making its own antihistamines such as cetirizine (Zyrtec), diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or nortriptyline. These medications must be used in addition to loratadine.

Do not exceed the recommended dose of loratadine. In rare cases of overdose, loratadine could cause serious side effects.

Ask a doctor or pharmacist if it is safe for you not to take some or all of your dose.

In the study, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis treated eight women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had undergone a total of six rounds of chemotherapy. The women received either an intravenous infusion or oral medication to increase their blood levels of two enzymes — EGFR and PDGFRA — that normally suppress growth of a tumor's cells but are also associated with enhanced resistance to drugs used for other cancers. When given during the last four weeks of the trial, the supplements improved survival by three months compared with placebo.

The patients' tumors were located mainly in the lungs, liver and spleen, according to results published online Nov. 29 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Each patient had five previously documented cases of HER2-negative breast cancer and one case of HER2-positive breast cancer. Four of the eight patients relapsed during the study.

""This was a very small study, but it shows that adding these anti-EGFR/PDGFRA combinations can improve response rates,"" said senior investigator Dr. Hsiao-Yu Chen, associate professor of medicine at Washington University. ""It's an example of combining complementary approaches to treat solid tumors.""

Chen is collaborating with a team from Harvard Medical School. In addition to Chen and his colleagues, those researchers include Hsiang-Cheng Tseng, director of the cancer center at Brigham and Women's Hospital; Daniel Gefen, assistant clinical professor of oncology at Boston Children's Hospital; and Robert M. Dierker, Jr., MD, chief medical officer and chief scientific officer of Provenge Inc.

For the new trial, the scientists conducted preclinical studies involving mice that had been genetically engineered to be resistant to PDGFRA. They then studied how the combination affected human melanoma skin cells using a technique called gene editing. They found that the supplements boosted the ability of those cells to kill tumor cells when given after the third round of chemotherapy. Two of the nine patients in the study showed significant improvements after receiving the supplements. One patient was able to complete her final surgery and survived for two more months than she did before the study began. Another woman died from complications related to the disease while in the hospital for treatment.

While the patients were undergoing chemotherapy, the scientists monitored changes in protein expression in their blood and urine.

Do I need an individual occupational health insurance policy when studying part time in the NHS?

In order to be covered by an individual occupational health insurance policy, your job must have been listed as one of the following 'essential services' in the National Health Service Regulations 2005:

A doctor's surgery

An intensive care unit

The specialist nurses' ward

A hospital ward

These specialised services allow the insurer to claim under Section 6 of the Personal Injuries Compensation Act 1993. This means that if someone is injured by a staff member working within these specialties they can make a compensation claim against the insurer.

Why does my university/college pay more than the local authority for me to attend lectures?

Many universities have arrangements with external providers such as Cambridge University Press (CUP), which provide lecture venues for students so that they can use a range of facilities including libraries, exhibition spaces, and public toilets. If you do not want to use CUP lecturing halls then it may not be possible for you to attend lectures. However, most universities and colleges will still reimburse travel costs and accommodation expenses up to a maximum of £500 per term for students attending lectures. Some universities also provide bursaries if you have limited resources and are eligible for tuition grants. If your college has not provided this level of financial assistance for you to attend lectures, then you should consider applying for a scholarship and/or fellowship through CUP.",81,Can I work and study full-time with multiple sclerosis?,-0.0461835339665412,1,no_prompt,9,0.0045662100456621,321,13
gpt2-xl_77,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that affects the central nervous system. It can affect any area of the body, but it's most commonly found in the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms usually begin during middle age or later as your immune system begins to attack the myelin sheath around nerve cells, causing them to degenerate. MS also causes inflammation and damage to other areas of the body as well. Multiple sclerosis often gets worse with advancing age — it may start affecting you at 30 or 40, then peak between ages 50 and 60 and remain unchanged until your late 80s or early 90s. Some people have more than one form of MS: there are many different subtypes based on how they differ from each other. They're divided into three main groups according to their genetic profile: relapsing-remitting and progressive forms; secondary progressive and secondary progressive forms; and nonepileptic focal forms. The three primary types can be further subdivided into two thirds: type 1 (which is rarer), which mainly affects females, and type 2 (also very uncommon). There are also several subgroups within these two categories, including non-inflammatory autoimmune disorders and mixed autoimmune/autoimmune diseases.

The effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for women who've had an adverse reaction to hormone therapy are unknown because of lack of research on this topic. However, some studies suggest that HRT may increase the risk of developing multiple sclerosis, especially if taken long term. For example, an extensive meta-analysis published in 1998 concluded that women taking oral contraceptives increased their lifetime risk of MS by 29% compared with those not taking HRT. Other researchers suggest that estrogen levels in the blood may play a role, but the effect is small enough that researchers haven't been able to detect it statistically.

More recently, another study showed that a drug used to treat breast cancer, tamoxifen, increases the risk of developing multiple sclerosis in women. Researchers studied a group of 516 healthy female volunteers and found that women who took the medication experienced double the number of flare-ups compared with those who did not take the drug. However, the difference disappeared after four years. This could mean that tamoxifen simply made women feel better about themselves, so they stopped trying to hide their illness. Another important finding was that patients were less likely to develop MS when given a combination of drugs known collectively as ""the triple combo."" This included tamoxifen plus raloxifene, desmopress",77,How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?,-3.0708601474761963,7,no_prompt,9,0.028925619834710745,410,18
gpt2-xl_1,"The answers to these questions can help in identifying the potential of cannabis. For example, is there a correlation between disease prevalence and the use of cannabis as an adjunct treatment? In many countries around the world, such as Canada, Holland, Germany and Great Britain, research has been conducted on this question. The results suggest that both chronic liver diseases (e.g., hepatitis C) and multiple sclerosis seem to be correlated with cannabis use; however, it appears more so with the latter condition than the former. It is also important to note that the correlations between different chronic conditions appear somewhat weaker among youth who had used marijuana at least once but less frequently than those who never used it before.

Marijuana use by adolescents and young adults has also become increasingly prevalent throughout Europe and North America over the past decade. As we know from other studies, there is a strong relationship between adolescent marijuana use and subsequent cognitive performance deficits. However, this is not always the case. Studies have also shown that adolescent marijuana use does not necessarily lead to greater alcohol or tobacco abuse later in life. This study found that even after controlling for socio-demographic factors, including sex, age, education level, income, marital status and race/ethnicity, young adult marijuana users were no more likely than nonusers to develop substance dependence. Moreover, they were actually less likely to engage in risky drinking and smoking behaviors, though one could argue that their relatively poor health made it harder for them to quit smoking cigarettes when they did eventually try to smoke marijuana. These findings should perhaps give us pause about trying to ban the drug entirely and promote abstinence only approaches to tobacco control policies. There may not be any negative consequences from underage use alone; if anything, it seems that, due to their lower socioeconomic standing, some teenagers would rather experiment with marijuana because it offers them a safer alternative to traditional substances like alcohol. Therefore, policies should focus on preventing teenage access to marijuana – which leads to increased teen involvement with alcohol and tobacco -- instead of banning the plant outright. Another interesting finding was that although higher educational levels seemed to increase odds of using cannabis at younger ages, this did not correlate significantly with poorer academic achievement. This suggests that while academic success is undoubtedly important, it is possible that the social environment also plays an important role in delaying adolescence into adulthood. Overall, these results show that, despite the growing popularity of marijuana, its effect on cognition remains highly controversial.",1,What are the most common chronic diseases?

Sasha told her story on a recent morning in a small classroom in an old school building in downtown Donetsk. The city was plunged into gloom when separatist rebels seized control last April after two years of fighting with government forces backed by Russia's military intervention.

The war has killed more than 10,000 people since 2014 and forced tens of thousands from their homes as both sides try to gain territory or cut off supplies. More than 1 million civilians are also displaced inside Ukraine, according to UN figures.

Despite the violence, many locals remain optimistic about a possible solution. After all, they say, things seem better under Ukrainian rule than what followed.

In January 2016, a shaky ceasefire between Kiev and the separatists held for 18 months before it unraveled this August. It left eastern Ukraine in chaos, with rebel groups seizing towns, including Mariupol.

While pro-Russian separatists have accused Kyiv of committing human rights abuses and mass killings during the conflict, Kyiv denies any such charges. Some observers fear it may use the upcoming election as a cover to crack down harder on its own citizens.

Ukraine's central government has been struggling to revive the economy since 2014, amid deep financial problems caused by the collapse of oil prices, the currency devaluation and the loss of a huge chunk of foreign investment in the country.

Some say pro-Russians are trying to exploit social divisions to further destabilise Ukraine. Others believe they want peace so they can return home and reap the benefits of a stable economy, which would help them build a more powerful state within Ukraine.

Polarisation in Mariupol

For the past month, protesters have gathered every day outside a local office of the National Security and Defence Council (NSDC), whose director Valentyn Nalyvaichenko has come out strongly against separatism.

A few days earlier, he had resigned and called on other officials to do the same. They did not.

Nalyvaichenko did not respond to requests for comment. A former general who became mayor of Donetsk in 2015 says he is now staying at home. His wife did not answer calls.

The ketogenic diet, also called ""ketosis,"" is characterized by high levels of blood glucose and triglycerides. People who are at risk of having diabetic complications may benefit from a ketogenic diet. These include people who have had complications such as amputation due to the damage caused by high blood sugars. Ketones produced in the liver can help repair damaged nerves and arteries during long periods on a ketogenic diet. A study published in Diabetes Care showed that obese patients given a very low carb (less than 20 grams per day) diet experienced greater improvements in their glycemic control compared to those taking a traditional low fat diet (15-20 percent carbs). The researchers believe that these diets may cause fewer symptoms, including weight loss, because they are less stressful. More research needs to be done before any recommendations can be made regarding the use of this kind of diet.

What does an insulin pump do?

An insulin pump is a device that measures how much insulin your body produces and delivers it quickly when needed. This has two advantages over other types of pumps: 1) You don't have to keep counting; 2) Your body will always know how much insulin you need. An insulin pump works well if you've been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes and are using an oral medication to manage your blood sugar level.

The study, which involved 1,037 adults aged between 18 and 64 years, found that compared with those who did not exercise, those who engaged in moderate levels of physical activity had a lower risk of death from all causes, cancer, heart disease, stroke, chronic lung diseases and diabetes than people who did not engage in this form of activity (including watching television or using computers). The findings were published online today by the journal PLoS ONE.

Previous research has shown that some forms of physical activity are as good for health as smoking, although others may be more effective - particularly if they involve doing multiple activities at once, such as walking briskly along a short distance. However, it is unclear what types of physical activity are most beneficial to health - both physically active people and non-active people have an important role to play, say the authors.

Lead author Dr Jari Tiihonen from the University of Cambridge said: ""For many years there was evidence that being physically inactive could increase your risk of several major diseases. This new analysis shows that even modest amounts of regular moderate exercise can help protect our bodies against certain serious conditions like cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.""

One hundred per cent of participants said that they felt fit and healthy following the intervention programme.

Professor Richard Peto, senior lecturer in public health at the University of Stirling, said: ""Exercise is a vital part of keeping people healthy but we need to know exactly how much and what kinds of exercise people should do to prevent illness or disability.

gpt2-xl_121,", or even just a mild case of the flu. I have my own theory as to what causes this disease.

The bacteria in your gut is called Propionibacterium acnes. It lives on your skin and acts like the tiny version of your immune system. When you get sick, it releases chemicals that create inflammation in your skin (and sometimes elsewhere). The fact that we produce these same chemicals during illness is one of the things that makes us vulnerable to infection. If you were already susceptible to getting an infection, then having more Propionibacteria in your body would make it worse. And it turns out that people who are allergic to Propionibacterium acnes also tend to develop eczema later in life!

When someone with eczema has their hands rubbed by somebody else's pet dog, they develop more P. acnes than if their hand was not touched at all. They may also feel less tender after rubbing their own hands, although there is no evidence to support this claim. Another potential explanation for this phenomenon may be that Propionibacterium acnes acts directly on the receptors on cells, creating new inflammatory signals. This could explain why people with eczema feel so much better when they rub their own hands. But another possibility is that other factors – perhaps those found in our food – can trigger a reaction in our bodies.

There are currently several different treatments available for treating eczema, but none of them seem to work universally well for everyone.

The only real problem is finding a time and place where you can do it without being too obvious about your condition. Once you've developed MS symptoms, however, getting into shape becomes even more important because of how hard it is to maintain your current fitness level. If you're already doing some form of exercise—whether aerobic or resistance training—it makes sense to continue doing so now and then throughout each treatment cycle while you wait to see if you'll improve significantly. Most people who get new medications find themselves feeling quite well immediately following their first dose, but this may not be true of all patients, especially those who are less active at the beginning of a phase 3 study.

First, I recommend that you start by taking a bath/shower after washing your hands to wash away any dirt and germs left in the shower while you're changing into clean clothes. Then let yourself soak for 20 minutes. Rinse off and let your skin dry completely, preferably with no hair covering them.

Next, gently massage a drop or two of your favorite essential oil onto a cotton ball, put some water on top, and rub the cotton around your body for 30 seconds. Rubbing the oil in helps relieve itching and inflammation as well as stimulate blood circulation. It should also help relieve minor aches, pains, and tension. It will most likely take at least 2-3 times to begin seeing results. You'll know when it's time to stop applying because you will feel better and less prone to itchiness.


Now that I have explained how to treat an allergic reaction, I'll explain about treating anaphylaxis, and then describe how to keep yourself safe from possible infections…


Treating An Allergy With Essential Oils

In order to treat an allergy safely, it's important that you know exactly which ingredients are responsible. For example, if you have eczema, you want to be sure not to use parabens (the preservative used to prevent bacteria), as parabens can sometimes cause allergies as well. A common exception to this rule is soy products containing isoflavones. These hormones (most commonly genistein) are found in both soy foods and non-soy sources like cheese, tofu, and milk. However, since many people believe that using soy products containing isoflavones causes anaphylactic reactions (whee!) you may want to avoid those altogether unless you absolutely need to use them.

In the UK a woman's chances of having an abortion after 20 weeks is just over 10%. At 24 weeks gestation there is no risk of miscarriage. By 36 weeks gestation it drops to 2.4% (the same as for women under 18). But at term, about 22% of pregnancies will end with an early termination. The figures are even worse if you're from the Asian community. Women who come into contact with healthcare providers from India or Pakistan face higher rates of abortion than their white counterparts. They may be more likely to have their baby aborted before they reach 21 weeks – when one of the safest times for an abortion is. In contrast, a woman living in North America can expect to have her baby safely delivered at 28 weeks.

Abortion is illegal in England and Wales. The law on terminations for medical reasons was changed by legislation introduced in 2013, allowing abortions up until 13 weeks of gestation. However, while this has made the procedure easier to access, it has not solved the problem of legal limbo. Although terminations for medical reasons now carry a lower threshold in terms of evidence required for permission, it does mean that women must provide some form of consent for any termination during these time periods. In other words, there is still a requirement for consent. This means that many women who wish to terminate their pregnancy do not feel comfortable being counselled about what options exist. As such, they cannot access information on abortion services and, as a result, often go out of their way to seek advice elsewhere. It's also a myth that women with severe mental health problems would use abortion facilities due to stigma attached to them. While some patients may have been referred there because they felt unsafe in hospitals, the vast majority are genuinely seeking help and not avoiding doctors' appointments.

What to think about if you are considering terminating your pregnancy:

• Don't believe everything you read on websites or hear on the radio. These are usually presented by anti-choice activists with little or no clinical training. You should always check the source material before making decisions.

• Consider talking to someone you trust first and ask them whether you might want to terminate your pregnancy.

• If you decide that you wish to end your pregnancy then make sure you get all the necessary paperwork in place and discuss this with your doctor so that you aren't wasting valuable resources.

It is not unusual to have symptoms that last longer than two months, and the risk of getting it increases if you are younger than 45 years old. If you have MS or other chronic pain problems, your doctor may recommend medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil). You should talk with your doctor about any questions you have regarding your specific situation. Your doctor will also ask you about your family history of MS. If you do not get treatment for MS, it may progress to another condition in which the immune system attacks healthy tissue—such as bones and muscles—and causes damage and disability. This type of MS called secondary progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (SPMS), most commonly affects children between 5 and 15 years of age.

Q: Can I work while having MS?

A: Yes. People who are diagnosed with MS are usually able to find meaningful employment after a period of intense rehabilitation. However, some employers may require you to take an unpaid leave of absence for the first 2-3 weeks following diagnosis so they can review your ability to perform your job duties. Some companies offer paid time off in lieu of disability. If you receive disability insurance through your employer's plan, you may still need to use up sick days during this time. Other workers who suffer from MS may qualify for the FMLA law, which allows employees to temporarily put their health at risk in order to care for family members or caring for loved ones with serious illnesses.

""Our findings suggest that an early age at onset of MS is more likely to cause symptoms later in life,"" says Dr. Michael Tylavsky, professor in the Department of Neurology and director of clinical research at the University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio. ""This has important implications for the ongoing search for ways to prevent or delay disease progression.""

The current prevalence of MS varies widely among countries, but worldwide, it affects 1.2 million people each year. People with MS are most commonly diagnosed between ages 20 and 40. The majority develop relapses before they reach age 60. In this study, researchers followed 2,633 men and women from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children of Axford who were aged 18–30 years when their first MS symptoms occurred between 1979 and 2002. They examined how many developed MS after they had been diagnosed as having the condition at any given point in time. When they did so, those with the earliest diagnosis were less likely than others to become affected by the disease in later years; however, only 10% became clinically severe.

Overall, the number of individuals developing MS increased over time in those who started out with an earlier diagnosis of MS compared with those who remained stable. But patients with the earliest diagnosis showed lower rates of MS relapse, which suggests that early detection may not be protective against disease progression. In addition, the risk of developing MS was higher in older adults, especially those who started off with an initial diagnosis later in life.

""These results raise serious concerns about whether people should be told that they have MS when they're younger. The answer might depend on the severity of their symptoms,"" says Tylavsky.

Tylavsky emphasizes that the study cannot prove cause and effect: This doesn't mean that those with earlier diagnoses are destined to develop MS sooner or suffer more severe symptoms than other people – just that the earlier you find out you have MS, the greater your chances of getting the disease later. Furthermore, he stresses that while the rate of progression seems to vary with the timing of diagnosis, there's no reason why this would necessarily hold true across all populations or even within specific ethnic groups.

But Tylavsky points out that there may be potential benefits in avoiding earlier diagnosis. If clinicians can identify people who are at high risk of developing MS, then preventive measures could help keep them",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-1.9728795289993288,18,no_prompt,9,0.08823529411764706,428,0
gpt2-xl_54,"MS is a brain disease that affects one in every 100 people. It's caused by inflammation of the nervous system, and its symptoms can be varied depending on which parts of the body are affected. For some people with MS, symptoms may include numbness or tingling (pins & needles) in the arms or legs, problems walking, severe headaches, fatigue, mood swings, trouble thinking or concentrating, memory loss or difficulty hearing. The condition often begins before age 30 and usually lasts for most of someone's life. There are various theories about what causes MS, but no single cause has yet been identified. Some scientists believe that MS occurs as a result of an immune response to the body's own immune cells that damage nerve cells. Others think MS develops when a person's blood supply becomes blocked after a stroke. Still others believe MS is caused by a combination of factors including genetics, toxins, infections and other environmental triggers. How common is MS? In the United States, more than 4 million people have MS, making it the second-leading cause of disability in Americans after heart disease. In Canada, MS accounts for 2 percent of all disabilities. But MS rates vary widely across the globe. According to the World Health Organization, nearly 50 percent of people living in the world's poorest countries have MS. Where does MS occur? Many different places around the world, from tropical islands to subarctic Arctic regions, experience high levels of MS incidence; these locations are known as ""hotspots."" In the U.S., areas with higher MS rates include: New England states - Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. These three states account for half of all MS cases in the nation.

North Carolina - North Carolina is home to 585,000 new cases of MS each year, while another 860,000 go undiagnosed because they live in poverty or don't get health care.

Texas - Texas is home to more than 80,000 new cases of MS per year, making it the state with the highest rate of MS in the country.

South Dakota - More than 15,000 new cases of MS are reported every year in South Dakota, making it the third-highest MS state. People who live in poverty tend to develop MS earlier than those who make more money. Why do people with MS sometimes appear normal?

And it has been around for decades, but there are very few institutions within the healthcare system which have put this kind of emphasis on it in such an extensive way. It includes things like diet and lifestyle changes, stress management, and meditation – as well as other types of physical activity. It's also about using your brain to help heal yourself instead of relying solely on external forces and treatments.


What are some things you would recommend someone do to increase their chances of being cured from cancer?

There's a lot out there in terms of ""cures"" for certain cancers (breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer etc). But for most people the best thing they can do is live with the illness because one day, it will go away. The first step towards treatment is to learn more about it, so make sure you're educated and stay involved. There are resources online (like www.cancerawarenessmonth.org), newspapers, books, blogs, podcasts, etc., and if you're interested in learning how to talk about it, I'd encourage you to get a copy of our book, The Cancer Whisperer: How To Heal From A Common Illness In 8 Weeks or less.

Inability to sustain stable relationships with others; recurrent and intense emotional reactivity in response to stressors (e.g., loss of a loved one); persistent inability or unwillingness to follow through on obligations; and frequent impulsiveness and poor judgment.

The symptoms of BPD typically manifest themselves during childhood and adolescence, though they can also develop later in life, particularly if an individual has had previous episodes of BPD. At present, no definite cause is known as to why people who have experienced BPD develop their own unique form of the condition, but it does seem that some of these individuals are genetically predisposed to developing certain types of disorders. For example, while genetics doesn't appear to play any part in causing the more severe type of BPD associated with long-term substance abuse problems, there is research suggesting that genes may be linked to other forms of mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and psychosis. There's also some evidence linking BPD to other psychiatric conditions, such as obsessive compulsive disorder and schizoaffective disorder.",114,borderline personality disorder symptoms,-3.240953207015991,40,no_prompt,9,0.37037037037037035,188,2

Methods This study is based on data from the Translational Medicine Unit (TMU), University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, which includes clinicians who treat patients at Penn's Center for MS Research (CMR). Data included all patients diagnosed with relapsing or progressive forms of MS that received an approved investigational new drug (IND) in 2014 or 2015 (or were first enrolled after January 27, 2011). The authors used the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to assess patient demographic, comorbidity, disease duration, clinical outcomes, medication usage, and adverse events. Data on the overall clinical course of patients in this study were obtained by using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) [12]. We collected the EDSS through October 23, 2016. In addition, we recorded information about the following: (1) the timing and length of the initial diagnosis; (2) follow up visits (i.e., the date and location of each visit); (3) diagnoses made, including those coded as ""recurrent,"" ""relapsing,"" ""progressive,"" ""remitting"" or ""non-relapsing;"" (4) medications prescribed during the last month prior to enrollment; (5) the number of days in remission before entering the study; (6) the number of months in treatment; (7) the time from the time of initial diagnosis until enrolment into the study; (8) whether the patient entered the study with or without relapse; (9) the outcome measures assessed for the trial period; and (10) the reasons why patients dropped out, e.g., discontinuation due to failure to respond to treatment.

Results Among 839 patients with known MS, 924 (96%) completed the 4-year study. Of these patients, the median age at initiation of treatment was 49 years (range 12–75) and 84% had been diagnosed by a neurologist within 2 weeks of symptom onset ( ). As noted earlier, 782 patients enrolled during the trial period. After exclusions, 3 participants withdrew before completion of the study while another participant failed to complete the study ( ; see Additional file 1: Table S1 available online). Overall, 29% of participants discontinued their participation within the first year after enrollment (",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-0.0682816207408905,20,no_prompt,9,0.10152284263959391,369,1

How should I take levothyroxine tablets?

Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Do not use if you are allergic to l-thyroxine, levothyroxine, or any other ingredients in levothyroxine. Talk to your doctor about which brand of levothyroxine tablet is right for you. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as possible; this will reduce the chance of having another missed dose. Wait until your blood pressure returns to normal before taking 2 doses at once. Doses higher than those recommended may cause dangerous effects in some people. To prevent unwanted side effects, start levothyroxine with 1 daily dose and increase your dose by 5 mg/day gradually over the first 3 months to reach the maximum safe dose of 15 mg/day. If you must lower your dose or switch from one brand of levothyroxine tablet to another, talk to your doctor. Switching medications is usually easy because most medicines come in different strengths. You can also buy levothyroxine capsules from pharmacies without a prescription. Follow the package instructions carefully.

Levothyroxine tablets are for adult women only. They do not treat menopause symptoms such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, or urinary incontinence (peeing). These symptoms typically appear after age 45 and become more frequent during midlife. Do not stop using levothyroxine tablets unless directed by your doctor to do so.

If you need surgery, tell your surgeon ahead of time that you're taking levothyroxine tablets and give him/her your medical history including how long you've used them, whether you're pregnant, breastfeeding, or trying to conceive. Also include information about any health conditions you have or take drugs for. Your surgeon will decide what type of treatment is best for you.

To help make sure you get enough folate, keep track of how much folic acid you take each day in food, supplements, or liquid forms (for example: multivitamins, fortified orange juice, etc.). This helps prevent anemia, especially in older adults. If you think you're getting too little or too much, ask your pharmacist for advice.

You should not exceed the total daily allowance of folic acid set out in Food and Drug Administration guidelines. Consult your pharmacist for more details.

It is well established that many psychiatric disorders are associated with a poor quality of life. The aim of this study was to establish whether the use of benzodiazepines in patients suffering from schizophrenia-spectrum disorder increases risk of suicidal behaviour or suicide attempts. Data from the UK National Health Service Collaborating Centre for Mental Illness, University College London and King's College London were used to compare rates of admission to hospital due to self harm with admissions due to all psychiatric diagnoses over a 10 year period. Data were derived on diagnoses, age at diagnosis, duration of illness and hospital admission as a percentage of total admissions from April 1st 2000 to December 31st 2007. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was applied to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Patients admitted because they had been treated with a benzodiazepine were significantly more likely to be admitted to hospital than those who had not been treated with a benzodiazepine during the study period. Rates of self harm during the follow up period were also significantly higher among patients with comorbid depression or bipolar disorder, compared to those without these conditions. In addition, in those patients with comorbid depression and psychotic symptoms, treatment with a benzodiazepine increased risk of admission to hospital by an additional 8%. These findings indicate that there may be some evidence that benzodiazepine use may increase the risk of suicide in people with schizophrenia spectrum disorder.

The main goal of this review was to determine if the use of benzodiazepines in individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD), which has recently received growing attention, may have an adverse effect on mental health. We sought to develop information about the incidence of self harming behaviours and hospital admissions in the general population aged 18 years or older presenting to an emergency department (ED) with a medical condition suspected to be caused by the underlying psychiatric disorder. This information will help determine if there is sufficient evidence to suggest that there is any need for benzodiazepine restrictions. Our objectives were to: (1) estimate the incidence rate of self harming behavior amongst individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorder; (2) examine the association between SSRI use and other types of psychiatric diagnosis (such as mood disorder); (3) assess how benzodiazepine use may affect the outcomes of people suffering from schizophrenia spectrum disorder; and (4) investigate the role of comorbidity factors in determining the risk of suicide.",107,medication adhd anxiety,-13.149140357971191,116,no_prompt,9,0.8992248062015504,412,0
gpt2-xl_55,"My son, who is 13, has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). In the UK it's a condition that can affect the brain and spinal cord. It can also involve problems with the eyes or other parts of the body. The disease can cause severe disability in its early stages; later on it causes problems such as headaches, depression and fatigue – so I've tried to find out what works best for him.

As he was just diagnosed last year, his progress and long-term outlook are unknown. He had a relapse two years ago but has recovered since then. We know there are different types of MS and some people do better than others; we don't yet know how many people have a form called relapsing remitting MS (RRM), which means they get their symptoms back up again after treatment is finished. So while my son may not be one of those lucky ones, I think there are some things I can share about managing his MS.


1. Find your strengths

In general, people tend to overestimate the impact of MS on themselves. What matters is having an idea of what you can control. For example:

• If you're someone who likes travelling, this might mean taking an extra day off work or skipping a holiday. But if you like working hard at school and want to keep doing that, that could mean getting help from your GP to make sure you take regular breaks.

• People often underestimate the value of time spent with friends, family and/or colleagues when managing MS symptoms.

2. Set yourself goals and stick to them

Being clear about what you need and want from life will ensure you achieve it. Some strategies include:

• Making a 'to do' list that includes any activities you'd like to try before MS goes away – even if they feel difficult

• Setting an intention to make it happen by writing down a goal and sticking to it until it happens.

3. Learn from others and learn to cope

Learning coping skills can be very helpful. My son knows he needs to get rest now more than ever and I've helped him identify ways of relaxing, eating healthy, exercising and learning new tricks. He also does lots of physical activity and loves running around the garden. These are good opportunities to practice skills we all use regularly.

4. Look out for signs of improvement

Sometimes there's no easy way of knowing if MS is going to go into remission or whether there'll",55,How to manage multiple sclerosis?,-0.0072124348953366,0,no_prompt,9,0.0,424,14
gpt2-xl_95,", I'd like to discuss the way that my mother and aunt used to use the word. The idea was simply this: The more that you know about your own life, the less time you have to learn about other people's lives; thus, using it only once or twice is better than constantly learning from everyone else around you.

When we were kids, my mom would say ""I can't remember the last time I learned something new."" If someone asked her a question she didn't understand, she'd reply with, ""No one ever told me that!"" This gave me an opportunity to ask questions of friends and relatives who had no knowledge of our family background (and presumably their own) — what did they think about my grandmother? What do you think about my cousin's son-in-law? Did he get into Harvard? Had his parents divorced? Why am I so lucky as to be here now? When they couldn't answer these questions, she'd offer them up as examples of the sorts of things I should've been able to find out myself if only I'd read a little bit more and listened harder. This way, she could show me how ignorant she felt when she talked like this. It took some doing for her to actually start asking questions herself — until my sister's wedding, I never really thought anything bad would happen to me because my mom didn't know enough about my family history. But by then, I was too old to care anymore.

It wasn't just my mother who made fun of other people's families on a daily basis. My dad, who doesn't speak much English, would often say things like, ""You don't sound very American"" or ""Don't call yourself Irish."" While these comments were meant as insults, many other times he said such things to show he was proud of his family. I'm not sure what his motivation was at all, but after I got married, I realized that this sort of thing goes both ways. To make myself feel good about being an immigrant, I also became ashamed of my heritage — even though growing up, I knew exactly where I came from. In other words, my dad is a classic case of reverse xenophobia: He hates foreigners, he loves Americans, but he thinks America has lost its soul. You're either an American or you're not. Which is why there are so few immigrants and immigrants are always complaining about all the white people coming here. In my experience, the vast majority of young Asian Americans want nothing to do",95,Reading problems in MS,-14.046992301940918,210,no_prompt,9,0.995260663507109,431,2

The problem with this study is that it doesn't actually measure whether people are going to become diabetic, and even if they did the study would only show that those who started eating more sugar and processed food in childhood were at a greater risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later on than others. The other issue was that these results came from a single-center trial which was not able to adjust for potential confounding factors like obesity or other metabolic problems. This means we cannot tell from this study whether what these researchers observed relates to the overall prevalence of diabetes or to specific subgroups of individuals with an increased risk for developing diabetes. In addition, they didn't report how much dietary sweetener participants were eating. Some studies have shown that people with higher BMIs tend to eat less fruit and vegetables, and so one explanation for the finding may be that those people also tended to consume more sweets. However, most previous research has found no significant associations between BMI and intakes of total sugars (sucrose), added sugars, fructose and whole grains. It's possible that there is something about foods containing high amounts of carbohydrate that is causing them to cause metabolic dysfunction (for example, by raising blood glucose).

For me personally I don't think diet is the main driver behind Type 2 diabetes. I suspect it's mainly due to other lifestyle factors such as insulin resistance (due to lack of exercise) and visceral fat deposition (which increases your body temperature). For some, particularly overweight/obese people, low-fat diets can help (especially when coupled with exercise) but this is usually for short periods of time (2 weeks) and then it often goes back to being unhealthy. People need to make sure their daily calorie intake is appropriate for them to maintain a healthy weight; otherwise they will end up gaining more weight over time. If you're already overweight then losing extra weight (and keeping it off) won't do any good unless you start to change your habits to cut down on energy-dense foods rather than increase calories through excessive exercise.

My advice:

Eat plenty of fruits, veggies, protein and fibre. Try to get enough calcium in your diet. Don't smoke! Have regular physical activity every day. Watch out for the big 4 culprits – saturated fats, trans fats, refined carbohydrates and salt. Eat lots of green leafy veg. There's tons of information available online to help you improve your diet. And always remember the golden rule: if it tastes too good, let it go.",22,my risk for developing type 2 diabetes,-3.180631160736084,94,no_prompt,9,0.376,426,19

Previous studies have suggested a role for interleukin-1 (IL-1) in MS pathogenesis; however, recent reports suggest that IL-6 may also be involved [7]. Previous reports have demonstrated that IL-1β is strongly downregulated in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with relapsing forms of MS and its levels are significantly increased in blood serum of patients after treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs [8]. In addition, several clinical trials conducted at our institution and others reported on the efficacy of an anti-inflammatory drug called TNF-α in patients with MS [9], while another trial showed that a monoclonal antibody against human IL-2 was associated with significantly decreased disability progression [10]. These data provide evidence that TNF-α plays an important role in MS pathogenesis. Indeed, the cytokine has been implicated in the development of new progressive lesions in experimental animal models of MS, such as the mouse model of PD [11]. Interestingly, a study by our group and colleagues revealed that both TNF-α and IL-6 play key roles in the induction of TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in astrocytes and neurons [12].

The present study investigated whether TNF-α could be detected from CSF samples of patients with RRMS. We hypothesized that elevated levels of TNF-α would reflect a disease stage characterized by high concentrations of inflammatory cells and immune activation, as evidenced by the presence of plaques, neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits in the brains of patients with RRMS. Furthermore, we aimed to determine whether altered expression or function of genes involved in the pathways mediating inflammation might be correlated with altered levels of TNF-α.",57,multiple sclerosis stages phases,-9.73359489440918,32,no_prompt,9,0.15458937198067632,265,0

What are the symptoms of multiple sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis is a condition in which your immune system attacks and destroys nerve cells called myelin, making them sensitive to electrical impulses. Symptoms include: loss of vision; weakness of the muscles that control walking and bladder and bowel function; problems with hearing or balance; and numbness, tingling, pain, or paralysis. These changes may take months or years to appear. Most people who have it don't know they have it because they usually have no symptoms until after their first relapse. You can get multiple sclerosis even if you never have had a flareup before. But sometimes a flareup may occur at a later time during your course of illness.

How is multiple sclerosis treated? Treatment for MS depends on how severe your symptoms are, how long you've been having them, and whether they're caused by a virus or other cause. For milder cases of MS, medications and physical therapy can help speed recovery from your initial attack. A few drugs may also be used to relieve some of your symptoms. If a doctor thinks there's a good chance that you'll develop chronic relapses -- the recurring episodes that often lead to disability -- he or she will prescribe a stronger dose of medication or try another treatment option.",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-7.353719234466553,79,no_prompt,9,0.5939849624060151,228,7

gpt2-xl_72,"The new study by French researchers shows that it may be. They gave a large group of patients with multiple sclerosis, which is an autoimmune disease caused by antibodies that attack the body's own cells and can cause paralysis or even death. One of their goals was to compare the safety of three different vaccines: one that contains no live virus; one that contains an inactive form of the simian virus 40 (SV40) known as poliovirus; and one that has the SV40 in its DNA but not the active part. The results are now available online.

They found that the two types of vaccine had no effect on the long-term health of these patients — they were healthy at the start of the trial and remained so up until 12 years after vaccination. This suggests that the safety of both types of vaccine is similar to what is expected from the existing medical practice. However, the researchers also found that the group who received the Salk polio vaccine did experience reduced rates of autism spectrum disorder compared to those who received the Sabin oral polio vaccine.

To clarify these issues we analyzed the relation between red meat consumption and prostate cancer risk separately for each of the five cohort studies using a random-effects model adjusted for age at baseline. The pooled relative risks (RRs) were 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87 –0.97; P trend = 0.008), 0.85 (95% CI 0.78 –0.92; P trend = 0.001), 0.73 (95% CI 0.67 –0.77; P trend < 0.0001), and 0.83 (95% CI 0.76 –0.90; P trend < 0.0001). A dose-response analysis was also performed by examining associations among men who consumed >1 serving/day compared with less than 1 serving/week or never consumers ( ). There was no statistically significant evidence that increasing levels of total red meat intake were associated with increased risk of prostate cancer when compared with consuming <1 serving/month (P trend = 0.923). When the analyses were restricted to those with follow-up time shorter than 5 years (n=743 cases) there was little difference in the results (data not shown) suggesting that any observed effect is unlikely due to chance alone. Thus, our findings indicate that eating more than 3 servings of processed meats per day is associated with an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer.

The main strength of this review was its prospective design, which enabled us to pool the results of multiple cohorts and thereby obtain reliable estimates of effects across different categories of dietary components. This approach had several limitations however. Firstly, as most of the cohorts included are case–control studies, we cannot rule out residual confounding from other unmeasured factors such as smoking. Furthermore, although some specific types of animal products can be considered carcinogenic (e.g., nitrosamines), the association between meat consumption and risk of prostate cancer remains unclear. Another limitation is that we relied on food frequency questionnaires rather than self-report for information on diet. In addition, because the exposure assessment was cross sectional, it did not allow us to assess heterogeneity between studies or investigate the potential impact of other dietary factors. Finally, although we included a wide range of variables measured at baseline including BMI and history of diabetes, the validity of these covariates has been",116,outcome prostate cancer,-10.714439392089844,162,no_prompt,9,0.6532258064516129,388,7

If you have to take a break from the strength training, take some time at least once or twice every week to stretch out your body as much as possible. You should also include some gentle stretching in your daily life: while walking, standing, sitting, sleeping etc.

This is especially important if you're prone to injury – it's not good for your joints to injure your body any further as that will increase your risk of developing injuries. If you find yourself getting injured often, you may want to consider strengthening those muscles in your arms to prevent them from becoming overstretched and therefore less able to protect your shoulders.

3) Avoid the extremes of training

Cancer can also arise from one's exposure to certain substances. For example, researchers have found that exposure to asbestos was linked with increased rates of bladder cancer. Similarly, smoking tobacco is associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, such as oral cavity and pharyngeal cancer.

It isn't surprising then that some studies have found that those exposed during their teens are more likely to develop respiratory diseases than their peers. A study published earlier this year examined data on about 18,000 U.S. adults between the ages of 21 and 39 years old. Researchers used information collected by the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) between 1986 and 2008 to examine how many were current smokers and had been diagnosed with asthma since age 15. They discovered that among these individuals, younger participants reported having more frequent episodes of bronchitis and wheezing compared to older participants. According to the American Lung Association:

People who started smoking in adolescence were four times more likely to report having asthma during their life time, compared to nonsmokers. People who began smoking before age 19 were almost twice as likely to have asthma than people who didn't smoke until age 25. The researchers believe this pattern could contribute to the fact that young adult lung function is lower than that of adolescents. Older people also seem to be less sensitive to environmental influences than young people. It might therefore make sense to protect children against the potential health risks associated with cigarette smoking and other environmental exposures.

Another study conducted last month looked at nearly 14,000 women of childbearing age across five different countries and found that the rate of early pregnancy loss (which includes miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth or low birth weight) increases dramatically when women reach puberty. Specifically, a 2-fold increase was found among women aged 12–17 years old in Finland, Sweden and Denmark. These findings indicate that a person's risk of experiencing early pregnancy losses increases exponentially during the teen years. Interestingly, this increase wasn't seen among both pre-teens and teens, but only among women. So while being born into the right family environment may protect your reproductive system from early pregnancy loss, it won't prevent you from losing your baby if one does occur.",101,heavy flares swelling lymph nodes,-14.009523391723633,115,no_prompt,9,0.9349593495934959,402,0

Pituitary gland disorders:

Abnormalities in pituitary function are associated with several common diseases, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and an adrenal tumor. Thyrotoxicosis is a rare condition in which the thyroid gland fails to produce enough hormones (hyperthyroidism) or produces too much (hypothyroidism). In these conditions, hormone levels remain abnormally low for a long time and may be permanent. The most common cause of hypothyroidism is Graves' disease (osteosarcoma), but other causes include tumors of the adrenal glands, pituitary adenomas, or congenital defects that disrupt pituitary release. A number of drugs can affect pituitary function. For example, some antidepressants increase levels of free cortisol, which can stimulate the production of thyroid hormones; others inhibit thyroid hormone action by altering how it is metabolized. Patients taking certain blood pressure medications are more likely to have abnormal changes in pituitary function due to their increased risk of cardiovascular problems. Some types of chemotherapy and radiation therapy also interfere with pituitary function.

How to Sleep Better with a Pillow Neck?

As mentioned, one of the most important things when it comes to sleeping is staying healthy and comfortable. Unfortunately, in many cases, people don't have a clue on how to prevent or cure their sleep problems. In this article I'll try to cover some of those common issues you may be facing, as well as provide you with some helpful tips and tricks that will help you improve your sleep experience. This should be something everyone who suffers from any kind of sleep disorder can benefit from.

First, let's take a look at some of the main reasons why people suffer from pillow neck pain:


The primary cause of pillow neck pain is often not related to sleep itself, but rather with some other underlying issue. One such condition could be an inflammatory problem caused by stress, which is known as ""rhabdomyolysis"". Another reason for pillows being so uncomfortable might be the fact that they're too long for one person. This is very common among men, since they tend to carry more weight than women do. The solution to both problems would be to shorten your pillow length if possible.

Another thing to consider is whether you prefer a short pillow, or a tall pillow. A shorter pillow might feel more natural during sleep. Also, if you feel like you need to close your eyes a lot during the night, then you want to make sure the height isn't too high. A tall pillow might not be right for everyone though. Some people just find them uncomfortable and might not use them anyway.

Now let's move onto what pillow neck treatment can do:


There are quite a few different types of pillow neck treatments out there. These include:

Massage. Massages are a great way to relax the muscles around your head and neck without hurting yourself (or causing any other problems). A massage will also reduce the pressure from your face upon the pillow. It works wonders!


Soft tissue mobilization/massage. Similar to massaging, soft tissue mobilizations will relieve muscle tension around your pillow. However, instead of using hot water or oil, these treatments use gentle heat and friction. You can either apply heat directly to the skin or simply rub the area between two fingers. Don't worry about burning your hands if this method doesn't work for you!


Heat packs. Just like above, heat packs give us relief by helping to release tension on our necks and shoulders while also reducing pain. They'll",119,best pillow neck pain,-0.0236385725438594,28,no_prompt,9,0.16568047337278108,422,14

What are the possible side effects of Metoprolol tablets?

The most common side effects associated with Metoprolol tablets include:

Decreased appetite (especially in children).


Nausea and vomiting.


Weight gain (particularly in children)

Other side effects include:

Heartburn

Headache

Abdominal cramps

Aches and pains (including muscle pain), especially after exercise

Pale skin, hair loss, skin irritation

Vomiting or diarrhea

If a child has an allergic reaction to the drug, he/she may need extra treatment. For example, if an allergic reaction occurs within 24 hours of starting the medicine, an injection will be given and then Metoprolol tablets may continue for 2 more weeks. Your health care provider may also recommend that you take another antihistamine or allergy medication to help treat your symptoms. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you experience severe dizziness or lightheadedness while using Metoprolol tablets. The dizziness should go away quickly but it can last up to 1 hour. It is important that you rest as much as possible while taking this medicine. A person who experiences any adverse reactions should stop taking the medication immediately and contact their health care provider.

What happens if I miss a dose of Metoprolol tablet?

Missing a dose of Metoprolol tablet does not affect how long you must wait between doses. However, if you miss one dose, take it at least 2 days later.

What happens if I overdose on Metoprolol tablets?

Seek emergency medical attention or call Poison Help right away if you think you have taken too many Metoprolol tablets. An overdose of Metoprolol can be fatal.

What should I avoid when using Metoprolol tablets?

Avoid drinking alcohol.

Metoprolol tablets should not be used with other medicines that contain acetaminophen, including Tylenol®, Percocet® and others.

If there is an obvious cause (like muscle spasms), the doctor can make that known and the patient may or may not be able to go home with his/her medication. But if there isn't any reason to suspect MS, the disease must be found before taking away one's life-saving medications. Sometimes even if they are doing well on their drugs, patients are not cured. They have relapses. That means the disease has returned in full force. This is called secondary progressive MS and can occur after just one month on the drug. That is why we often see these patients at our clinic. I think some people assume that when someone gets multiple sclerosis and is off of their current meds that it is gone forever. In fact, doctors don't know how long they can keep people on their meds without symptoms returning. It really depends on what the disease is. But let me tell you this – once this disease returns, it's permanent.

Interviewer: And how does MS progress from one relapse to another?

Dr. David: With each relapse, the immune system attacks parts of the brain, spinal cord, and body. These areas become inflamed, scarred, infected and damaged which then leads to more inflammation, pain, memory loss, weakness, numbness, seizures, vision problems, etc… As MS progresses, the body begins to lose its ability to repair itself and to heal itself. This is where the physical effects of multiple sclerosis begin to take place such as osteoarthritis, nerve damage, depression, anxiety, headaches, sleep problems, gastrointestinal issues, bone fractures, and joint problems like hip fracture, shoulder dislocation, knee injury, etc... There is no cure for MS but we do believe that by controlling inflammation and other environmental factors we can slow down the progression of this disease and possibly stop it altogether.

As you can imagine, I was devastated when Dr. Sussman called me and informed me that I had a double mastectomy, which meant they would be removing my breasts altogether. This was devastating news and made me feel very vulnerable for being so young, because we were still in the process of finding out if the surgery would work and, even then, not knowing what would happen to us. My mother, who has seen me through this entire ordeal has been amazing in her support and understanding during this difficult time. The last few weeks have been extremely emotional for us as we both prepare ourselves for the next step. As you are aware from our previous blog posts on this topic, the procedure will likely take over two months, with several rounds of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. We all know how important family is to a person's health and well-being, so it has been really important for us to make sure that there is someone who is emotionally prepared for this process, whether that be an aunt or friend or any other sort of caregiver. It has always been part of our plan to stay together while Dr. Sussman takes care of the boys and I get the chance to recover. Our goal now is to find a way to keep each other strong until then!


I do want to point out that having my sons involved in this experience has also brought about some incredible growth within myself, where I am more concerned with what needs to be done now rather than the future.

gpt2-xl_77,"Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the nervous system. In MS, a person's own immune cells attack and destroy myelin sheath (the fatty coating on nerve fibers) in order to get into their brain and spinal cord so they can communicate with other parts of the body. The presence of this myelin sheath around nerves makes it difficult for them to be electrically stimulated, even though the nerves are not damaged or dying. This leads to weakness in the limbs and general disability, as well as vision problems. These symptoms occur because the body doesn't produce enough myelin to repair damage caused by these attacks. Myelin-producing tissue may also start losing its ability to repair itself over time. As people age, this loss of myelin becomes more severe, causing greater damage to those who have it. If you have multiple sclerosis, your doctor will likely prescribe medications called immunosuppressants to reduce the damage from the autoimmune response to the myelin sheaths. If your doctor does not know whether your MS has progressed to include progressive myelination or if there are no signs or symptoms of myelinated demyelinating disorders, then she will probably recommend stopping any medication used to treat your MS once you reach a point where the myelin appears to be healed. However, sometimes myelin may still be damaged by the autoimmune process long after your MS has been stopped.

Myelin is also lost through a process known as demyelination; that is, nerve cell death due to abnormal inflammation and subsequent cell death within the nerve fiber. When myelin dies, the nerve cell loses its ability to transmit electrical signals. Even if you stop taking certain medications that suppress the inflammatory responses associated with demyelination, some of your nerves may continue to die. Therefore, while stopping all anti-inflammatory drugs in order to reverse multiple sclerosis may help prevent further progression toward neurodegeneration, it does not necessarily mean that the progress of MS will slow down significantly.",77,How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?,-8.217192649841309,114,no_prompt,10,0.47107438016528924,329,22

Here's how I'm dealing with it:

I've learned that when I use my hands at work or outside in the cold or rain, they start turning into rubber bands (or ""pads"" if you prefer). My fingertips get numb immediately, even before any swelling occurs. If I touch something too hard, my fingertips go limp and lose all sensation. When this happens, I just turn my left hand over on its side and let the pads under my index finger slide up onto the top of my palm for support while keeping pressure on my injured thumb. For some reason, when I'm using my right hand, my fingers don't feel so sore until after two hours have passed.

After reading many articles about wrist injuries, I realized that there's no magic bullet to curing these issues. There are some things you can try to minimize symptoms such as excessive sweating (which may be caused by your body trying to keep your sweat-drenched clothes dry), excess motion, or too much gripping force. But you still need to take care of the underlying problems. And luckily, there is hope!

Avoid sandals because sandals tend to give your skin irritation. Some people wear high heels to increase their comfort level, but I find them uncomfortable and distracting.

As time passed, I began experiencing numbness and tingling sensations in one arm and other parts of my body, along with occasional lightheadedness.

It took me a few weeks of emailing my doctor asking for help, and getting no reply before I decided it was time to get the word out about this amazing condition. My first email went unanswered and I sent another one in the hopes someone would answer. That also went unanswered. One day I received an email from a woman named Rachel. She'd read my blog and emailed saying she could relate to my situation. We ended up talking on the phone for two hours. Her story made me feel so much better. After all these years of being in the closet because of my skin, I finally felt like I could finally be who I really am.

Rachel's Story:

I have Eczema. It started off as itchy red bumps on my legs. As they grew, I noticed I couldn't sleep at night without having something rub against my face. At first I thought nothing of it (like most people do). Then one day I woke up with a bunch of tiny little blisters under my arms. They were small, but when I moved them a couple inches, I could tell there were pus inside. These blisters would last only a few minutes. But then I began noticing the rest of my body. Every time I brushed my teeth or took a shower, my arms would burn. When I cleaned myself with soap and water I'd hear a popping sound every time I pushed against the barber pole brush. No matter where I went, the burning would occur somewhere along my body. Over the next several months I developed lesions everywhere from my ears to the back of my neck, all the way down to my toes. In addition to scratching myself, I would scratch others. For example, on my wrists, legs, elbows, shoulders, knees and feet I even scratched other girls. And my parents started to notice too. While sitting on the couch, I often caught their attention and looked over my shoulder. Since I was always hiding behind the covers, they didn't realize until they saw that my arms and hands had a huge rash covered with thick black spots. Eventually, I was diagnosed with psoriasis.

If you feel that way then the only advice we can give you is not to worry too much. The fact of the matter is there are many people who know how to do exactly what you're doing and get on with their lives without ever having been affected by this illness.

You don't need to live your whole professional life in fear of being struck down by MS. There is a lot more than just that, but we'll save that for another day when I write something else. What you should focus on is getting better and finding out as much information as possible so that you don't make any mistakes that might lead to serious problems in your own life.

My doctor believes there are some things that could be done to help me get better faster. He has told me he would like to put together an article that explains his thinking and gives me my options before I decide which one to take. This will include discussing the potential risks of each one along with whether or not they are worth considering. My question is: Which option should I choose? It seems obvious to me that the drug cocktail recommended by him (which includes two drugs used off-label against epilepsy) is far safer than using natural treatments, such as diet, exercise, supplements and rest; however, I'm still concerned about the side effects. Is this true? What is the risk/reward ratio?

There is no real ""risk/reward"" balance here. You really don't want to have anything other than natural treatment options available at all times. We cannot be certain what natural treatments are actually effective until we try them ourselves. That said, we know that it is easier to use a pill or injection rather than trying some alternative approach, especially if the person hasn't had experience with these methods already. However, if the physician recommends a medication with significant side effects (such as high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke) then you probably ought to consider that option first – even though it isn't guaranteed that it will work well enough to prevent symptoms from returning (but it may). Your health care provider is also likely to offer you lifestyle changes that aren't directly related to your disease, such as exercise or eating a healthy diet. They might encourage you to try these, but do you want to go along with that? Of course not!

The study, led by Dr. James J. Daley of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, found that people with MS who consumed more than two glasses of milk or yogurt daily had a 30% lower risk of developing MS. They were also nearly 40% less likely to have symptoms of the disease. The researchers also found that when they controlled for diet and other lifestyle factors, those who consumed milk products were 25% less likely to develop a new case of MS in the next three years compared to people who did not consume these foods regularly.

""It's really exciting,"" says Daley. ""A lot of people think about dairy as something associated with obesity and diabetes. That's certainly true of some, but we wanted to look at how milk may reduce risk of developing MS.""

In the past 20 years, there has been much focus on the role dietary factors play in MS development. However, there hasn't been any solid evidence until now showing the relationship between milk consumption and the autoimmune disease, according to Daley.

""We are getting a good deal of evidence that one of the major things driving the incidence of MS is inflammation,"" he says. ""Inflammation was thought to be caused by viruses, like measles or chickenpox; however, it turns out that a number of different substances can drive inflammation, including inflammatory cytokines and even dietary proteins like dairy products and fish oils.""

Daley teamed up with the Johns Hopkins Medicine team on the study. In particular, they focused their attention on several immune cell populations called T cells and B cells, which play important roles in both clearing harmful bacteria from the gut, which leads to diarrhea, and protecting against infections such as influenza. The team used genetic markers to determine whether the presence of these cells could explain why people with MS often experience frequent bouts of fever.

They then examined blood samples collected from the participants to see if the types of cells circulating in the bloodstream showed signs of inflammation. They looked specifically at B cells known as cytotoxic lymphocytes, which make antibodies capable of killing invading pathogens. CTLs are often elevated in patients with MS, and therefore might cause inflammation, Daley explains.

When they analyzed these data using a statistical model similar to what's used to analyze cancer data, they found that people who drank more than two glasses of milk each day -- about 10 ounces of cheese and a half gallon of low-fat milk -- had about a 30% decreased chance of developing MS over",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-3.578434467315674,21,no_prompt,10,0.10294117647058823,428,0
gpt2-xl_54,"Multiple sclerosis is a brain and spinal cord disorder that affects approximately 1 in 100 people. The symptoms usually begin suddenly, or at some point after an injury. They are often more severe than the typical type of MS called relapsing-remitting (RRMS), which occurs gradually over many months. RRMS typically starts with muscle weakness, numbness, tingling or pain in one area of your body. Over time, you may experience loss of motor function such as walking, talking, swallowing and bladder control. Eventually, the disease progresses to affect other parts of your nervous system (neurological disorders) such as vision, hearing, balance and bladder control. If left untreated, it can cause progressive nerve damage and permanent disability.

You don't need a doctor's test for multiple sclerosis because your doctor will be able to tell what type of MS is affecting you based on your symptoms. Doctors also use the signs and symptoms of MS to predict the likelihood that someone with your condition has other serious health problems. However, if you have one or more of these conditions: epilepsy; a heart problem, heart attack, stroke or blood clotting disorder; cancer; infection; viral illness; diabetes; neurological surgery; kidney dialysis or liver transplantation; HIV/AIDS; immune system disease (such as leukemia); arthritis; depression; or chronic fatigue syndrome, then a medical evaluation by a specialist will be needed. Also, if you haven't been diagnosed yet, please contact your local Multiple Sclerosis Society or another organization that works with individuals with MS to find out about organizations available for support.

What are the different types of MS?

There are three major types of MS: relapsing-remitting (RRMS), primary progressive (PPMS) and secondary progressive (SPMS). Relapsing-remitting MS is the most common form of MS and the least disabling. People with this type of MS recover from their symptoms over several years.

Primary progressive MS typically develops gradually over five to ten years before progressing into more severe forms. It is considered a terminal form of MS.

Secondary progressive MS begins when an initial symptom worsens, such as feeling tired and weak, before progressing to loss of movement, speech, and quality of life. This type of MS is less painful but may cause lasting physical and cognitive difficulties.

For example, someone who has an anxiety disorder is likely to have a longer and more severe course of illness than someone with depression.

It can occur without a clear explanation and involves some of the same signs and symptoms of schizophrenia but usually lasts only for a few hours.24 A psychiatric emergency refers to the sudden onset of psychosis symptoms while you're still awake. Someone with schizophrenia can also experience these symptoms when they're not under the care of a healthcare provider.25 There are a number of different types of psychiatric emergencies, including panic attacks, delusions, hallucinating, delirium, hallucinations and delusions after a previous seizure or other injury.

Instead, researchers from the University of California at San Francisco surveyed 30 individuals in this age group who were using psychedelics for spiritual and religious purposes. They asked them about their experiences with those drugs—how often they used each one, how long it lasted, whether they had any negative side effects, and so forth. The data showed that only a quarter of participants reported having experienced significant ""psychedelic effects"" such as altered states of consciousness (such as seeing things other people couldn't), mystical or out-of-body experiences, or feelings of unity with others, while nearly half said they hadn't. Only 10 percent had experienced any negative psychological outcomes related to these substances (which can include delusions, paranoia, and panic). A majority of respondents also endorsed that they felt positive afterward (for example, feeling less judgmental or anxious after an experience) and expressed little desire to use the drugs again, even if they'd enjoyed them during their first experience. [5 Myths About Pot]

The findings could point to two possible explanations: One is that psychedelics don't cause lasting changes in behavior. That's because few studies have directly assessed the effects of psychedelic use over time; they mostly focus on short-term effects, which is why many people are skeptical that they'll ever achieve the same kind of enlightenment they once experienced, says study co-author Roland R. Griffiths, PhD, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at UCSF.

Another possibility, however, is that people who've used psychedelics report having a profound effect upon themselves and others, particularly when they're experiencing difficult life situations like divorce or illness, Griffiths told Live Science. This may make it more likely that they will respond positively to future psychedelic use. For example, if someone has learned how to cope successfully with a stressful situation, he or she might be inclined to try a similar approach again, according to research published in May 2013 in Psychological Science.

In this case, Griffiths believes his team may have found some clues to both hypotheses. After all, the results suggest that psychedelic users tend to feel good after they've taken them. So does this mean that the mind-expanding effects of LSD can actually help alleviate mental health problems? Not necessarily, Griffiths cautions.

In people who are not taking thyroid medications, there may also be another option to consider — a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).

""The biggest issue is a lack of awareness,"" said Dr Yvonne Brown-Smith, senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Reading and lead author on the study. ""We are seeing more people coming to university for training that isn't necessary.""


Researchers have warned that too much time spent using devices outside the classroom may limit students' performance and make them less well prepared when they finally get into university.

Students who used a smartphone or laptop in class had significantly worse results than those who did not, according to the research published online in Springer's journal Computers in Human Behavior.

Participants were asked questions about their device usage while taking tests measuring attention, memory and reaction times. They also completed questionnaires about their attitudes towards computers, which researchers found showed signs of being negatively affected by technology.

""Our findings indicate that exposure to technological distraction has an impact on cognitive performance, but only if it occurs early enough,"" said Smith. ""If students spend more hours each week playing with phones or tablets than reading books, then our study suggests that this will influence learning outcomes. This could be particularly important for younger learners – there is growing evidence from other countries that exposure to technology before age 18 can affect educational achievement later in life"".

Previous research has shown that students exposed to screens during lectures suffer academic performance problems because their brains don't receive enough rest and sleep. However, the current study was the first to show that excessive screen time also affects pupils' ability to concentrate, with some effects seen even after just one year of studying.

More than half of all young people now use smartphones or tablets in classes, according to survey data by the Education Datalab market research agency earlier this month. Students are also spending longer periods glued to their phones while waiting in queues and making purchases, rather than working.

However, experts warn that excessive digital use doesn't necessarily mean poor test-taking skills. The most common reason given for switching off is boredom; however, some find it difficult to focus at work, particularly if they're constantly checking social media sites. Other reasons include anxiety over privacy issues and fears of wasting valuable classroom time.

In addition, recent evidence suggests that type 2 diabetes can predispose individuals to developing multiple sclerosis (MS) [24] as well as cardiovascular disease [25], although this link remains controversial.

One of the major aims of our study was to address the issue of whether dietary patterns differ between those who develop MS and those with other autoimmune diseases. We hypothesized that people with MS would have lower intakes of protein-rich foods such as red meat, fish, dairy products, eggs, poultry, legumes, nuts and seeds than their healthy counterparts. This hypothesis was based on the observation that these groups were not only at increased risk for MS but also had an elevated prevalence of obesity and associated metabolic disorders [26]. Furthermore, we examined associations between different types of dietary patterns and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in both conditions.

It is known that the immune system has a role in maintaining homeostasis within the central nervous system (CNS) by detecting foreign substances entering into the CNS from other organs or tissues, and removing these through phagocytosis. The current study also suggests that the brain's own defense mechanisms may be an important factor in MS pathogenesis, particularly because it was shown that CD14+CD16+ T cells were significantly reduced in the brains of patients with remitting MS compared to healthy controls. These results are consistent with our previous work showing that CD14-positive circulating T cells were reduced in those who experienced relapse in the early phase of the disease after first onset, suggesting that this reduction was due to the loss of these cells by inflammation. Finally, we observed decreased numbers of activated B cells in the thalamus and hippocampus in patients with secondary progressive MS, which was consistent with other studies demonstrating altered levels of activation of Th1/Th2 ratio in the blood of these individuals. Taken together, these data suggest a possible correlation between impaired immune responses and reduced clearance of intracellular pathogens throughout the CNS and point towards novel therapeutic approaches for preventing autoimmune diseases associated with a high degree of interplay among the various immune systems within the body.",57,multiple sclerosis stages phases,-10.725513458251951,58,no_prompt,10,0.28019323671497587,222,0

The research team, led by Professor Charles Spence from the University of Adelaide's School of Medicine and Dentistry and Dr Jonathan Dantas-Vidal from the Hospital for Sick Children, looked at genetic abnormalities in the MS brain cells. The researchers found that mutations were present in about half of all MS patients - which is similar to what was seen in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's.

""We identified one gene mutation causing this type of multiple sclerosis - it affected a protein called PTEN,"" says Professor Spence. ""This particular mutation causes a reduction in expression of an enzyme important for cell growth."" This enzyme helps to turn proteins into molecules that can be used by cells like nerve cells.

Professor Spence believes that the discovery has significant implications for treating MS patients because it may open up new avenues of treatment. He said this could mean the first drug derived from stem cells could be available within five years.


""Patients with this very rare form of MS have no hope of developing a cure or improved quality of life, but we've demonstrated that there are potentially therapies out there that target this specific protein.""

""At the moment you only get these drugs if they are approved for use in the US, so a lot depends on how quickly they come through our approval process and whether or not there is enough safety data in clinical trials to back them up.""

The study also provides clues to why MS develops. Researchers believe that changes in the way the body responds to drugs in MS and other degenerative conditions occur when the immune system becomes overactive and attacks healthy tissues.

gpt2-xl_72,"The vaccine was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in April 2012, and will be available on the NHS from mid-August. So far, about two per cent of those who have received it are reported to have developed the rare but serious muscle weakness known as Guillain-Barré syndrome. This is a condition that causes temporary paralysis, usually affecting one arm or leg. However, some people may develop permanent damage – such as blindness, deafness or stroke – if their immune system attacks nerve cells. It can take several months before symptoms begin. Symptoms include sudden weakness in either legs or arms, fatigue, severe headache, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. The onset occurs within hours of vaccination, with up to six days between the time of vaccination and the first symptoms appearing. These symptoms often occur at the same time as they do after any other immunisation. They can last for weeks or even months. A person's likelihood of developing Guillain-Barré syndrome depends on how long he has been vaccinated. For example, if someone had two doses of the vaccine shortly before or after going on sick leave, his chances would be reduced. If an individual has never been vaccinated against polio, there is no increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome; however, if the person has not been vaccinated for more than five years, then the risk is higher than usual. People should wait eight weeks after being given the booster dose before returning to work or school – even if the virus hasn't been circulating around them yet. A doctor is normally consulted immediately if you experience any unusual symptoms during this period.

What happens next?

It is still too early to tell whether the case of the 10 patients is linked to the vaccine, but we now know that the disease seems unrelated to any previous event in these patients. We believe that the Guillain-Barré syndrome is most likely to result from the body's response to the injection of live virus rather than its natural host. If this proves correct, the results could help us understand why Guillain-Barré syndrome is so uncommon among those vaccinated. In addition, our findings might also provide clues to new treatments for diseases like Guillain-Barré syndrome.

In summary:

If the 10 patients were indeed suffering from Guillain-Barré syndrome caused by the live Vibrio cholerae bacteria, a change in our understanding of the disease might lead to better treatment options for",72,Is the Covid-19 vaccine safe for people taking multiple sclerosis drugs?,-12.268056869506836,196,no_prompt,10,0.92018779342723,405,41
gpt2-xl_79,"The most common type of genetic disease is multiple system atrophy (MS). When one of the body's many systems becomes damaged, such as when a person with MS develops an infection or a tumor, it can result in progressive loss of function. There are three types of MS that have different symptoms: optic neuritis, demyelinating polyneuropathy, and myasthenia gravis. If you have any of these types of MS, your doctor may suggest testing for another gene mutation. This would be a good idea if you also have:

If your doctor suspects you might carry two or more genes that cause MS, they will test you for each gene. They may do this by performing blood tests using the following methods:

Routine blood tests to detect antibodies to proteins called antigens in people who develop multiple sclerosis. These antibodies help tell doctors whether someone has MS or not. Antibodies are made from the same parts of the immune system that attack the virus or bacteria that causes a rash. A person does not need to take antibiotics to prevent infectious diseases until after he or she starts taking medications to treat their MS. However, antibiotics usually stop the production of antibodies.

A review published in the journal of the American Society for Nutrition found that the risk of dying from any cause is 1.6 times higher among men who eat two or more servings per day of meat, poultry and fish than those who consume less than one serving daily.

The researchers used data on 35,000 U.S. adults aged 25 to 64 years from the National Health Interview Survey and pooled them with information from other studies on male reproductive health and eating patterns. They concluded there was a strong association between these habits and an increased risk of death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) over all ages up to age 74 years. In addition, mortality rates were 20% higher among low-meat dieters compared with non-dieters.

""It's important to be aware of this because the dietary guidelines recommend reducing red meat consumption,"" said study author Dr. Anthony Bogaert, a cardiology fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""If you do not have heart disease already, then I think it's worth trying to reduce your intake. But if you are already sick or have heart disease, it would probably make sense to limit the amount of meat you eat.""

Dr. Bogaert noted that the link does not apply to all diets -- only those high in meat, poultry and seafood. He noted that some people may find their health improves when they cut back on animal products but others will still experience negative effects.

RESULTS:

The number of patients who experienced a favorable response to pemetrexed was approximately twice as high in the first year after the event (20% vs 8%) than in the second and third years, but these numbers remained relatively stable during subsequent years. After 2 years, the proportion of patients who had an unfavorable response to the treatment was about equal for all study arms; however, the difference was greater after 3 years. The median survival time at 1 year in the pemetrexed arm was 11 months, compared with 13 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.65 [95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.97]; P =.001). In multivariate analysis, smoking status and use of oral contraceptives were independently associated with poor outcome (P <.05 for each). At 6 months posttreatment, there was no significant difference between groups in the proportion of patients who died from other causes.

The effects on a person's life are devastating: for some it leads to death from complications of MS itself, while others lose their ability to work or study because they cannot tolerate their joints. The illness also has a significant impact on families, with one survey finding that about half of people who have lived with MS have died.

""It is time for us all to take stock of this disease,"" said John Ioannidis, the Stanford professor of medicine whose 2006 paper ""Bad Science"", which suggested that studies published by leading medical journals were often wrong, led to the widespread recognition that much research was flawed.

""We must come together as scientists to better understand the consequences of what we do, to avoid making mistakes. We need a new approach based on a belief system.""

At times Ioannidis – who has become an outspoken critic of scientific evidence-based policy – has been accused of peddling conspiracy theories, but he believes that his criticism should be given equal weight. He cites two examples of research that were later discredited that had found links between smoking and lung cancer and HIV/Aids.


He criticised papers suggesting that cigarette smoke caused cancer when his own team discovered that a large number of smokers did not suffer any serious health problems after quitting. Another paper showed that the use of alcohol increased the risk of prostate cancer.

In 2014, Ioannidis launched a campaign called Evidence Based Medicine, calling for more emphasis on peer review and the importance of statistical analysis. It prompted a furious response from groups including the British Medical Association, the Faculty of Public Health, the Academy of Medical Sciences, and the UK Medical Research Council (MRC). They argued that Ioannidis was trying to persuade readers that science was being undermined by ideologically driven researchers and advocates.

But Ioannidis argues that the evidence base needs strengthening, and he points out that many of his critics have been using his arguments to argue against evidence-based policies.

In January, the MRC released an independent report showing how ""the current consensus within the medical community remains robust"".

""I have seen people who are very unhealthy,"" says Dr. Rauch of the University of Miami School of Medicine in Florida, who was not involved with the new study. ""And I've been told by doctors that they're not eating enough fruit."" So, it's possible to eat a healthy diet without necessarily consuming more fruits and vegetables than one would otherwise expect.

But while it may seem like a good idea to make an effort to consume more fruits and vegetables—which can be found at local markets, farmers' markets, or even your own backyard garden—there is no evidence to suggest you'll actually see improvements in health if you do so. This isn't just because we don't have hard data showing that eating more fruits and vegetables improves your overall health; it's also because of how the information on which these recommendations are based is collected.

There simply aren't many long-term studies where researchers ask people to stay at their current levels of fruit intake for the length of time necessary to achieve health benefits. ""In general, when we talk about dietary guidelines there doesn't appear to be an adequate amount of research to show whether those changes translate into better outcomes,"" Rauch tells us. If there were, he argues, we might all buy into them.

That's exactly what researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health hope will change now that they've conducted the first randomized controlled trial examining this issue. They recruited 4,000 adults between 18 and 65 years old to participate in three different tests over nine months. During each test participants consumed either 500 milligrams of beta carotene per day (one serving of carrots), 2,500 milligrams of vitamin C, or nothing at all. Then, two months later they ate a diet consisting mostly of carbohydrates and low amounts of meat, fish, poultry, eggs, nuts, or legumes. Those participants followed a similar pattern to the subjects who had participated in the earlier tests but still increased their consumption of fruit and veggies.

The results? The only group that saw significant increases in cardiovascular risk factors ended up dropping out of the study early. The other groups showed almost no effect. But then again, it's likely that all four groups received similar treatment and were therefore exposed to similar conditions. It's unclear why this happened, though. There could be several reasons for this: First, perhaps the participants who increased their fruit consumption did so due to stress, fatigue, or anxiety rather than as part",96,most efficient and sustainable diets,-12.705950736999512,54,no_prompt,10,0.6,417,7

In these cases, the doctor will give patients a shot of insulin and keep them on it for several days (sometimes even longer). This is an effective way to treat diabetic ketoacidosis but there are some potential side effects. The main one is that some people may need to take additional insulin shots after treatment. It should also be noted that the number of doses per day that you take your injection of insulin depends on how well the pancreas responds. Some doctors recommend taking injections every six hours while others suggest injecting two times per day. Most people find they don't feel better if they skip their daily dose of insulin so this may not be a problem for most people.


What's the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes? What causes it?

Type 1 diabetes develops when the body has too much insulin. When blood sugar levels go up, the cells in your pancreas begin producing more and more insulin, eventually causing the body to burn through its supply of insulin. Eventually, this leads to high blood sugar and can lead to serious complications like blindness or amputation. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body does not produce enough insulin. Instead, the body breaks down glucose from foods into energy-rich fat molecules, which it stores as muscle tissue. This causes the body to use energy to build new muscles instead of storing extra calories as fat.

The best way to prevent type 1 and type 2 diabetes is to eat healthy meals that include lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein such as fish and chicken. You also need to make sure you get adequate amounts of exercise each day and don't smoke or drink alcohol excessively.

Diabetes-related symptoms include:

Shortness of breath

Fatigue

Mood swings

Muscle weakness

Changes in vision

Aging skin

Insulin dependent diabetes

Insulin resistant diabetes

Non-insulin dependent diabetes

3 – The Pillow Neck Exercise:

When I'm having a bad night, I don't do anything. Not even lie down. And yet the next morning, my head is feeling heavy, like a balloon filled with air has been pushed into it. So this exercise is for me. When you first start doing it, just lay on your back with your legs straight in front of you. Do nothing but keep your eyes closed. Just try not to move any part of your body or let yourself get too tired. Once you're comfortable enough, go ahead and raise up off your chest so that your upper torso is resting on your hands, palms facing forward. Now turn your entire body and gently press against your pillow. It should feel quite uncomfortable at first, but eventually, as you build up endurance over time, you'll find that pressing into your pillow will be almost effortless. This may take some practice, especially if you've never done it before. But once you master it, the results will speak for themselves.

You can get better sleep at bedtime using these simple tips. You have two options when trying to improve your sleep at bedtime – 1) use an alarm clock or 2) use artificial light. We recommend going with option #1! Using an alarm clock can definitely help improve your sleep, but it doesn't give you much control over your sleeping habits (like whether or not you need to wake up earlier). Instead, we suggest using the nightlight bulbs provided by your bedroom lights. They are very effective. Try them out during your off hours and see what works best for you. Artificial lighting isn't always optimal either. While artificial light may seem more convenient than using an alarm clock, it also affects your circadian rhythm — it makes you think it's daytime early in the morning when it actually isn't. Try switching to natural light, such as sunlight, which helps reset your internal clock!

A cohort of women with symptomatic hysterectomy at the time of hysterectomy were prospectively enrolled in a multicenter study comparing oophorectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy as adjuvant therapy for women who did not respond to oophorectomy. The primary outcome was pregnancy after hysterectomy, defined as an attempt to conceive within 3 months postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included endometrial volume reduction and menstrual symptom score.

RESULTS:

The overall incidence rate of failure was 5.6% per cycle among patients treated by bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Postoperative fertility was achieved in 85% of women who underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy versus 44% of those treated by unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy; this difference remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders. Women who underwent unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy had more severe endometriosis symptoms than those treated with unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, but this association was no longer statistically significant when adjusted for FSH levels (P = 0.09). Endometrial volume significantly decreased during follow-up in all groups and no patient discontinued or lost their uterus due to ovarian failure. Mean age of patients receiving bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was 37 years; those receiving unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was younger, mean age 39 years, and undergoing surgery before menopause, mean age 41 years. There was evidence of lower oocyte quality, such that anovulatory cycles occurred less often, and higher rates of recurrent miscarriage occurred with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy compared with unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. In conclusion, both unilateral and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomies resulted in similar improvements in sexual function and oocyte quality, with no indication of improved prognosis following bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

gpt2-xl_109,"The best way to describe EDS is to say it's a combination of dyspepsia, heartburn and acid reflux. The symptoms will vary from person to person but they all have similar characteristics. The most common symptom is flatulence that can come in the form of a burning sensation or as a constant sour smell. Some people also experience constipation, diarrhea, bloating, vomiting, abdominal discomfort and weight loss.

What Causes It?

There are several possible causes for EDS. Although each case may seem different there seems to be a link between the three conditions.

One of the main factors contributing to EDS is the size of your intestines (duodenum) as well as whether you have small intestines or large ones. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth occurs when bacteria in the gut become more abundant than normal. This condition may result in an inflamed colon which can lead to chronic inflammation and chronic health problems including diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Large intestinal bacterial overgrowth is caused by poor digestion resulting in insufficient amount of nutrients reaching the intestines. There are many types of bacterial overgrowth which include:

Staphylococcus aureus

Enterobacteriaceae

Gram-negative rods

Firmicutes

Probiotics

Celiac disease

A number of digestive disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome can contribute to bacterial overgrowth causing bloating and gas. This is another reason why GERD and other GI issues are so important to diagnose before the underlying cause is discovered. Also, some medications like antacids, metronidazole and antibiotics can contribute to EDS.

Another factor contributing to EDS is how much fiber you consume per day. Fiber helps with absorption of vitamins and minerals. People who eat a high fiber diet tend to be less likely to develop EDS. Foods rich in fiber include:

Brown rice

Wheat germ

Spinach

Wild rice

Lentils

In addition, eating a diet low in processed foods can help prevent and treat EDS. These types of diets include:

Low calorie diets – especially restricting sugary drinks and sweets

Exercise

Vitamin supplements

Q: What are symptoms associated with relapsing-remitting MS?\nAnswer: Relapses typically involve worsening of disability in a person's arm or leg, and some people experience both legs become weak or lose their ability to walk. They may also develop vision problems such as double vision, changes in depth perception (such as blurred vision) and headaches. In addition, relapses often result in fatigue and cognitive decline, although these symptoms are usually less severe than those experienced during attacks of MS. People whose treatment response has been disappointing may feel like they might be having another attack.

Q: How does a patient with MS respond to an immune test to see if the body is fighting off an infection?\nAnswer: An autoimmune reaction occurs when certain white blood cells recognize foreign substances - especially proteins from bacteria or viruses - as invaders, making antibodies to them. Antibodies stimulate T cell activity. T cells can destroy the invading substance. The immune system works effectively only if the right mix of T cells and B cells (natural killer cells) identify and kill all the infected cells. Thus, there must be a balance between antibody production and antibody production against pathogens.

A: The effects of MS on the immune system can be slowed by certain medications or treatments that are taken during recovery time. For example, if you have received immunosuppressive therapy (for example, corticosteroids or steroids) while recovering from MS, the amount of cytokines produced may not be as effective in suppressing disease activity. Your immune system may also be slower to respond when it senses a new infection or antigen (foreign material that triggers an immune response). It takes around two years for your body to repair any damage done after the initial attack of a disease. After this, it usually takes about 12 months for the brain and spinal cord to heal completely. During this time period, you cannot do physical activities such as exercise or sport. You may be able to resume physical activity later on, though treatment is still recommended. If you experience fatigue, headaches, nausea, changes in vision, numbness or tingling, weakness, muscle pain, joint stiffness, persistent problems swallowing, or hearing loss due to MS, contact your physician right away.

Q: Does my medication affect the rate at which my body heals from MS?

A: Medications used to treat MS do alter the course of healing. Some medications increase the risk of infection. Other drugs might interfere with how your body uses vitamin D (see Vitamin D section below). These medications also might interact with each other, so it is important to discuss them with your healthcare provider before taking any medicine. In addition, some medicines used to treat MS may cause side effects, including: liver toxicity; diabetes mellitus; dizziness; depression; dry mouth; heart arrhythmia; increased blood pressure and heart rate; nausea; insomnia; constipation; skin rashes; seizures; weight gain; vomiting; diarrhea; and trouble breathing.

gpt2-xl_77,"Multiple sclerosis symptoms that may occur during the late stage of menopause include dizziness, fatigue and pain. However, women who are in early or late stages of their menstrual cycle have no symptoms during this time.

What is the difference between a female and male hormonal imbalance? A woman's menstrual cycles usually follow a pattern of about 14 days of menses followed by 3-5 days of bleeding. In addition, there may be one period of heavy periods followed by several light periods. Menstrual cycle length varies widely among different races, but it averages about 28 days with an average of 26 days of menstruation per year.


How can I detect early onset of menopause? Menopausal symptoms may not appear until one has reached middle age. Symptoms typically start on the day after the end of the last menstrual period (menarche) or shortly thereafter for women whose cycles are regular. Some women may experience symptoms as early as their 40s or 50s, however, most symptoms will become evident within 5 years. At least 80% of patients diagnosed with early onset menopause report having experienced these symptoms before they turned 40. The following signs may indicate early menopause:

Painful breasts

Feeling of heaviness in breast tissue

Weight gain or loss

Irritability

Change in sexual desire or function

Menopausal changes often begin around ages 55 and continue for another 10 years or more. Asymptomatic menopause occurs when the uterus stops producing hormones, which causes the body to enter what is known as a post-menopausal state. Women who are diagnosed with menopausal symptoms should consult a doctor immediately if they notice any of the symptoms listed above.

The main point being, as you can see, to try and encourage more people to read this book. It really is a great resource - very easy to read and understand. I think that this book should be in every school in America because it will help make you aware of what your body is doing to you every single day. The second thing we need to know about our bodies is that they are constantly changing. Our metabolism changes. Some days we feel like nothing is happening. We go to sleep thinking that we'll wake up and everything will just be fine again. And then we realize that we've had too little rest that week or that month, but when we check on ourselves later on, we may find that we're starving, dehydrated, exhausted, or tired. This is normal. We don't need to worry about all of those things though. Our bodies are designed so that they take care of themselves. We get sick when we eat too many calories and we suffer when we exercise too hard. These aren't life threatening situations. They happen to everyone at some time or another. What you have to remember is that there isn't one reason why you got sick and don't need to worry about it. You could have gotten sick for any number of reasons including poor diet, bad water quality, stress, drugs, etc. Don't let anyone tell you that you shouldn't worry about getting sick. There is no reason why you couldn't end up with a cold or bronchitis or pneumonia at anytime you wish. Just because someone else doesn't get sick, or doesn't seem to experience symptoms that you do doesn't mean it's not possible. Remember: the only way to avoid illness is to live healthy lives. That means eating right, exercising, and avoiding smoking. Those are things which you can change on your own. Do something every day that helps you keep active!

I am currently undergoing an intensive treatment for multiple sclerosis at University Hospital in Toronto. My condition has progressed over the last 6 months to the point where my eyesight deteriorates rapidly, my speech becomes slurred (which I didn't realize I had), my body aches, and I feel increasingly tired all day long. As a result, my employer, The Canadian Institute for Health Information, has recently announced that they will no longer provide health insurance coverage for those affected by MS. They also stated that my treatment must take precedence over any other medical care that I receive as an employee. My condition requires daily medication (medication that costs around $3,000 per month) as part of my treatment regimen. The cost of these medications is paid for by MY paycheque which has already been cut down drastically in recent years due to low employment rates among First Nations people. The cost of this medication alone would run up towards $15,000 a year. Because I am unable to pay for this kind of drug, I rely entirely upon my disability payments to fund my treatments.

What is the best form of low carb?

Question: I'm going to start doing my own research on this issue, so that's why I asked you in the first place. What are some good forms of low-carb for people who want to lose weight and improve their health?

Answer: I would say most diets out there at least offer some type of carbohydrate restriction (low carbs or moderate) or protein restriction (high protein). That being said, a low-carb diet does not have to include high protein or high fat because they often do NOT help one lose weight more than other types of diets. However, if you're trying to reduce your insulin level as much as possible without going into diabetic coma then having a significant amount of higher quality fats or carbohydrates may prove beneficial. This is mainly due to insulin signaling not working properly when these nutrients are ingested because of the increased appetite associated with them (more calories consumed than burned), which leads to a drop in blood sugar levels. Therefore, if you eat enough quality proteins and sufficient amounts of healthy fats along with a few cups of vegetables every day, you should see a huge reduction in your blood sugars, decrease in hunger and feel better about yourself overall!

How do I know if I am eating enough fiber?

Question: If I cut out all processed food and have no added sugar, what kind of fiber will I get from foods like oatmeal or quinoa?

Answer: Fiber, which is made up of complex molecules like cellulose and lignin, promotes satiety by slowing down digestion, helping slow down the absorption of glucose and helps stabilize blood sugar levels. So, when you combine fiber with nutritious, filling meals, you'll find that you can enjoy plenty of fullness throughout the day instead of feeling hungry throughout. For example, oats contain 30 grams of dietary fiber per cup and 15 grams of fiber in each 1/4 cup serving – that means that one cup contains 10 percent of your daily recommended intake. Of course, oat bran (powdered oats) has only 0.5 gram of fiber per serving. Quinoa also has 8 grams of fiber per teaspoon.

The two main sources of fiber in our bodies are fruits and vegetables, but both are extremely low in fiber compared to whole grains. The good news is that we don't need any extra fiber to maintain a healthy gut, as long as we're getting the proper nutrition.

Q. my child has eczema, can he take Sertraline?

A. NO! SERTRALINE CAN CAUSE LESION AND REPRODUCTIVE HARM TO CHILDREN (MALE OR FEMALE). There are many other drugs that have been FDA approved to help children with this condition. The risks of SERTRALINE outweigh the benefits for most children. Please see ""Sertraline Side Effects"" on this web page for a complete list of Sertraline side effects and warnings.

Q. I'm taking Sertraline and my child is also getting it. Will they get any reactions from each other?

A. Yes! Sertraline has an effect on some people's nervous system when taken together. If your child takes both Sertraline and one or more antihistamines, it is very important that you discuss their use in detail as Sertraline may interfere with the action of these medications.

Q. My child was prescribed a different type of medication called Demerol (Dramamine) for his ADHD. Do I need to stop taking Sertraline too?

A. Most people who take Sertraline will not experience adverse effects if they stop taking the drug too quickly. However, you should check your pediatrician for information about how long it takes your child to stop taking Sertraline and then make sure you continue to be monitored closely until there is no longer any sign of improvement.

Q. What happens if someone stops using Sertraline suddenly?

A. Sertraline comes in tablet form and is usually taken by mouth with food. Your doctor may give you a prescription for a chewable tablet called Adzenys XR-ODT which is not available over the counter. It has similar properties as Sertraline but does not come in tablet form and must be swallowed whole.

If you lose contact with your child and no longer have access to the tablets, you may wish to start a new treatment regimen using an alternative antipsychotic. When prescribing Adzenys XR-ODT, your pediatrician or pharmacist may suggest you try a lower dose such as 10 mg once daily as opposed to 20 mg twice daily. This may work better for your child and reduce the risk of becoming drowsy or having problems concentrating.

gpt2-xl_94,"The best way to tell if you're getting better is by having your doctor check in regularly. If you still have a lot of symptoms, or if the effects are not as good as they were before your disease was diagnosed, then it's time for you to be evaluated by an MS specialist. If you do get worse after this initial evaluation and treatment, that means that your MS may need more intensive therapy. But in many cases your illness can improve over time without additional medication or surgery.

If You Have Multiple Sclerosis but Can't Get Diagnosed, Is It Too Late?\nThis isn't always true, though. If you've been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and treated aggressively so far, there's no reason why you shouldn't continue to improve. Your doctor may want to give you more information about how long you might need to wait to see a neurologist who specializes in MS. For example, when a person has a first attack of MS, the body usually responds well within two years and may never progress further. This is called a ""relapse"" period, because once the immune system gets into trouble fighting off the virus, the body goes back to normal. In most people who relapse, however, some of those antibodies also build up again at a later date, which makes the disease return even stronger. And the longer the person waits between the attacks of MS, the greater the risk of developing chronic relapsing-remitting MS (CRSM).

What Are the Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis?\nMS symptoms vary widely from patient to patient, depending on their age, whether they've had previous episodes of MS, and what environmental triggers have caused them. Some patients develop symptoms like numbness, tingling, or weakness in one or both arms and legs; others develop problems with vision, hearing, speech, balance, memory, and coordination. Others experience fatigue, dizziness, insomnia, blurred vision, pain, or loss of bowel control. Still other patients suffer joint and muscle pain, mood disorders, headaches, or difficulty swallowing. Many other symptoms may occur as a result of myelin-related disorders, including nerve damage, brain swelling, and neurological complications such as seizures.

Q: What kind of MS treatments do I need?

A: There is no cure for multiple sclerosis (MS). The best way to help people with MS improve their quality of life is through treatment. However, there are many different types of MS treatments that may help control symptoms and slow progression of the disease.

Treatment options include medication, physical therapy, electrotherapy, sensory integration therapies (SITs), cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs), eye movements, spinal cord stimulation, and surgery. Some treatments, such as nerve blocks, can cause side effects, so doctors will give careful consideration before prescribing them to you. Sometimes you will start a new type of treatment after having been on an old one. For example, if you were treated with nerve blocks and then began a new drug that suppresses neuroblasts, you would begin using the new drug while taking the original ones.

Q: How long does it take to get better?

A: Most people experience some improvement in their symptoms within weeks or months after starting a new treatment plan. In more severe cases, people may require longer periods between treatments. Even if you don't feel better right away, you can expect to regain mobility and function eventually.

Q: Should my family members know about my current medical conditions?

A: Your care team will tell everyone involved that you are getting treatment for multiple sclerosis. They should keep in touch with you about changes in your symptoms and progress, even though you might not show any obvious change. Family members also can provide support for you during your rehabilitation, including helping with household tasks such as cooking or cleaning.

Q: What happens next?

A: After you receive your diagnosis, you'll probably get an MRI scan to find out where in your body your disease is affecting. This will allow your doctor to determine whether or not you are at risk for developing MS relapse. If so, your doctor will prescribe medications that may reverse the symptoms. Doctors often use two tests to make these decisions — a skin-prick test to detect areas that are inflamed, and a spinal tap to look for evidence of spinal fluid leaking into",63,Will multiple sclerosis affect my career?,-0.026456493884325,3,question,1,0.012,418,12

Q. What is the most common cause of long-term neurological sequelae following an organ transplant? Answer: autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) or infection caused by a virus, bacterium, parasite, protozoa (such as roundworms), or fungus. These are the two main causes of chronic neuropathies and complications following organ transplants. The incidence rates for rheumatoid arthritis may be 30 to 50 times higher than that for organ transplant recipients; it can result in extensive scarring. For example, in one large study, about 20% of rheumatoid patients developed new manifestations of their disease within 5 years after receiving a kidney from a donor with systemic lupus erythematosus. In contrast, 2% of transplant recipients developed new signs or symptoms related to their transplant within 5 years.[7]

The risk of developing acute renal failure (ARF) is increased in the first year after a transplant and more so after each subsequent transplant. ARFs have been reported in 60%-80% of transplant recipients who develop chronic neurologic complications (i.e., cognitive deficits). Some studies show that ARFs occur at much lower rates among patients who received organ transplants than those who did not receive transplants.[8] It has also been suggested that some of these diseases might become progressive over time, which could make them difficult to control with current antiretroviral treatment strategies.[9]

Treatment options include a number of different drugs used to treat HIV. Among these medications are several approved for use as anti-retrovirals (ARTs)—antiretroviral therapies that suppress the immune system by interfering with viral replication—and others approved only for treating opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis and influenza. As part of ART regimens, patients are given immunosuppressive medication to decrease their CD4+ cell count. This decreases the amount of blood cells available for the body's natural defense against invading pathogens. Antibiotic therapy (often oral) is often added to prevent secondary bacterial infections. Patients typically remain on anti-HIV meds for life if they have no other treatment.

In addition to taking ART drugs, many patients will also receive antiviral medications called protease inhibitors that inhibit HIV's ability to replicate and infect cells. Proteases destroy the HIV genome during normal HIV infection but are necessary for HIV to reproduce once infected. Patients undergoing surgery or cancer chemotherapy must take this medication because its effect does",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-12.377294540405272,138,question,1,0.6764705882352942,376,1
gpt2-xl_54,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord. The main symptoms of MS are muscle weakness, numbness, or tingling in some parts of your body. Your doctor will order tests to check for any physical problems that might be causing your symptoms. This may involve an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), blood test (glucose level testing), skin biopsy, and/or other procedures. While these tests help determine what's going on with your immune system, they don't always tell you exactly why you have those symptoms. Doctors also use a variety of medications to treat the symptoms of MS. They can do so by changing how your immune system works, using drugs such as steroids to shrink the nerve cells in your spinal cord and treating conditions that cause inflammation (such as rheumatoid arthritis).

What is a neuropathic pain condition?

Q: How common is this type of pain? Why should I be concerned about it?

A: Neuropathic pain, sometimes called chronic pain syndrome, describes pain that occurs after surgery. It usually happens within 10 days of the operation but can happen months later.

It affects 1 out of every 5 people who have had nerve damage from nerve-damaging medical treatments, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, endocrine treatment for hormone imbalance, and certain types of surgeries, including knee replacements, hip replacements, lumbar punctures, spinal taps, and carpal tunnel syndrome.

Nerve damage in both sides of the spine causes severe nerve pain, which often goes away during recovery time if treated properly. But over time, the problem may come back. If untreated, nerve damage could lead to permanent numbness, muscle weakness, or paralysis in one side of the body. These conditions are known as peripheral neuropathy.

This list doesn't cover all the possible ways in which nerve damage may affect patients' health. You may want to talk with your healthcare provider about other types of nerve-related pain and about treatment options.

The problem of mental illness and its consequences for individuals, families, communities, and society has been inextricably linked to social inequality, racism, sexism, and colonialism throughout history. In the United States, the largest single source of mental illness is poverty; however, this issue is often conflated with other issues such as substance abuse, homelessness, unemployment, family dysfunction, low educational achievement, and mental disorders. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that approximately 1 in 5 people worldwide suffer from a mental disorder in any given year [1]. Mental illness affects people of all socioeconomic classes, ethnicities, religions, races/ethnicity groups, sexual orientations, ages, genders, etc. Furthermore, there exists some evidence that indicates higher rates of depression among minority populations [2–5]. For instance, an analysis of over 2 million U.S. children who were interviewed at age six revealed that African American children had a rate of 6.7 times greater odds of having depressive symptoms than white children [6]. This finding was corroborated by another study based on national surveys conducted between 1990 and 2000 that found African Americans living in poverty had more depressive symptoms at age twelve than did whites in the same community [7]. However, despite these findings, many researchers maintain that the majority of individuals affected by mental illnesses do not meet criteria for a diagnosis because of lack of adequate diagnostic tools [8–11]. It should be noted, though, that while it is estimated that there are 1 billion individuals worldwide suffering from major depression in any given year [12], this number includes only about 200,000 cases per annum within the United States [13] ( ). Open in a separate window To gain a better understanding of the relationship between social inequalities and mental health outcomes, we examined whether race/ethnicity, education, income level, and marital status modulate lifetime prevalence estimates of major depressive episodes (MDEs). We also sought to determine if differences in the prevalence of MDEs across demographic categories are explained by underlying individual-level characteristics. Finally, we explored how changes in risk factors for mental illnesses may affect overall lifetime prevalence estimates.

What does holistic mean in this context?

Harmony is the balance between two opposing forces.

In other words, there are two sides to every equation. One side works towards healing while the other side seeks to harm. This can be seen in our lives when we work toward balancing something like love with anger, money with anxiety, or life with fear. The more balanced you make these forces to be, the better off you will be. If you have too much of one force, you'll end up with an imbalance.

So how do we reconcile these opposites? It's all about balance. That balance allows us to live a full and meaningful life while also being able to function effectively under stressful conditions. But balance isn't easy to find; it takes practice.

 Borderline personalities can use a variety of manipulative and deceptive behaviors to get their way in relationships. They usually have difficulty regulating emotional expression, especially anger. The person's thoughts are often unreliable and unstable, making it difficult for them to know what they should do in certain situations. Borderlines' self-image often involves intense feelings of guilt or shame that cause an inability to function at work, school, or social settings.

Borderline Personality Disorder Symptoms: How Can I Manage Them?


The most important thing to remember about borderline personality disorder (BPD) is that there is no one ""right"" way to treat a BPD patient; everyone responds differently to treatment. For example, you might find it helpful if someone has been diagnosed with BPD before trying to change their behavior, even when their symptoms appear less severe than yours. It isn't unusual for people to feel guilty, ashamed, and embarrassed about having BPD because these feelings can trigger anxiety and depression. These feelings must be treated just like any other psychological condition. Your goal should always be to reduce stress and increase resilience—not perfectionism and perfectionistic thinking. When treating a BPD patient, it is important to understand their unique challenges so that you can effectively tailor your plan to meet each individual's needs.

While there are many different ways to treat borderline personality disorder, it is important to realize that a number of the treatments that are most commonly used don't help all patients successfully. You can help determine which treatments work best by reading through our article on the most common approaches to treatment and then discussing this information with your doctor. There also are several types of medication that can be used to treat borderline personality disorders including antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and mood stabilizers. We also recommend starting with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can be very effective with BPD patients. It helps patients learn how to manage their emotions while staying focused on improving behaviors. This type of therapy does not involve talking therapies but rather developing strategies to improve a person's ability to adapt to changes that occur in their life. In addition, the treatment typically requires a monthly commitment to attend weekly group sessions for at least eight weeks to help develop skills needed to cope with stressful life events.

Q4: What are the symptoms of relapsing remitting MS? Answer:

Relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) is a chronic progressive disability affecting at least two-thirds of people who have had MS for a long time. RRMS is characterized by recurrent attacks of demyelinating activity. The number of attacks varies from person to person depending on how severe their disease is at the beginning and how well they respond to treatment. These attacks usually last about 1 year. Most people with MS never recover fully after the initial attack but this does not mean they never develop the condition again. Most patients experience some degree of residual neurologic impairment. Some recover completely and some do so only partially. Symptoms vary according to the type of MS. In general, people with acute or later relapse of MS describe similar features as those described in earlier sections. Some symptoms include: pain in joints (particularly knees), headaches, fatigue, stiffness, muscle weakness, memory loss and vision changes. Others report numbness or tingling of feet and hands, problems sleeping, changes in personality, lack of concentration and problems with balance. Other symptoms include sensory disturbances such as hearing loss, smell loss and light sensitivity. Many people also experience cognitive difficulties which lead to decreased productivity and ability to focus.


Q5: How is RRMS diagnosed? Answer:

In order for a diagnosis of relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) to be made, it must first be established that there has been no improvement in the current course of the illness. If relapses continue into late adulthood or past retirement age, then a more advanced form of the disease, called secondary progressive MS (SPMS), may need to be considered. If relapses occur frequently after diagnosis, a less advanced form of the disease, known as primary progressive MS (PPMS), may need to be distinguished. The various forms of MS are grouped together under the rubric ""relapsing-remitting MS"" (RRMS).


To make a correct diagnosis, doctors look at a number of different signs, symptoms, tests and findings. To start with, it helps to know what a relapsing form",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-0.0212616231292486,2,question,1,0.01015228426395939,400,7

How to identify and treat hypothyroidism?

Symptoms of hypothyroidism may not be obvious. The most common symptom is a dull or depressed mood, called hypomania (1). Symptoms are usually mild in severity but can include feelings of irritability, restlessness, insomnia, weight gain, increased energy, muscle aches and pains, hair loss, low blood pressure, heart disease, high cholesterol, anxiety, depression, and more. People with the condition often have difficulty concentrating and memory problems.

Most people who have hypothyroidism do not experience any noticeable changes in their thyroid hormones when they drink coffee or tea. However, some patients develop hyperthyroidism (high thyroid hormone levels) while taking caffeine because of the way the body breaks down caffeine. High-dose caffeine, especially from caffeinated soft drinks, can cause this side effect. It is important for you to know that your doctor will watch for signs and symptoms of abnormal thyroid function before making a diagnosis of hypothyroidism.

Treatment for hypothyroidism

There is no cure for hypothyroidism, so treating it improves the chances of getting better. Doctors recommend that everyone over age 60 get regular checkups and treatment as needed.

A prescription thyroid medication is one option to help relieve symptoms of hypothyroidism. This type of medicine works by helping the body's cells convert thyroid hormone into T3. When this happens properly, healthy thyroid gland cells grow, releasing thyroxine and T4 to keep the body functioning normally.

Doctors also prescribe a combination of three different medications if symptoms persist after taking one thyroid drug alone. These medications work together to improve the effectiveness of each other, lowering the risk of developing serious complications like stroke or bleeding. Most doctors combine these drugs to prevent a person from becoming too sick to work and live independently.

Some doctors choose not to use a single medication, opting instead to treat all signs and symptoms. In cases where there is no response to one of the available medications, doctors might consider switching to an alternative medication or a combination of two or three medications.

Your doctor should advise you which one(s) of these options is best for you based on the symptoms you're experiencing. If you'd like advice about how to find out what you need, call your local doctor (or see our list below).",123,hypothyroidism symptoms,-0.2464863359928131,4,question,1,0.024691358024691357,377,10

In some instances there are no treatments, because there really isn't anything wrong with the body's own immune system at all. In others, however, certain drugs do have an impact on the immune response of the brain (for example, immunosuppressive medicines like corticosteroids). A person who uses these drugs as part of his/her daily routine can develop autoimmune disease. The best way to prevent this from happening is to use the right combination of drugs or to stop using them altogether. If that fails, then a transplant may help. In fact, there is evidence that transplantation might be able to improve symptoms associated with MS in people already taking certain types of anti-rejection medicine.[11] In the event that these therapies fail, surgery is often an option. If that doesn't work either, then life-long immunomodulatory therapy, such as interferon beta-1b, might play a role.

Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis — Overview

How does a doctor treat MS?

Your health care team will begin by determining whether you have a neurological disorder related to your MS. They'll also determine if any physical problems present themselves.

You're likely to get most of your medical care from a neurologist, but he or she will consult specialists in many fields—including neurology, psychiatry, ophthalmology and rheumatology—to decide what kind of treatment is appropriate. Your doctors may order MRI scans or CT scans, blood tests, or other examinations to look for signs of damage to nerve cells in the brain (neurological deficit), optic nerves, arteries, veins and capillaries that supply the brain, spinal cord, limbs, joints, skin, tendons, muscles and bones. These examinations may include X-rays, MRIs or CAT scans.

Depending upon their expertise and experience, the specialists may prescribe medication or non-pharmaceutical approaches such as exercise training, nutrition, vitamin supplements and psychotherapy.

A variety of medications are available to control MS symptoms, including steroids, immunosuppressants (drugs that suppress the immune system), and other drugs called ""biologics.""

Q: What are the treatments for chronic fatigue? Answer: not well understood by researchers at this time. Some studies suggest that exercise might be useful in treating fatigue (a study from 1991 showed improvements after 12 weeks). Other studies have shown no improvement in patients with ME/CFS, but do show improvements in other illnesses such as HIV-infection. Most importantly, research has found that there is very little evidence to support any specific treatment plan or regimen for treating CFS or similar conditions.

Q: Are there drugs on the market for treating ME/CFS? Answer: yes. There have been several small clinical trials looking at the use of some of these medications for treating the condition. Unfortunately, all the trials were either stopped early because of inadequate results or were inconclusive. The most promising one was run by the CDC and reported positive results last year. It seems to work better than standard therapy but more research needs to be done. For now, please see our list below.

Q: Is there anything else I can do if my symptoms are so severe they make it impossible for me to function normally? Answer: Yes. Please talk with your doctor about getting screened for heart disease, diabetes, thyroid problems, etc. These factors may increase your risk for developing a serious illness like cancer, stroke, or premature death.

Please note: If you choose to get tested for cancer, hepatitis B, HIV, or hepatitis C, we recommend that you visit the CDC website listed above to find out more information. We also highly recommend that you get an annual physical exam (which includes a full blood count and lipid panel) before and after changing your medication schedule.

Our Top 5 Tips for Managing Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS):

1 – Get regular exercise. Exercise increases levels of endorphins which reduce pain and muscle stiffness (aka PEA). Endorphin levels go up when someone exercises hard enough (about 10 minutes per day). This helps reduce the intensity needed to cause the same level of pain and discomfort as before. Regular exercise is important even though you've tried different forms of exercise. There's no reason to give up trying, but try something new each week rather than doing nothing at all. In the meantime, try to avoid heavy lifting if possible. Instead, take 30 minute walks every day while wearing a belt.

question: what can i eat to help me lose weight?

answer: i recommend eating less protein (and also less fat). try to stay away from processed foods, sugar-sweetened drinks and highly refined grains. take a multivitamin or drink 2 litres of water per day, try to avoid saturated fats (like beef, butter, etc.) as they raise blood triglyceride levels more than unsaturated fats and increase insulin resistance too. low carb diets are usually a good thing so long as you limit carbohydrates. if you feel hungry after a meal then you're probably still getting too many calories. you'd need to reduce calorie intake by 500 to 1000 cals per day depending on your situation to make things easier. as well as exercising regularly to burn off extra calories, you could look into fasting (only eating during certain hours of the day, e.g. 8am - 9pm) which will help lower blood glucose levels.

question: are there any drugs available to treat type 2 diabetes?

answer: no one knows exactly why some people develop type 2 diabetes while others don't. most likely it has something to do with genetics and environmental factors, including diet and lifestyle choices. there's currently no drug known to work against type 2 diabetes or even prevent it, although the possibility remains that some drugs that might inhibit platelet aggregation will someday prove effective. the first drug approved for treating type 2 diabetes was glipizide, which is a proton pump inhibitor which works by inhibiting an enzyme called PPARγ. PPARγ plays a central role in energy metabolism, so lowering its activity can lead to significant improvements in body weight and blood pressure. another drug (dabrafenib) is used to treat the side effects associated with insulin, such as frequent urination, thirst and constipation. darunavir, which is in development to target TNFα, is thought to have similar effects to insulin itself in reducing inflammation in the",22,my risk for developing type 2 diabetes,-1.4270614385604858,73,question,1,0.292,409,22

There are four main types of MS -


Idiopathic MS is caused by genetic mutations or other environmental factors that are not known to have been associated with other diseases. These diseases can occur at any time during life and often lead to death before age 50. Idiopathic MS cannot be diagnosed because there are no clinical findings to rule out the cause.

These diseases can occur at any time during life and often lead to death before age 50. Idiopathic MS cannot be diagnosed because there are no clinical findings to rule out the cause. Primary Progressive MS is thought to result from both genetic and environmental factors. A person may develop primary progressive MS if they have had a stroke or another traumatic event that damages their blood vessels causing a blockage. The resulting inflammation may then trigger the development of multiple sclerosis. Other possible triggers include infection, drugs taken by mouth or inhaled, exposure to allergens, or other conditions such as autoimmune disease. If left untreated, patients may experience long term complications including diabetes mellitus and heart disease. Patients who have had strokes and/or other trauma may also develop secondary MS after treatment for primary progressive MS.

Q: multiple sclerosis symptoms in children\nAnswer: symptoms are often present in infants as young as 6 months of age; however, some cases may be diagnosed at 18 months or older.

Q: Multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment options\nAnswer: There are two main types of MS drugs called TNF blockers and cyclophosphamide for treating relapses. Both medications work by reducing the immune system's ability to attack damaged cells within the central nervous system.

TNF-blocking agents can reduce inflammation around nerve fibers, while cyclophosphamide blocks a protein called CXCL8 that causes cell death.

However, both TNF-blockers and cyclophosphamide have side effects including nausea and vomiting, fatigue, dry mouth, diarrhea, muscle weakness and weight loss.

A different type of medication known as anti-inflammatory drugs has been used since the 1980s to treat MS symptoms. These drugs reduce damage from inflammatory chemicals in the brain and spinal cord by preventing them from causing an inflammatory response. They also decrease nerve cell production of certain proteins that cause neurological problems, such as pain. However, these medicines only control symptoms, not prevent new disease to develop later.

Most patients who receive immunosuppressant drugs do so because they cannot tolerate other treatments. Some experts believe this treatment approach is too aggressive for many people with MS. Others think there is still plenty of room for improvement. For example, they said it might help if doctors started using more tolerable drug regimens.


How much should I take?\nThe best way to determine how much you need is to see your doctor, especially if you have had any unexplained numbness or tingling since your last MRI scan. If you're taking another medicine, it will affect how much of each medicine to take. Also, talk to your doctor about possible interactions with any other medicine you are taking, particularly ones to which you've been allergic or sensitive.


What kinds of tests will my doctor do?\nDoctors commonly order a series of blood tests before beginning treatment. Some tests show whether you have antibodies against your body's own tissues or the abnormal cells that form MS lesions. Your physician will also monitor how well you respond to a variety of medications. This includes asking questions such as: Do I feel tired all day?

Question: Secondary progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS) Answer: It is a common form of MS that develops in childhood or adolescence. The main symptoms are numbness and tingling on one side of the body and problems with walking.

Question: Spinal cord injury and MS Answer: There are many causes of spinal cord injuries, including accidents and violent trauma. In children, spina bifida, tetraplegia, hemiparesis and congenital adrenal hyperplasia can all lead to MS. Some researchers believe that some types of traumatic brain injury (TBI) may contribute to MS. Other conditions that have been linked to MS include head injury (including drowning), stroke, myelopathy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Question: Sudden onset chronic fatigue syndrome (SOCF) Answer: This is a common condition that affects about 1% of people aged 65 years old and younger. Symptoms can last from a few weeks to several months. People who experience sudden onset chronic fatigue syndrome (SOCF) usually report feeling tired, having trouble sleeping and being constantly fatigued.

Question: Stricturea Answer: According to the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), strictures are small tears in the membrane that covers blood vessels inside the skull. When these tiny holes are filled with fluid or air, they cause pain and sometimes bleeding. A stricture can also allow fluids into a person's brain, causing swelling of the skull or brain.

Question: Stroke Answer: The risk for strokes depends on the type of stroke (for example, hemorrhagic vs non-hemorrhagic), age at the time of an event and whether other significant risk factors exist. Strokes that occur after an underlying heart problem such as coronary artery disease, high cholesterol, diabetes mellitus or angina may be more likely to affect older adults than others, because of the greater likelihood of heart attacks and death. More research is needed to determine if any additional health benefits associated with getting regular exercise could offset the risks of certain kinds of stroke.

Question: Stress Answer: As you age, your immune system becomes less effective against infections. Although this decrease in resistance to infection contributes to aging, it also increases your chances of developing medical conditions such as depression and anxiety.

How many patients with Multiple Sclerosis have sleep disturbances?:

A few studies have reported an association between MS and sleeping disorders. In one study, researchers found that a quarter of persons with MS had insomnia problems. Another study examined 953 individuals with MS at the time of assessment and found that those with poor daytime sleep quality were four times more likely to develop MS. Sleep disturbance has also been associated with depression in both adults and children; in addition, some studies have indicated that chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) may be related to sleep disturbances.[3-6] However, it remains unclear if these associations hold true across the whole population.[7,8]

What is the relationship between MS and sleep-wake cycles?:

MS affects people differently depending on their age at diagnosis and how severe their symptoms become. The number of hours awake during each 24 hour period varies from person to person, ranging from 2 to 10 hours.[9] These different patterns of sleep can contribute to various behavioral and health outcomes such as reduced alertness[10] and increased stress levels.[11] Some evidence suggests that people who experience a longer waking window while living with MS tend to have better overall well being[12]. For example, subjects with a shorter average waking window had higher scores of positive emotions (self-esteem), social integration and life satisfaction, compared to their counterparts with a long wake interval. One potential reason for this could be that it takes longer for people to recover from an imbalance within the circadian rhythm system. People whose melatonin rhythms are disrupted may not properly adjust their sleep/wake cycle after they resume normal activity because their bodies have not yet fully adjusted to the new day's schedule.[13] Therefore, when you're working up a sweat during the day and have a full head of steam going in the evening, your body might not be ready to go back to bed until the sun comes up again. This is why it is recommended that people with MS take extra care around the clock to ensure that their daily schedules are flexible enough to accommodate their circadian rhythm fluctuations.[14]

The bottom line is that there are no definitive answers regarding the causes of MS. As MS progresses over time, your brain may begin producing less effective amounts of melatonin which leads to",93,Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?,-0.0028167595155537,0,question,1,0.0,432,35

Vaccine Administration Instructions

The CVS Cervarix (Covid) 19 vaccine must be administered by a healthcare provider. Your health care provider will insert the needle into each vial and hold it in place until all three vaccines have been given (see below). Before you begin the process, you may want to take a few minutes to review these instructions:

Read through the following instruction sheet that comes with the CVS Cervarix (Covid) 19 vaccine before giving it to yourself or someone else. You can find the CVS Cervarix (Covid) 19 vaccine instruction sheet in the section entitled ""What's In This Booklet"" near the end of this information leaflet. The booklets contain important information about how the vaccine works as well as any side effects you might experience during vaccination. A copy of this booklet is available at your local pharmacy. It also appears on our website at www.cdc.gov/vaccines or by calling 1-800-232-4636.


A patient's healthcare provider will examine you in person if necessary when you receive the vaccine; if there is concern for potential serious adverse reactions from the vaccine, ask your healthcare provider about alternative options.

If you receive more than one dose of the vaccine at one time, give one dose orally and then wait 3 days between doses. If you choose to skip the oral portion of the vaccine, do not give another dose within 14 days after receiving the first dose, but instead, wait 7 days after the second dose. After 7 days, give another single dose of the vaccine (this does not count against your 28 day total) unless your healthcare provider advises you otherwise. If you miss two doses and wish to get three doses of the vaccine, ask your healthcare provider to call 1-855-237-2899 so that they can administer the third dose.

However, if they already know that you have MS and are receiving treatment for it, there will not be an increased risk of your child being affected by MS.\NIn fact, if any one parent or sibling has MS, passing the disease to another will increase the chances that both children will develop MS in their lifetime, which would be dangerous for all concerned.

Q: How do I tell my baby if I plan to have MS later in life?

A: It can take time for your body to develop symptoms of MS. Therefore, it may take many years before you notice signs of MS. Once you realize that you have MS, you can begin identifying its early warning signals and taking steps to protect yourself from becoming disabled. This will help ensure that you don't get caught off guard. For example, you should try to avoid going out during times when your doctor expects severe symptoms. You can also wear light-colored clothing at night (like jeans and tights) and stay home as much as possible between 9 PM and 6 AM because these conditions cause inflammation in the brain. You should also try to avoid eating too much sugar or food high in carbohydrates since this can aggravate symptoms of MS such as numbness or weakness in parts of your body. These things combined with good sleep habits and exercise can help keep your body healthy so that it does not have to fight against MS.

Q: Are there medications that can prevent, stop, or slow progression of MS?

A: The most commonly used drugs for treating MS are interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, glatiramer acetate (Glatiramer), adalimumab, and etanercept (Remicade). Other drugs include mesial temporal lobe degeneration (MTLD) inhibitors like riluzole, tacrolimus, infliximab, temozolomide, verapamil, lopinavir/ritonavir, cobicistat, natalizumab, and teriflunomide. There is no evidence that any drug alone is effective in controlling or preventing progression of MS. Rather, each treatment strategy reduces the likelihood of MS worsening over time.

A: The number one item on my list of concerns when starting as an assistant professor was ""what do I actually teach?"" After doing a bit more research about assistantships (and having some success with them), I decided to find out if there were any resources available for new faculty who wished to apply to be assistant professors. For those interested in applying, here is information about our Assistant Professor Program.

Q7: How much experience do you need before applying to become an Associate Professor at Michigan State University? Answer: At this time, it is not recommended that candidates have more than two years of teaching experience, but as we move forward with hiring decisions, we may consider additional qualifications or training needed by applicants.

""What do you mean I'm not qualified to be an associate professor?!""

I know how hard it can be to start as an assistant professor! Many people are intimidated by the process. That's why I want to help you understand what you're getting into. If you look through our website, you'll see that we have many great articles specifically about becoming an assistant professor. These include links to job postings, videos, syllabi, academic journals, etc. Just look around, and get comfortable! We'll also give you plenty of advice and references so you won't feel discouraged.

If you'd like, you could contact us for further support. Our email address is [email protected]

Q8: Why do you say that it is unlikely that someone who has never taught has a shot at being selected as an assistant professor? Answer: It just simply isn't possible. The selection committee looks at each applicant individually. Therefore, if you are not familiar with our teaching programs, it would be highly unlikely that we would offer you a spot.

Fluid retention (also known as water retention) is the most common symptom of a thyroid disorder. Many patients experience fluid retention from hypothyroidism, while others have developed it after the onset of symptoms. Patients may not notice their fluid retention until they start experiencing symptoms. Most people who develop fluid retention are younger than 40 years old; however, some elderly women also report fluid retention. [5] In most cases, fluid retention does not require medical treatment. However, fluid retention can be associated with certain complications and conditions. For example, when someone experiences fluid retention due to a poor diet or other factors that decrease the amount of dietary salt in their body, their kidneys can become irritated, which leads to further fluid retention. This condition can cause dehydration, so if you suspect your fluid retention is related to an underlying health problem, such as kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, your doctor might recommend testing for these diseases first. Other causes of fluid retention include severe dehydration (including fasting), high levels of physical stress, vomiting, or diarrhea. Some medications may also worsen fluid retention. Symptoms of fluid retention that don't involve fluids usually begin within 2 weeks of stopping thyroid hormone replacement therapy. The typical duration of fluid retention after stopping hormonal therapy is 6 months. It's important to note, though, that symptoms of fluid retention may continue indefinitely even if you stop taking the medication; in fact, some patients feel better once they've stopped taking their thyroid medication.

In our own experience we are able to recognize some of the signs of depression when it comes to our clients, especially in cases where they have become more isolated from others or when there has been an increase in their level of stress or anxiety. However, we also see that many of them still struggle with this condition despite all these attempts at treatment. One may ask themselves why? Why doesn't the client just stop thinking about it? It seems impossible for us as psychologists to help someone who does not believe in therapy. We may try many methods, yet we still get no result, until one day we realize that while the patient might be depressed, he or she simply isn't talking about it because it is a symptom of the disease. This is the paradox of psychotherapy – its success depends upon the willingness of the person to talk about his problems. The first step in therapy is to identify which symptoms of illness have become prominent and/or if there were any changes in the way that you live your life, the way you relate to other people, or even the way you think. Then you need to figure out what causes the depression. If we do not understand the cause of the problem, then we will be unable to find the solution. To treat the actual problem we require extensive training and thorough research into the subject matter. In case of depression, most experts agree that the proper diagnosis should start from the biological end rather than a chemical one. Many people who are diagnosed with depression don't actually suffer from such a disease as depression can only be recognized by a direct link to brain chemistry. There are also various medications available to treat depression. The medication used depends on whether the person suffers from the mood disorder known as major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) or dysthymia (a form of depression caused by mental problems like obsessive-compulsive tendencies). Sometimes patients feel better after taking anti depressants but they tend to lose their appetite. Also, they sometimes come off the medication due to side effects and eventually relapse. Some people prefer to take an antidepressant medication without having a doctor prescribe it to them. Other times people prefer to use an SSRI antidepressant medication without going through a psychiatrist's office. You should choose the medication based on the type of depression you're suffering from.

If you are experiencing fatigue, dry mouth and difficulty concentrating, then there may be an issue with the digestive tract. Your doctor will need to do a thorough physical examination, including blood work and urine tests.

If it's possible that your condition has been missed or ignored before, your doctor can use a stool test and/or urine drug screen to determine what foods are causing problems for you and how to prevent them. For example, if you're losing weight by avoiding certain foods, try eliminating some of those foods and see if this results in weight loss.

Treatment & Prevention

There are several treatments available for the most common gastrointestinal disorders. Unfortunately, many people aren't able to find the help they require on their own, so doctors may refer patients to specialists who specialize in treating specific conditions.

1. Antiobiotic Therapy

Antibiotics have long been used as a treatment option for infections such as Clostridium difficile, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, HIV and tuberculosis, but the use of antibiotics for other types of digestive diseases remains controversial. In fact, only one type of antibiotic is approved specifically for use against intestinal worms (Helminthopper species).

In addition, despite being widely recognized as effective against parasites, only 10% to 20% of children treated for parasitic infection actually get better and about 50% don't go away completely. It is believed that parasite resistance develops over time and that it may take many years to eradicate all types of worm infection.

2. Probiotics

Some probiotics contain strains of bacteria called Lactobacilli, which are good at breaking down complex proteins. These organisms have also been shown to increase energy levels, decrease inflammation and improve gut flora balance. Since these beneficial bacteria are present naturally in the human gut, researchers believe that introducing them into an ill individual could potentially cure his or her illness, but more studies are needed.

3. Diet Changes

It is thought that people tend to eat too much refined grains and sugars and less vegetables and fruit than they otherwise should. Eating too many unhealthy fats (which often come from processed meat) contributes to inflammation in the body and plays a part in various chronic illnesses like obesity and diabetes. This imbalance between healthy food choices and overall calorie intake causes the symptoms associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as cramps, bloating and diarrhea.

People with type 1 diabetes may need to have their blood sugar levels monitored periodically or they may need medication. This includes taking insulin injections every four hours. In addition, it is not uncommon for people who have Type 1 diabetes to need insulin replacement therapy (insulin pump). Insulin pumps take your insulin from your body through an IV bag that delivers insulin directly into your muscles.

How to treat: The first thing is that you need a doctor to check your blood pressure. If it's higher than 120/80, then they can start with medication that lowers the heart rate and thus reduce the symptoms of this disorder. However, if your blood pressure is more normal (less than 140/90) then they should not start treatment until you take medications such as dantrolene or aspirin.

gpt2-xl_83,"It's all about the patient. A neurologist is not a medical doctor, and doesn't have the expertise to know what you really need from a drug or therapy. And remember that your doctor may have their own biases and beliefs – they might be more likely to prescribe certain drugs than others (for example, they are more apt to see MS in women), and more inclined to use conservative treatment regimens.

It is important for you to discuss with your doctor any side effects you experience such as fatigue, nausea, dizziness, headache, muscle pain, insomnia, loss of appetite, and other symptoms that may be related to your multiple sclerosis diagnosis. Your doctor will want to understand why these symptoms occur after taking your medication regimen, and if you're having any positive/negative reactions, these should also be discussed with them. If you're experiencing negative side effects, ask your doctor how they can help you resolve these.


How many months did you stay on your drug regimen?

The answer here depends on the type of drug being used. For some drugs, like interferons, one month is normal. Some other medications, like Tysabri, may require six months of use before it begins to work effectively. Sometimes, an extended period of time between treatments is required because of research questions. In general, your doctor will tell you at this point whether your drug regimen has been working and whether there may be a longer term benefit in continuing. You'll then receive a letter detailing your results. You do not have to stop your drug regimen immediately; however, when you reach your goal dose for the next cycle, a new letter will be sent letting you know that a reduction or withdrawal of your drug could result in serious adverse reactions. This is especially true when stopping a long-term treatment protocol. If you decide to continue, then you must follow a strict adherence plan. These measures include regular blood tests and monitoring of your brain waves using an EEG device. If you miss a day's dosage due to illness, or are not meeting the goals set out in your prescription, you will be asked to drop back down to the lowest possible dosage, which could mean discontinuing treatment completely. You will never be able to get off a medicine without going through this process.

What are my chances of getting a relapse? How often does this happen?

Your relapse rate depends on several factors, including the severity of your disease and your history of MS. But it is likely that you will run into trouble again sooner or",83,Why get episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis?,-5.52676248550415,98,question,2,0.4188034188034188,433,44

Q. What is the prognosis for the patient?

A. The outlook varies depending on factors including age, type of disease and clinical course. Generally speaking, chemotherapy has a good prognosis. However, because many patients experience relapse after treatment, it is important to follow-up with a biopsy if the tumor remains at least 3 mm in diameter (about 1 inch). For this reason, doctors recommend that all survivors who have been treated with cytotoxic therapy should be followed up by a mammogram every three years.


For those patients whose tumors remain undetected or small at diagnosis, surgical resection may be considered. A study conducted by the American Society of Clinical Oncology found that surgery could provide an additional 10% reduction in overall survival compared to chemotherapy alone. Surgery may be possible if there are complications associated with chemotherapy, such as infection, bleeding, scarring, or other problems. In addition, some experts believe that early staging procedures can improve outcome. Staging, also called initial response to therapy, involves measuring how well a patient responds to treatment before any treatment is started. This means using a combination of laboratory tests to monitor the body's immune system, blood pressure, weight, liver function, and other organ functions; evaluating blood and tissue samples from the abdomen; and examining the prostate gland, bladder, and bowel to determine whether they show signs of disease. This information helps doctors make better decisions about when and how to begin treatment, which ultimately will increase the likelihood that a patient will respond.

Some patients also require more intensive treatments in order to fight the cancer. These include radiation therapy or even stem cell transplantation. According to the National Cancer Institute, most people who undergo these types of therapies live longer than those who don't receive them.

In terms of future treatment options, both immunotherapy drugs and targeted therapeutics are becoming more common in cancer care. Immunotherapy involves trying to block the effects of certain proteins produced by cancer cells. Targeted therapies, on the other hand, target specific cancer cells through a series of different chemicals.

When choosing between chemo and immunotherapy, take into account your individual circumstances, medical needs, and financial situation. Talk to your doctor about whether chemotherapy is right for you.

Some people have been able to successfully manage multiple sclerosis using oral medications that act like steroids. These medicines include prednisone, or Exondys 52®, prednisolone acetate, methylprednisolone acetate, and methylprednisolone sulfate. Other doctors use immunomodulatory drugs called autologous blood products -- vaccines given by a doctor directly into an individual's own bloodstream rather than through a vein. Because these drugs do not contain corticosteroids, they generally don't require daily injections. However, these types of drugs still must be taken consistently throughout the day. A patient might start one dose of one type of vaccine at 5 p.m., then stop for lunch at 8 p.m. If he misses his vaccine, another injection will likely need to be administered shortly thereafter. A common complication of these treatments is allergic reactions. It's important to talk with your health care provider before giving any immunosuppressive therapy to any person.\r

What is my monthly window of opportunity?

The first month after the diagnosis of MS is also the most difficult one to treat effectively. Your MS physician may recommend starting treatment within 1 week of the first symptoms, but many patients find it very helpful if they wait until 2 weeks of new onset, because that is when the immune system has had enough time to build up strength for the next phase of treatment. Most doctors prefer to begin treatment with TNF inhibitors, which block T cells and reduce inflammation. Some doctors say that beginning treatment right away allows more room for improvement as your body gets used to your new disease. As long as your T-cell count stays under 10,000 per milliliter of plasma, doctors usually recommend waiting 6 months before moving to anti-inflammatory drugs such as interferon alpha. Interferon alpha reduces inflammation, and is often recommended for patients who've already started receiving steroids.

gpt2-xl_1,"We live in a ""modern"" world that is full of health problems, but there are some diseases that remain very prevalent. The list below includes common illnesses like asthma, diabetes, arthritis, heart disease, cancer, etc…

The first two diseases listed above represent the big ones. These two major ailments affect more than half of our population. However, these diseases are not just associated with modern lifestyles and technology. Even though we may be aware of them or even suffer from one or several of them, they can still impact us. For example, diabetes has been linked to a number of medical conditions and this makes it extremely hard for patients to manage their condition while on an active lifestyle. Heart disease seems to be growing at a rapid rate as well. While this problem was once thought of simply as a sign of old age, many people today believe it's also caused by excessive exercise and poor diet. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) has been identified as a serious ailment, but its causes continue to elude scientists. This is especially true when it comes to its genetic roots. There may be thousands of different genes involved in CFS, so which specific gene is causing it is unknown and difficult to determine. Although scientists know that stress is the main cause for these disorders, it does not explain why certain individuals are susceptible to each type of illness. It should be noted that many of these illnesses are treatable through simple changes in lifestyle. For example, obesity has been proven to help reverse many diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, etc…

What can I learn about my own life by learning about these common health issues? Some of the common health concerns may seem trivial to you, but if you're already battling one of these conditions then your daily choices might make a huge difference for others who are suffering from similar conditions. If you're interested in pursuing a career in medicine, you could become a physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant (PA). You could even become an internist. Many physicians come from families with previous careers in other professions such as law, teaching, engineering, journalism, etc… Physicians also spend more time practicing than non-physicians because they work long hours and travel frequently. As a result, they often take care of sick family members, friends and neighbors as part of their day jobs. An important note is that all of the above illnesses are preventable. Your actions now could actually save lives later on. In fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),",1,What are the most common chronic diseases?

gpt2-xl_105,"a tooth has to be cut before it can be removed.


Q: How often do you check your teeth?

A: I check my teeth only once or twice per week, and then the same day I am done with that check.


I wash them thoroughly after every brush and flossing (with dental floss). I also rinse all mouthpieces after each meal and snack.


For people who are prone to bleeding gums, brushing their teeth is not enough. You should clean your teeth regularly by using fluoride gel containing 5-10 percent fluoride. This will help reduce tooth decay. Fluoride treatment may be started as soon as possible after you begin seeing results from your regular dentist. It's important to get this treatment under control because the longer your periodontal disease goes untreated, the more damage it can cause. Your dentist will prescribe an appropriate dose for you based on how much of your body is exposed to fluoridated water. To find out what the fluoride concentration in your tap water is, call your local public health office or the Environmental Protection Agency. The National Academy of Sciences estimates that more than three million Americans drink fluoridated water, while another 10 million have the water supply supplied through drinking fountains, bathtubs, showers, and other sources.


Q: What about fluoride gel? What kind should I use?

A: In addition to fluoride tablets, fluoride gels include either 2% sodium fluoride (NaF) or 1% sodium chloride (NaCl) in water. Sodium fluoride comes from fluoridated salt. NaF is absorbed into your system faster than sodium chloride. Because these solutions contain more fluoride than tablets alone, they're safer and easier to swallow.


You can't overdose on fluoride gels; even very small amounts won't make you sick. However, gels don't protect against cavities like fluoride tablets do. If you use two types of fluoride gel together, both types must be used within 24 hours. So if you take one type at bedtime and one during the day, you must switch back and forth between gels. There are two different ways to apply fluoride gel: wetting the inside of your cheek with water and rubbing it into your gums over several minutes. Or, using a cotton swab dipped in water.


To keep your gums healthy, it's best to avoid the use of tobacco products. Gum tissues don't absorb nicotine well, so chewing cigarettes and cigars can lead to tooth decay and gum",105,wisdom tooth cuts gum pain,-11.772644996643066,56,question,2,0.7088607594936709,403,5

This is an example of why you should disclose your MS to everyone, especially if you are a manager or supervisor.

Question: Do you still take medication for your MS when out of the office and away from work? \NAnswer: Yes, currently I do but am considering switching to a different medication in the future if there is no improvement.


Question: How important is it to tell patients about the symptoms of MS and what causes MS?\ nAnswer: The more information we can give a patient about his/her symptoms, the easier it will be for him/her to realize there may be something wrong with his body. I try to explain that people do not get sick because of their genes; rather, diseases like MS happen because the body's natural immune system does not respond properly. We also stress the importance of having regular check ups by doctors.


Question: What type of treatment do you recommend?\NAnswer: Medication is our first line of defense against this disease. A diet rich in vitamin D (approximately 800 IU per day) also helps improve the function of the muscles and joints. Exercise can help decrease pain, inflammation and stiffness. While most treatments such as physical therapy (taping), massage, acupuncture, cortisone injections, electrical stimulation and other types of therapies are not very effective, I strongly encourage patients to participate in any other exercise program provided.

gpt2-xl_35,"Yes, it is. This is because ketosis – the state of being at or near a low carb intake – is an optimal condition for a person with type 1 and 2 diabetes who wants to lose weight. There are two main methods which we will discuss in this guide: intermittent fasting and modified Fast Dieting (this latter technique is called Modified Atkins).

Why Use Ketosis?

There are several reasons why a person would want to use ketosis as their preferred nutritional strategy for losing weight. The first reason is that a ketotic state improves insulin sensitivity. In other words, a ketogenic state causes your body to produce less glucose and more fat. As you can see from our list above, a high-carbohydrate diet actually helps your body burn fat and glycogen and maintain blood sugar levels. If you are on a high carbohydrate diet, then a low-fat diet may work better for you. However, if you have Type 2 Diabetes, reducing carbs does not automatically mean reducing calories; in fact, studies show that even very low calorie diets can help reduce triglycerides! It's important to understand that a ketogenic diet reduces inflammation and promotes healthy heart function. In short, ketones are great for your health.

The second reason to use ketosis is that ketosis allows us to burn more fat than we consume and thus improve metabolic flexibility. While some people need to eat very little fat in order to maintain a stable weight while trying to lose weight, others don't have to do anything special. People with Type 1 Diabetes often struggle to achieve weight loss because they have difficulty burning fat due to insulin resistance (the result of having too much insulin circulating in your bloodstream). When you remove insulin from the equation, your body burns energy for fuel instead of storing fat. This makes it easier for you to get leaner through exercise or by simply changing your diet to one rich in low-glycemic carbohydrates. And, yes, you can still enjoy the benefits of a low-carb diet without using the techniques outlined below!

It is important to note though that there are certain foods you should avoid when you try to eat to your ideal body composition. For example, nuts and seeds (which contain large amounts of phytic acid) are especially bad for someone with Type 1 Diabetes. Also, eating lots of eggs or dairy products (even cottage cheese!) decreases fat oxidation (i.e., fat burning) by 30% and increases dietary protein synthesis (a process involving breaking down protein into amino acids), so this",35,Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?,-0.0322153456509113,2,question,2,0.012903225806451613,427,37

2. Exercise duration – is it all about the reps?

Answer: yes and no

Aerobic exercises like running and cycling are good for increasing stamina in both short term and long term effects. Resistance training on the other hand has been proven to increase strength and power but only short-term (a few weeks). The best way to increase your endurance is by getting a daily session of aerobic exercise at least 3 times per week.

3. How much do you need to do?

Answer: depends on your goals

It is important to get your body into an optimal condition before undertaking any new fitness program. This means that you should start with a routine that includes some type of cardiovascular activity so that you will have enough energy to go through the whole plan. That said if you are going to embark on this journey then consider working out three days a week (5-6 sets) while eating nutritious meals every 2 hours or more than 6 hrs each day.

4. Is there a ""one size fits all"" workout?

Answer: not necessarily. Some people might benefit from doing a little bit more cardio work than others while others may be better suited for higher intensity exercises such as weight lifting or circuit training. You will know which type of workout works best for you based on the exercises you use and the intensity you achieve in each one.

If you are feeling tired after just 5 minutes of cardio work then try to break up your workout with longer bouts of high intensity exercise. For example, try running for 20 minutes followed by walking for 30 minutes or cycling for 15 minutes followed by jogging for 10 minutes. It could take anywhere from 2-10 sessions to reach full recovery. But keep in mind that you can't expect to walk around half your normal speed during these workouts.

5. What if I want to run/bike/swim/etc.?

Answer: that's awesome! There are many ways to exercise when you don't want to push yourself too hard. If you want to jump on the bike or swim you would probably enjoy the workout much more than someone who wants to run the entire marathon in under 4 hours.

As far as how long each workout lasts depends largely on the individual but it's generally between 1 hour and 2 hours.

The next question is about exercise equipment\nAnswer: There are a lot of different types of exercise machines, but in general you'll be using one that has handles or pedals on the front and another type which also comes with handlebars but without pedals. For example, some people use treadmills and others use bicycles to work out at home. The most common kind of exercise machine available is called an aerobic or resistance training machine (sometimes referred to as an exercise bike). Aerobic training machines have wheels so they can spin on both sides of the body (on one side if your legs are longer than your torso) while performing various exercises such as walking, jogging, swimming, running and cycling. Resistance training machines use bands or cables to pull or push weights up against resistance plates connected by pulleys. They're generally used for strength training.

What types of weight training do I need?

There are two main forms of weight lifting: linear and compound. Linear means that you lift progressively heavier objects over time. Compound means that you combine multiple movements into one movement – for instance, squats, deadlifts, bench presses and shoulder press. Each type of weightlifting requires different tools and equipment and requires you to perform specific exercises. You may want to refer back to our earlier answer to see what kind of weightlifting equipment is recommended.


Linear Strength Training Machine - this machine uses straight bars with either handles or straps to add resistance, but doesn't come equipped with wheels. Some machines do offer a wheel system for certain exercises, however, these usually aren't very good quality, and not all machines actually include wheels anyway. This type of weightlifting machine is ideal for beginners because it's easier to learn how to use, and less likely to break down. It's best to keep track of your reps, sets and rest periods using a timer or stopwatch. To get the most out of this machine, start slow and make sure you spend enough time working through each rep before moving onto the next. A common mistake is to try to increase your total reps over time rather than focusing on getting more reps per set. If you find yourself reaching failure after 3-4 repetitions before increasing volume, then something isn't right. Once you've learned the proper form and technique, then gradually increase the weight and/or move up the difficulty level. Linear strength training is often associated with powerlifters who use them to build their upper bodies.

head pats scalp psoriasis

Headpats

A scalp pats is a type of facial massage technique, that involves rubbing the skin with the palms of your hands. A scalp pats is used to relieve itching caused by inflammation or infection in the hair follicles.

Symptoms and Types

Depending on the cause, there are two types of scalp pats. The first type consists of gentle rubbing of one hand over the back part of the scalp (the part where hair grows). In this condition, some patients report having only mild discomfort.

The second type usually involves pulling the fingers of one hand under one's chin and moving them upwards to rub the forehead, which causes more pain. Often, sufferers also experience itchiness and redness in their eyes.

If you have severe scalp psoriasis, you may notice an increase in your symptoms after experiencing a scalp pats. This is especially true if your scalp has been involved with rashes for long periods of time, such as from eating spicy foods, smoking, using tobacco or from excessive sun exposure. You should consult your doctor immediately if you begin experiencing any signs of scalp psoriasis following a scalp pats.

Causes

Scalp psoriasis can be caused by environmental factors, such as dandruff, certain medications, hormone changes or infections such as herpes simplex virus.

Risk Factors

People who carry the Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1, commonly known as HSV-1, are at higher risk for developing scalp psoriasis than those without this virus. Having frequent genital contact with an infected person, particularly during adolescence, increases your risk of developing scalp psoriasis.

Complications

There are no reports of significant complications arising from scalp pats. However, since scalp pats are a common form of physical exercise, they are not recommended for everyone.",132,headpats scalp psoriasis,-0.0034383959136903,0,question,2,0.0,293,21

Question: is there anything I can do to prevent a flare up? Answer: yes you can. make sure you are taking your meds as directed and get plenty of rest and take care of yourself with good diet, exercise and sleep.

Q3 – I suffer from eczema. How long does it last? A – Eczema will always run its course. It lasts for about 6 months or longer in most cases. But this varies between people depending on how sensitive they are to certain triggers. Sometimes it flares up and doesn't go away entirely.

Question: my daughter has eczema, I want her to see if she can help me. Should I give her some creams? Answer – If she's used them safely, no, it won't hurt her. In fact, it might even be beneficial. She may stimulate the immune system because she is ""in tune"" with the environment. This may mean she gets more antibodies against bacteria and other allergens. Her skin will still feel dry/itching when she goes swimming or sweating and it may be red and swollen at times (sometimes called bullous eruption) but it won't itch like an allergic rash would. Also, because she's been using these creams properly, it won't hurt her too much after she stops. In addition to her usual treatments, here are some things you could try: 1. Take her on a daily probiotic supplement (like Echinacea). Probiotics contain both good Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains. They are very good in helping to heal acne, especially inflammatory acne. 2. Try a vitamin C cream (such as Retin-A or Vitamin A). 3. Use tea tree oil on the affected areas once or twice per week. 4. Take antihistamines such as Albuterol or Benadryl. 5. Consider giving her a prescription topical steroid product (such as Neutrogena Ultra Power Ultra Moisturizer). 6.

Q. What is the best time to have a home pregnancy test?A. You can use it as early as possible after you've been pregnant and before you go into labour or if you are very far along in your pregnancy, so that your body has plenty of time to absorb it (within 1-3 hours). If you take your first test when you're still in your period – within 2 weeks postpartum – then it won't give accurate results until more than three months later (after 7-10 days postpartum) or 3 months afterwards (more than 10 days postpartum), unless you are on an oral contraceptive (such as Yasmin®). You should avoid taking a home pregnancy test at night, even if the light is off (if you're on any type of medication or don't want to be bothered by the blood). The last thing you need is an inaccurate reading!You might also consider testing more frequently, especially if you're worried about spotting or am expecting twins – because this will help you spot problems earlier, which may mean less anxiety for both you and your partner.Q. Why do I sometimes get false positive tests at my doctor's surgery?A. Many women who've been through IVF/ICSI can recognise these signs – they could possibly be due to things like a small tear in the membrane between your vagina and cervix causing a leaky pregnancy test, faulty batteries, or too many tests performed in the first 24-48 hours of your menstrual cycle. Some doctors simply forget to perform them properly, others change their mind once the treatment has started. You should contact your midwife directly for advice on what may cause these issues.Q. How often do my home pregnancy tests need to be re-tested?A. All home pregnancy tests must be checked again every 4 weeks by your health professional unless you specifically ask for them not to be checked at all.If you want to find out whether the test worked at some point during the test series, you can always call our customer service team on 0300 123 2323 where we'll advise you further. If a pregnancy test doesn't work, you should be offered a replacement from our customer services team immediately.Q. Can a home pregnancy test detect trisomy 21?A.

Q: How does multiple sclerosis impact the quality of life?\nAnswer: Multiple sclerosis affects many aspects of daily life – including your ability to communicate, interact socially, manage relationships, and maintain personal hygiene and appearance. These factors can be reduced when MS symptoms are managed effectively by your health care team and/or other people who live with you. However, some people may experience significant limitations due to their disability, including social isolation, inability to participate in social activities, difficulty making decisions about personal care, and limited involvement in community life. This may make the individual feel isolated or depressed. For example, if someone has both chronic fatigue syndrome and MS, they may face considerable difficulties finding employment as a result of social stigma associated with the combination of symptoms. Some people also report feeling trapped in their own bodies, with no way out, even though they know there is something more than what they see on the outside. People living with multiple sclerosis often suffer from significant stressors related to their condition; however, there is no cure for MS, so managing these stressors is important to maintaining well-being. For individuals with moderate to severe MS, life may become increasingly complex and challenging through the onset and worsening of symptoms. You may require assistance with mobility, balance, speech, vision, and sensory function. You may need specialized equipment that may include a wheelchair, a walker, or a cane for assistance in walking around your home or workplace.

gpt2-xl_54,"Multiple Sclerosis is a neurological disorder that involves the central nervous system and affects approximately 1 in every 3,000 people. People with MS experience severe disability on two sides of their body. The symptoms are typically worse when walking or using movement tools, and they can be debilitating. Many of those who have MS also experience loss of vision (visual impairment), hearing problems, bladder control issues, muscular weakness, and difficulty swallowing.\r

\r

The disease progresses slowly over time, but eventually it causes irreversible damage to the brain's ability to send messages between cells (neurologic deficit). Without treatment, people will usually die before age 40. \r

\r

Multiple Sclerosis can develop at any age, even during childhood. In young children, symptoms may not appear until adolescence or early adulthood; however, by the mid-20s many children may show signs of MS.\r

\r

In most cases, multiple sclerosis is diagnosed through a physical exam or an MRI scan. During the examination, your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and what happens around your home and work. Your doctor may order blood tests as well. These tests determine if there might be a problem with your immune system (antibody) levels; whether your immune system has been damaged due to another condition such as cancer; and how long ago you had a previous episode of MS.\r

\r

At this point, your doctor may prescribe medicines called ""MS drugs"" that help improve or slow some of the effects of MS. These drugs, sometimes referred to as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), target specific proteins in MS patients' brains that cause inflammation and other symptoms. Some mAbs, like Imbruvica, are available without a prescription, while others, including Interferon Beta, must be prescribed.\r

\r

Once you have a good idea of what the problem might be, your doctor may suggest different treatments for you based on your individual circumstances. You could try one drug after another or take more than one medicine at once. Treatment choices depend on several factors, including your general health, your risk factors for developing MS (such as age, sex, family history, smoking status, and alcohol use), and the nature of the disease and its progression. For example, someone who takes high doses of interferon beta daily because of a genetic predisposition for MS risks losing the ability to feel pain.\r

gpt2-xl_51,"The term ""holistic"" was coined by Dr. Joseph Mercola in his book ""The Superfood Plan."" According to the author, a well balanced diet should contain all of the nutrients required for good health including vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, C, D, E, folic acid, thiamine and riboflavin. This will help you meet your vitamin and mineral requirements while reducing inflammation and supporting optimal health of the immune system. \n

How does it work?\nIn the case of this dietary program, the body uses natural anti-inflammatories from foods such as: flaxseed, chia seeds, pumpkin seed, walnuts, omega 3 fatty acids (ALA), fish oil, garlic and turmeric, and also supports other essential enzymes that are involved with proper digestion and elimination. These enzymes help break down proteins, carbohydrates, fats and connective tissues into smaller components needed by the cells which have to go through the digestive process; otherwise there can be an accumulation of waste material.\n

Why do I need to use this type of nutritional supplementation?\nWell known deficiencies or conditions associated with chronic illness include chronic fatigue syndrome, allergies, thyroid problems, inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis. Inflammation and oxidative stress is believed to contribute to these disorders but the source of the damage remains unknown. Anti-inflammatory supplements have been shown to reduce the symptoms of many diseases such as multiple sclerosis and even diabetes.

What are the benefits of holistic nutrition?\nHealthy eating is about more than just choosing healthy food sources. It's also important to find out what makes each food source so beneficial and incorporate those types of foods into your meals without altering your normal diets. For example, eating fruits like apples has many health benefits including preventing cancer, heart disease and stroke, helping control blood sugar levels, controlling weight, improving digestion and increasing your overall energy level. Other fruit products found to provide high antioxidant content include cranberries and blueberries. \n

When should I take my supplements?\nYour healthcare provider will recommend taking supplements at various times throughout the day depending on how you feel and what type of food you're consuming. However, it is best to consult a professional before attempting any dietary changes. Remember, the only way to know if something is working or not is to test them yourself. Also make sure to monitor your intake throughout the course of the week since this could affect your tolerance over time.

Q. What is the most common cause?\nAnswer: Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS), which occurs when abnormal immune cells attack and destroy myelin sheaths that surround nerves in your body. The disease progresses over time due to damage to the brain, spinal cord and other areas of the CNS. Symptoms may include loss of balance or coordination, numbness, weakness and difficulty with swallowing. In some cases, it may become difficult for patients to communicate, walk or even swallow. In severe cases, these problems may cause mental impairment, difficulty communicating and decreased ability to use muscles or movement skills. Common causes of MS are infection, trauma, genetic mutations, infections during pregnancy or labor, exposure to toxins such as lead from paint or environmental pollution, autoimmune conditions including thyroid disorders or rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, medications, stroke or seizures. It also happens more often in women than men.

There is no evidence that any of the symptoms, diseases, disabilities, or illnesses described above are caused by MS alone. It is important to note that the term ""ALS"" includes all neurodegenerative, degenerative, and neurological diseases. The specific symptoms associated with each disease vary. Some have symptoms similar to those of MS; others are different. However, they should all be considered separately because they all share many features.",68,List of multiple sclerosis symptoms,-0.6759553551673889,8,question,2,0.03619909502262444,269,13

Stage 1: neurological symptoms; no vision loss, loss of bowel control, difficulty swallowing. Stage 2: severe weakness/problems walking and balance; problems with speech or comprehension; headaches. The brain may be damaged. Stage 3: paralysis of part of the body; numbness in one side of the body; loss of bladder function. Brain damage is irreversible. A person who has stage 3 MS might not have any symptoms and might be able to live a normal life. If the disease progresses, it may eventually affect your thinking, speaking, seeing, hearing, breathing, and ability to swallow food. Some people develop progressive neuropathy (nerve pain), which causes numbness or tingling on the hands and feet. Many more people develop peripheral neuropathies, such as ataxia, muscle spasms, dysarthria, and blindness. All these things can cause some of the same problems that you experience with MS.

The number of MS-related conditions also continues to grow rapidly. This means there's no way to know how many people will get MS before diagnosis. The most common are type 1 diabetes mellitus, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis, psoriatic arthritis, scleroderma, Lyme disease, Graves' disease, postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic polyneuropathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, interstitial cystitis, fibromyalgia, migraine headache, epilepsy, depression, bipolar disorder, dementia, schizophrenia, irritable bowel syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Parkinson's disease.

What Are the Most Common Symptoms?

Some people with MS report being bothered by a range of physical symptoms that often begin suddenly and become worse over time. These may include joint pains (spasm), blurred vision, trouble moving one leg or arm, headaches, vision problems, memory problems, problems sleeping, mood swings, and depression.

Other Problems With MS That Affect People's Quality of Life Include:

Pain from MS affects about 5% of all adults with MS. It usually starts between 12 months and 24 months after getting the first MS lesion, but it can occur earlier or later depending on what other diseases, medical conditions, genetics, lifestyle choices, age, and the activity level of an individual.

Q: What is secondary progressive multiple sclerosis?\nAnswer: Multiple sclerosis is one of the most common chronic diseases affecting people aged 50 to 80 years. People with this condition are said to have had an initial attack that caused symptoms similar to those seen in rheumatoid arthritis but it didn't resolve on its own. Many people with MS experience fatigue, muscle weakness, memory loss, difficulty swallowing, bladder incontinence, speech problems, headaches, and vision changes. At any given time, 25% to 35% of individuals with MS also have osteoarthritis (a painful condition of the joints). Source: http://www.cdc.gov/mss/ms/symptoms.htm

Q: What causes primary progressive multiple sclerosis?\nAnswer: There aren't certain reasons why MS develops and no one gene has been found to cause it. However, several risk factors, such as smoking, obesity and being older than 40 years old, have been linked with an increased risk of developing MS. Another factor that appears to increase the risk of developing MS is exposure to toxins, including lead, arsenic, mercury, cadmium, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) such as TCE, DDT, PCBs and hexavalent chromium. These compounds can damage cells throughout the body. Source: http://webmd.medscape.com/viewarticle/735453_1

Q: How does secondary progressive multiple sclerosis differ from primary progressive multiple sclerosis?\nAnswer: A person may develop primary progressive MS at any point during his or her life; however, some people have symptoms for decades before they develop secondary progressive MS. In contrast, someone who has secondary progressive MS might not realize he or she is having a relapse until it is too late. Both conditions are characterized by slow progression. As well, there may be periods when multiple sclerosis attacks people repeatedly without causing any symptoms",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-0.0366657637059688,19,question,2,0.14285714285714285,340,21

Other factors may also play a role in the development of sleep disorders.[10],[11] The incidence of diabetes mellitus is often associated with a high prevalence of sleep difficulties.[12] This association suggests that there could be a link between sleep disturbance and other health conditions such as diabetes.

Q: What is the best way to get the vaccine if you are under 5 years old and have not had it before?\nAnswer: There is no ""best"" age, just like with any other vaccination. You should be given the first dose as soon as possible after your child's birthday (usually February). The recommended schedule is shown on our Vaccine Schedule page or by contacting us at 1-(800) 871-4357. If there is a delay in getting the vaccine, call 2-1-1 and let someone know what the problem is so that they can send out the correct vaccine(s).

Q: Are vaccines made with aborted human fetuses safe?\nAnswer: The vaccine maker does not make their products using fetal cells. However, if a person who has received the vaccine becomes ill within 3 months of receiving this vaccine, the vaccine may not work properly. In such cases, the patient should receive another shot of the same type and number of doses of the vaccine. A new injection should be used. This also applies to adults under 18 years old. To prevent complications from this vaccine, parents and caregivers must follow all directions on the package insert for the vaccine and must notify the manufacturer if they suspect an adverse reaction. It is important that everyone who receives the vaccine takes care to keep the area where he/she will store the vaccine clean and dry between administrations.

What is the most effective treatment for prostate cancer?

The standard of care is surgery to remove all or part of the prostate. This is known as radical prostatectomy, and there are many types of this procedure. For example, a prostatectomy called a DRA is done with a laser and may be used in men who have advanced stage disease and no other treatments are available. Other radical prostatectomies involve removing both the prostate and other parts of the urogenital system (such as the bladder), while others remove only one of these two systems. The last type is the PSA-based Prostate Cancer Treatment by Radiation (PCTR) which removes the entire prostate and its surrounding lymph nodes to improve survival rates.

Prostate cancer treatment depends on the cancer cell's type and location of metastasis. Different methods of treating prostate cancer can also depend upon the patients' age, symptoms, lifestyle habits, other risk factors, and the results of imaging tests. The following table summarizes the benefits and risks associated with prostate cancer treatments.

Q: Is the risk of developing MS reduced by smoking?

A: No, it is not. It may have a small reduction in some people, but there are other factors that contribute and this does not change the overall picture.


What about other environmental factors such as diet, physical activity, or sun exposure? Most of these can affect the risk of developing MS. The question should be asked on the basis of studies which use data from populations where people do not smoke, drink alcohol or take drugs. Such studies cannot tell us what happens if you are exposed to some chemical agents, such as asbestos.


Q: How safe is the current standard of care for treating patients with MS?

A: Many doctors see the results of clinical trials to decide whether to recommend treatment with new medications. The results can differ depending on who takes part in the study. In general, they find that the risks of side effects are lower than the benefits, and most think that the use of new medicines poses too great a risk to benefit outweighs their potential benefits.


For example, taking aspirin reduces the chance of having a heart attack by 25 percent; however, this has been shown to increase the chances of death from all causes. Taking an aspirin daily lowers your risk of cancer by 20 percent. But, this also increases your chances of dying of lung cancer; so one would expect the net benefit of taking aspirin to be less than its cost. Aspirin probably makes you feel better, but does not reduce the likelihood of getting a serious illness.


The same goes for most new drugs. A few of them do offer significant improvement over existing treatments. For example, statins reduce blood cholesterol levels by 15-20 percent, reducing the risk of heart attacks, strokes and some cancers. However, the large majority of people treated with statins suffer side effects such as nausea, constipation, dizziness and abdominal pain. Some patients need long courses of medicine. One could argue that if the side effects of statins were worse, more people would choose them. This seems unlikely given that many patients have no problems with statins at all.",58,Risk to develop multiple sclerosis,-3.769040584564209,29,question,2,0.12554112554112554,369,11

Q: What is a ""core-strengthening"" core workout?


A: A core strengthening workout will help strengthen muscles that support your spine.

Some of these exercises include:

-Plank hold

-Cable crunch (holds for 30 seconds)

-Hyperextension exercise (holds for 60 sec)

-Wall sit (sit on a wall with legs straight out in front of you, feet flat on the ground)

-Bent over pull up, lying face down on the floor. Use a chair or bench if possible. You should be able to bend forward completely by using just your upper arms. Hold this for 10 seconds, then lower yourself back down until your shoulders are resting against the seat. Repeat 4 times. Try to do it about 3x per week. This is great exercise for those who have trouble sitting without having pain.

-Upright rows, lying supine with elbows bent

-Reverse crunches, laying on your stomach and pulling your head back as far as possible without turning your torso too much. The key here is to stay calm during each rep, keep an even tension throughout. Also try to focus on pushing your abs hard.

-Weighted chin ups on the weight set. Do 25 reps, rest 2 minutes between sets.

-Pull-up variations. For example, you can do rows instead of chin ups, or use the weighted version.

-Alternate dumbbell curls and tricep extensions with biceps cable curls. Make sure you alternate between all three sets and make sure you finish each set with full range of motion.

gpt2-xl_117,"yes, patients have been cured of stage 4 metastatic lung cancers.

Question: How long do you expect the treatment to last? Answer: The treatment lasts for 2 years from start to finish. There are two periods during which the therapy is active. During the first period (6 months) there may be a reduction in tumour size, but it will not necessarily go away completely. If this occurs, the second phase begins and is designed to increase survival rates by targeting secondary or distant malignancies. This phase of therapy has also shown promise as an alternative to surgery. In the case of CML, the drug can target both primary tumours at once, allowing for more rapid and effective clearance of the disease than if only one type of tumour was targeted (see above).

Other aspects of the study

This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded trial that assessed all available therapies against chemotherapy alone with the aim of achieving better outcomes.

The investigators studied four groups:

Group 1 - Treatment as usual (taken after diagnosis of melanoma), followed by standard doses of pomalidomide (60 mg/day, divided into three daily doses).

Group 2 - Treatment as usual (taken before diagnosis of melanoma), followed by standard doses of pomalidomide (60 mg/day, divided into two daily doses).

Group 3 - POMILANDOMIDE plus radiation therapy (pomalidomide + radiotherapy);

group 4 - POMILANDOMIDE plus standard doses of pomalidomide (60 mg/day, divided into three daily doses).

All participants had their tumors removed. They were monitored until they were no longer experiencing any symptoms associated with early stages of cancer.

When analysing results for overall survival, no significant difference between group 1 and group 4 was found. However, when looking specifically at overall survival with progression-free survival (PFS), treatment with pomalidomide plus radiation therapy was significantly better than treatment with standard doses of pomalidomide. In comparison, a statistically insignificant difference was noted between treatment with radiation therapy alone and therapy with pomalidomide + radiotherapy.

In total, 1048 people participated in this trial. Of these, 1027 completed treatment. Overall, 810 people survived the course of treatment, including five who died of other causes within 12 weeks (one of whom was on pomalidomide).

A) Eating foods that are a source of saturated fatty acids, such as meats, butter, cheese, eggs, cream and other dairy products. Saturated fats have been shown to reduce cholesterol in the blood and this is very important for heart disease prevention. A high intake of saturated fats has also been found to increase LDL-C (bad cholesterol). The reason why it increases bad cholesterol is because of a chemical called docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which is mainly produced by algae and marine animals, but also found in some fish oils. It can be converted into another type of fat called eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which lowers serum triglycerides. This is known as DHA to EPA conversion ratio. One study showed that omega 3 fatty acids reduce total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol while increasing HDL-cholesterol; therefore they may help lower risk of heart disease. There is evidence that these fats inhibit formation of new cholesterol cells in the liver and prevent accumulation of lipid droplets in the arteries. Another study shows that people who consumed three or more servings per week had less plaque build up in their coronary arteries than those consuming no fatty acids. Therefore it seems likely that there could be benefits from the consumption of omega 3 fats. B) Consuming whole grains and vegetables. Whole grain foods like wheat bran, barley and oats are rich sources of fiber which improves digestion and reduces inflammation. These whole grain foods also provide vitamin C, magnesium, potassium and various phytochemicals like lignans (phytoestrogens), sesamin, folate, choline and phytic acid. They also contain selenium, manganese, zinc and iron. Nuts, seeds, avocado and olive oil, among others, are also good sources of healthy fats. C) Sticking to a Mediterranean diet. The Mediterranean Diet was developed based on a scientific review of the available data about diet and health. It consists of a variety of foods that consist of fresh fruits, vegetables and legumes, cooked with olive oil, lemon juice, garlic and spices, all in moderation. In particular, nonfat milk, yogurt, cheese and butter should be avoided. Foods such as white bread, white rice, pasta, pastas and potatoes have an added dietary fibre and thus help maintain bowel movements.

What is psychodynamic therapy? \nAnswer: a theory that suggests the development of personal identity from within. The idea is that as a person grows up, he or she creates his or her own unique personality. Psychodynamic therapists believe that the way people handle stress affects their feelings about themselves, which then influences their choices. They also view life as being interwoven with our feelings about other people, and are not afraid to examine issues that may cause stress.

Psychodynamic therapy was introduced by Carl Jung. He studied it in depth in the 1920s and 1930s. It has since become widely accepted throughout the world and is used by many physicians and psychiatrists. In addition, some psychologists have developed psychoanalytic theories that attempt to explain away certain types of negative feelings.

Why use psychodynamic therapy for depression? \nAnswer: Because while most treatments focus on one problem at a time, psychodynamic therapy focuses on changing your entire attitude toward each situation. This approach makes it easier to identify potential problems before they lead to more serious emotional problems. When you start to feel sad or depressed, talk to someone who understands your issues. If you can't figure out how to fix things yourself, see if you can find someone else who will help you.

How do I go about learning psychodynamic therapy? \nAnswer: There are many ways to learn psychodynamic therapy. You could join a group like Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, where everyone listens to an individual session on tape. Or try books about psychodynamic therapy, such as Richard Gardner's book, ""The Way of Psychoanalysis."" These books cover the basics of psychodynamic therapy, but also discuss some of the different methods used by psychotherapists today.

\t\tThe best way to prevent type 2 diabetes is through good diet, regular exercise and a balanced lifestyle, including adequate sleep. \r

\t\tDiabetes can be prevented by managing blood glucose levels, which are controlled by controlling food intake, body weight and physical activity.\r

\t\tSome people may have more than one form of the disease but only one or a few types are responsible for most cases.\r

\r

1. How many types of diabetes are there?\r

There are three main types of diabetes:\r

Type 1 Diabetes (also known as Juvenile Diabetes) is a genetic disorder that results in rapid development of adult-onset symptoms, such as increased thirst and urination, rapid weight gain and early puberty. Type 2 diabetes occurs when either the insulin needed to control blood sugar level (called insulin) does not work properly or it works too well, resulting in hyperglycemia or high blood sugar levels. It also causes damage to the pancreas and other organs. Approximately 75% of all adults with type 2 diabetes will develop cardiovascular problems over their lifetime.\r

2. What causes type 2 diabetes?\r

In general, diabetes develops due to lack of insulin production by beta cells located within the endocrine system, specifically, the islets of Langerhans found within the pancreas. This is often referred to as ""insulin resistance"". Insulin helps control blood sugar levels by stimulating the breakdown of stored carbohydrates into sugars called glycogen. When there isn't enough insulin being produced, fat cells begin to store excess energy in fatty acids instead of glucose. Eventually, these stores become so large they eventually burn up their contents, causing a state of ""starvation ketosis"" that leads to hypoglycemia.\r

3. Which nutrients affect type 2 diabetes?\r

Foods high in protein increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes by increasing insulin secretion. High carbohydrate diets tend to decrease insulin release and lead to an increase in blood sugar levels without having any nutritional benefit.\r

4. Are there certain foods you should avoid?\r

High-protein, low carbohydrate diets that include red meat and processed meats, dairy products, sweets and sugary drinks, and alcohol are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.\r

Question: What is the cause of migraine headaches?

Answer: The cause of migraine headaches is a combination of factors such as genetic, hormonal, environmental, and psychological factors. Migraine sufferers who have been diagnosed with this disease often report that their symptoms started sometime in childhood or early adolescence, while they were still teenagers. They described how they used to get migraines on certain days when their teachers would make fun of them at school. For instance, they would feel very bad when their teachers asked them questions such as ""are you having your period today?"" This made it difficult for the sufferer to study and concentrate during school time. Some sufferers also reported feeling more intense during sex. They claimed that these feelings were similar to the ones that some people get when they have an orgasm. As a result of experiencing the headaches at such times, a person could suffer from the following problems.

Questions for which the answers were not available on their websites:

1. Is it true that one of every three American women will get breast cancer in her lifetime?

2. Are you aware that, since the 1970s, more than 100 million babies have been aborted worldwide? Answer: No

3. Does a woman's age matter when it comes to having an abortion? Answer: Yes

4. Did you know that many doctors are now telling women who are considering having an abortion they should postpone it until after their baby is born? Answer: Yes

5. If I am pregnant and have a miscarriage how soon do I go back to work or school? Answer: You can return to your job or school as soon as you are able. The sooner you begin treatment the better the outcome. However, if you are taking medication for a pre-existing condition or you feel you need to take certain medications before getting pregnant, talk with your doctor about what could affect your pregnancy. If you decide to continue your pregnancy it is important to make sure your health insurance covers any medical expenses related to the miscarriage or premature delivery.

6. What does it mean when an egg has come from a man but has no sperm in it yet? Answer: In this situation there may be chromosomal abnormalities present. This would explain why ovulation was delayed or missing altogether. Women with abnormal eggs have had miscarriages or stillbirths. It also means that you cannot become pregnant by artificial insemination (AI) and/or IVF. Your only option is natural conception.

7. How long does it take to recover from an induced abortion? Answer: Most people are able to resume normal activities within 12 hours. After two weeks most women can be back at work or school, although some require additional time to regain normal hormone levels. Some women who have had abortions later in life report feeling guilty because they did not try to keep the pregnancy. They may feel guilty because of feelings such as sadness, guilt and grief over the loss of a child. Acknowledge these feelings and try to understand them without being judgmental.

Q8. What should I do if my child is having a fever that does not stop when I take the medicine?

A8. If your child has a fever for more than 4 days, do not give him or her any medicines (unless you know how to use them). Call the doctor right away. Tell all health care providers and pharmacists who treat your child about what happened. Do not stop giving the medicine without checking with the doctor first. Keep taking the medication as soon as it works. Check with your doctor right away if your child's fever continues or stops suddenly. A sudden decrease in fever may be an emergency.

What are other risks from using this medicine?

This medicine passes into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. You and your child's doctor should decide if this medicine should continue being used during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Talk with your child's doctor. Your child's weight also may change while using this medicine. Ask your doctor before making any changes in diet or exercise program.

Pregnancy Category D: This medicine might cause birth defects if used by pregnant women or those trying to become pregnant. It might also harm an unborn baby. Stop using this medicine and tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant while using it.

gpt2-xl_109,"yes, as it is a combination of two conditions. The first one is hirsutism and the second one is an enlarged spleen that often causes blood in your urine (and you should never give any medicines containing metformin to pregnant women).

Question: what causes hirsutism? Answer: Hirsutism is caused by too much estrogen in your body. When you have excessive amounts of estrogen in your body, it can cause a lot of problems including hair loss, excess facial and body hair growth, acne, weight gain, irregular menstrual periods, male infertility and sterility. In fact, only about 50% of people with this condition get it cured. So if you suffer from it or just want to prevent it, there are some things that you can do for sure. First of all, you need to lose some of the excess amount of estrogen in your system before you get it again. As an example, you could stop taking certain medications such as birth control pills for at least six months or take a contraceptive pill every day. However, there's also a risk involved if you use sex toys. For instance, a woman who uses vibrators when she has heavy periods will probably be affected by hirsutism. If you really want to know more about the risks associated with using sex toys, you might wish to ask your gynecologist.

Question: where does hirrotism come from? Answer: It's a side effect of a medication called clomiphene citrate. Clomiphene is used to treat menopause symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats. This drug is most commonly prescribed for post-menopausal women suffering from severe symptoms such as hot flashes or night sweats. You may also be given it on its own for other reasons such as anxiety or depression. The problem occurs because it increases estrogen levels in your body which causes your body to produce too much hormones. One of these hormones is estrogen so it becomes very dangerous. The increased amount of estrogen leads to the production of a hormone that is similar to testosterone in the female body and this hormone then goes into your bloodstream and eventually reaches your ovaries. These hormones may cause unwanted effects like premature aging and breast enlargement. Your doctor needs to check whether you are getting enough natural estrogens such as those found in foods or through supplements. It is important not to use clomiphene while having children since the potential side effects are even worse. Also, make sure you don't abuse the drugs such as drinking alcohol",109,ehlers danlos syndrome POTS nausea stomach pain,-12.031401634216309,37,question,3,0.925,421,0

Interviewer: question, what was your initial response to the diagnosis of leukemia?

Medical student: I think it is the worst news that we ever receive. We had no idea that this was possible for us at such a young age.

Medical Student: The news did not come as a surprise for me, but seeing a patient have such a serious problem in his body, and being the first time you are dealing with it yourself makes it that much more difficult. Even though there was so little information available on the subject, we knew that it could happen to any child.

Mental health students: We were shocked by the news of our classmate having leukemia. It surprised us because he had been doing so well up until then, and we thought maybe the leukemia just went away on its own. Now we know better.

Medical Student: I'm also surprised how quickly the cancer came back after his bone marrow transplant. He has been treated so well in the past two years through chemo and stem cell treatments. This time around, we're concerned about the treatment he will be receiving now since he cannot donate his bone marrow. We want him to get better before he can donate his bone marrow, which would help many other children with cancers like his in the future.

Interviewer: what do you remember most from that day?

Medical Student: At that moment, I felt as if everything in my life was over. The doctors told us that we had one week to decide whether we wanted to continue chemotherapy. I asked myself why they needed to tell us what to do at the last minute when it seemed like something that I'd already decided on.

What is the difference between a wisdom tooth and a baby's baby? Wisdom teeth are very small and can be difficult to see during dental exams and x-rays. They have no root or main cavity, so they do not pose any risk of infection when swallowed by an infant. The number of wisdom teeth that will form depends on how many days are in the month (in months). A baby has one more than a person does at birth, but most children have 3 or 4 wisdom teeth. There may also be other types of wisdom teeth that need treatment such as crooked/nonworking ones, those that don't grow properly, or others that might become infected if left untreated.


Wisdom teeth are removed through dental extraction (duplication) of the tooth. When wisdom teeth are extracted, they typically heal within 12 hours with no permanent harm to the jaw. With age wisdom teeth start to harden and become more painful. In severe cases, a dentist can remove them completely using a radical tooth extraction procedure called Denture Extraction or Denture Reconstructive Procedures.

Q&A With Tim Ferris

Question: What's your favorite way to eat?


Ferris: I'm so lucky in my diet because I don't have any cravings and I always feel full. But when I want something sweet or savory, there's nothing that I can eat that won't make me feel full too. When I was growing up, when we had lunch, we would each get a piece of bread and cheese with peanut butter on it. We'd call it a sandwich. If you went out for French fries every day, by the end of high school you were eating a pound of fries every single day. I know what it feels like to eat things that aren't good for you and then think it doesn't matter because it's just one of those ""Oh yeah, well at least I ate"" kind of things.

Ferris: I wouldn't go back to college. That's where I learned how to be an entrepreneur: building a business from scratch and getting it off the ground. After I graduated, I didn't know what else to do and I thought that maybe entrepreneurship wasn't for me.

Q: swelling of fingers and toes (especially thumb) in the first week after a fever. (answer given by doctor, October 2003)

A: I believe this is probably due to an increase in lymphatic flow from a virus or bacterial infection. The problem can be treated with antibiotics if it persists for more than two weeks.

Hands and Feet

Q: My right hand hurts all over, not just on the ends. It's hard to open a bottle. How long should I wait before going to the Doctor?

A: This condition is often caused by either inflammation in the area or an infection. If you have been experiencing these symptoms for over two weeks they may indicate that your body is fighting an internal enemy - most likely a fungus. It is important not to go to see the doctor until you've had four consecutive days without any pain. You should also get some rest as well as eating a healthy diet and getting plenty of fluids. Once the soreness goes away the doctor will be able to determine what was wrong. There are several different types of fungi. One type causes sores, another produces pus-filled swellings called boils. Often both types affect the same part of the body. Some people are prone to one disease while others are susceptible to many. It has been found that the incidence of finger infections tends to rise with age so older individuals tend to have higher rates. Other factors that contribute to increased risk include being overweight or having certain lifestyle habits like smoking tobacco or alcohol use.

Tears or Blisters

Q: When does a blister form under my fingernails? Is there anything that can help prevent them from forming?

A: A blister forms when microscopic bacteria (viruses) enter a tissue cell through a puncture site. They travel along the inner surface of skin cells and attach themselves to nearby blood vessels. As the blood vessel wall thickens the capillaries become blocked, causing a ""bleeding"" sensation. This process occurs rapidly, creating an air pocket around the blister which creates an environment conducive for infection.

The best way to avoid blisters developing is to keep your nails trimmed short. Frequent washing will keep them smooth and free from infection. To reduce the risk of a blister forming you should cut down your intake of salt.

It is best to seek immediate medical attention if a blister develops, or if it keeps opening up again within 24 hours. If it becomes infected, treatment consists of antibiotic",121,numb fingers arthritis,-12.791509628295898,156,question,3,0.8764044943820225,422,1

Q: What are your symptoms?

A: Dry, cracked skin (almost always red) which gets extremely dry, cracking and peeling off the skin from my hands, feet, neck and back, sometimes my face as well. The skin on the palms of my hand is usually particularly dry. There also seems to be a thickening of the skin around the area where it cracks and peels off. It can sometimes feel tight in places like my elbows or wrists but not so much that it would be painful if it was pulled. Also often, it feels heavy on my chest and shoulders. Occasionally, I get rash around the site where the skin breaks away. Occasionally I break out like crazy. My hair is also frequently thinning due to my acne and sometimes when the skin rashes. Sometimes my face and neck hurt too. But my facial wrinkles don't seem to go away because they're constantly breaking up again. I have very dark circles under my eyes. If you look closely at me, you'll notice that my skin has small bumps all over it. They're not pimples though - they're just little white dots. And sometimes they come in clumps so thickly they become pretty obvious.

There's no cure for my skin problems!

I'm working hard now trying to reduce the amount of stress/stress hormones that cause them, and hopefully get past them. Unfortunately, it takes some time, and I am still getting them occasionally. As soon as I do get rid of them completely, then I will probably start using skincare products that work better for me because they aren't linked to hormonal issues. In the meantime, I keep applying a lot of moisturizer and anti-aging serums, as well as anti-bacterial creams like Neutrogena Gentle Blackhead Power Liquid, for a few days after a major flare-up.

When you don't get enough sleep (or if you're a night owl), this can also happen as well.

If you have MS, it's likely that you'll need some form of treatment for your condition at one point or another over your lifetime. However, there are several ways to manage MS-related problems so you can continue working, live as normally as possible, and get compensated appropriately during this time.

How is Multiple Sclerosis Treated?\nAnswer: The treatment options available vary depending on your diagnosis. Depending on your level of disability, you may receive either corticosteroid therapy (such as prednisone), an injectable drug (for example, prednisolone injection) or a combination of both. Your doctor will discuss these treatments with you and decide what works best for you. In addition to your medical care, you'll want to make sure you're taking medicines properly—both for treating MS itself, as well as for managing its symptoms. For more information about the treatment you might receive, see How is Multiple Sclerosis Treated?

What if I'm not able to pay for treatment?

Some people with MS who don't qualify for special Medicare insurance because they aren't disabled are forced into government assistance programs such as Medicaid. These programs allow them to stay at home, receive help getting jobs, and find food to eat while receiving treatment. While it isn't guaranteed that you'll qualify for Medicaid, there are steps you can take to prepare yourself for this possibility.

How do I apply for Medicaid?

If you can't afford to pay for MS treatment out-of-pocket, you may be eligible for Medicaid. You must contact your state's health department to find out whether or not your state participates in Medicaid. To find out more about how to apply for Medicaid, visit Medi-Cal.gov. Or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-622-4357). Also ask your doctor about other options you may consider, such as paying for services through a private provider.

gpt2-xl_59,"the risk of MS increases with age, which is why it's important to start therapy early. The likelihood of progression depends on how long you have had it and when it started; if you don't begin treatment at an early stage, your chances are higher of a relapse or worse outcome.The chance that a person will develop MS does not increase over time. Even people who have had their first MS attack before they're 50 are still at high risk of developing the disease later in life.

Q: What happens to my body during treatment?Answer: the main goal of treatment is to prevent symptoms by suppressing nerve cells so that they can no longer produce enough inflammatory chemicals that cause inflammation and damage. In some cases, this may involve drugs called anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). NSAID medications work by reducing the amount of a certain type of protein produced by nerve cells called cyclooxygenase enzymes. Cytokines also help explain what appears to be a common side effect: stomach problems in many patients taking NSAIDS.

Q: Are there any other risks associated with treating MS? Answer: Yes, even in patients who don't develop severe disability from MS, side effects such as heart problems and stroke, and blood clots may occur. These can be serious, but they're generally mild and self-limiting.

Q: How much do I need to take each day for the best results? Answer: There isn't one dose, but doctors usually recommend starting treatment with either low doses of 400 mg of ibuprofen (Advil) every four hours for two days to see whether the medicines' benefits last or not. If they don't, it's probably safe to continue taking lower doses until your doctor tells you otherwise. You'll use the same amount of medication all throughout the course of treatment — sometimes less, sometimes more. It may take several weeks to find out exactly how much to take — and then adjust your regimen accordingly. Your doctor will discuss how often to change up the dosages, since different people respond differently to these treatments.

Q: Should I stop taking the pills?Answer: It's unlikely you'll get better without stopping treatment, especially since your immune system doesn't naturally make its own medicine like yours does. That said, there's always the possibility that the medicines might interfere with a future autoimmune reaction, or your body could go into remission once you've been treated. So keep trying, even after you stop taking them.",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-0.7272793650627136,13,question,3,0.06372549019607843,407,2
gpt2-xl_54,"Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system. It involves damage to certain cells in the brain and spinal cord (nerve tissue). Damage occurs when an immune cell called T-cells attack and destroy these nerve cells. The main symptom of MS is weakness or paralysis of one part of your body. You may have symptoms of tingling, numbness, burning pain, a rapid heartbeat, problems with vision, balance, speech, or swallowing. Other symptoms can be related to another condition, such as diabetes.


\r Answer: Your doctor will first do a neurological exam to determine whether you have MS. This includes looking for signs of disease on physical exams and asking about your medical history. If you have a family history of MS or other health conditions that might cause symptoms, your doctor will ask you additional questions. For example, if your doctor finds a rash on your neck while doing an examination, he or she will check for MS in order to rule out the possibility that you have the disorder.


\r Answer: A neurologist performs tests that are used to diagnose MS. These tests examine your nerves to see how they work normally, and then the doctors compare your results to those of people who don't have MS. In some cases, your neurologist may try to identify which parts of your central nervous system are affected by MS. For example, your physician may do CT scans to look at your spinal cords. Also, your doctor may use imaging procedures, like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to study areas of the brain involved with learning and memory. In addition, your doctor may perform blood tests to look for changes in immune function during the course of MS, such as markers called C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). These levels fluctuate throughout the year. Tests that measure CRP can show whether the immune system has been weakened, leading to inflammation and possibly neurological problems. IL-6 helps regulate how the immune system responds to bacteria. An elevated level indicates increased bacterial activity in the body.


\r Answer: Many medications can help relieve symptoms of MS. Medications that treat fatigue and muscle stiffness could improve coordination. Some types of corticosteroids reduce the severity of symptoms. Certain antiepileptic drugs can make it easier for your brain's neurons to communicate with each other. Antipsychotic drugs also can ease symptoms associated with anxiety and panic attacks. Other medications can decrease the amount of swelling in your legs that can occur",54,What does multiple sclerosis diagnosis include?

If you have not been taking an antidepressant at all, then try to keep your dose as low as possible. It takes about 8 weeks to get a response from an antidepressant, but it may be worth trying again if you don't see results in the first few sessions. As far as the severity of depression goes, the best course of action is to start with lower doses and work up gradually (a little every week or two). For those who are very depressed, there is no evidence-based guideline on how much to take at any one time; however, it seems safe to say that the usual recommended daily dosage is 1 mg per kg body weight.

It should also be noted that there is some evidence suggesting that long-term use of SSRIs can induce hypomania in certain cases - this does not seem likely to occur with antidepressants other than SSRIs. Anecdotally, I've heard reports of people taking antidepressants for years before developing hypomanic episodes. This tends to happen more commonly among people who had a history of mania prior to their SSRI prescription. This effect has not yet been scientifically studied; so while it's certainly something to consider, we still do not know whether it occurs more frequently in people with bipolar disorder.

The main reasons why someone would want to stop using a psychotropic drug include anxiety, insomnia, decreased sex drive and/or libido and nausea (this last one doesn't apply to all SSRIs). These will usually improve quickly without stopping the medication. If you experience these problems when you are starting out with antidepressants, it could be worth asking your doctor what sort of support he or she provides to people struggling with depression. Also, the risk of suicide and self harm increases dramatically if a person is depressed - especially once the suicidal thoughts start occurring. In addition to feeling more depressed, your ability to feel enjoyment and pleasure in life may decrease greatly (there is a good chance that depression itself might make you less likely to engage in pleasurable activities, though there's no definitive proof that either are directly caused by depression). There are various treatments available, such as cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness meditation, which help in reducing your depressive symptoms and preventing relapse into depression. Your doctor can guide you towards the right ones for you.

Some common side effects of antidepressants include constipation, dry mouth and fatigue. Long term use may lead to osteoporosis, although studies have shown that this",114,borderline personality disorder symptoms,-12.507143020629885,98,question,3,0.9074074074074074,431,1

Q: When a child has had an episode of MS, how long does it take them to get better?

A: Generally this will depend on their age and level at diagnosis. A child with the most severe form may not improve for months or years.

At the time of diagnosis, children have a 50% chance of being able to return to full activity before they are 5-6 years old. At that point, their odds start to decrease again. In other words, if you've given your child MS medicines over the last 12 weeks or so (the recommended course), then your child is likely to be in remission by 3 years of age.

If you're unsure about whether a child can safely continue using medicine to treat MS, talk to their doctor.

Children who started treatment too late may benefit from some type of therapy, such as an immunotherapy drug, while others may need surgery to remove part or all of their brain stem.

Children's reactions to treatments

When you give medicine to a young patient, there's still often concern about side effects. Here we explain what's known about specific problems:

Adverse events of the first generation

There were two major types of adverse events reported in studies of first-generation drugs. These included allergic reactions – which could include swelling or hives – as well as psychiatric symptoms.

There was also increased risk for seizures, including those caused by epilepsy. The latter condition affects approximately 1 in every 2 million people.

The main cause of these risks is likely due to a chemical reaction between the first-generation medicines and the immune system. However, more research is needed into the causes of seizure disorders.

Another important problem was the possibility of serious heart damage and stroke. This occurred when some patients developed strokes after taking the anti-seizure medication carbamazepine. It is unclear why this happened, but it did happen.

In contrast to first-generation medicines, second generation medicines now used today are far safer than those originally approved and are usually safe even without any side effects. Still, they carry a higher risk of side effects, especially serious ones.

What are the new products?

Fluctuations in thyroid function

Frequency of thyroid activity, measured by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), may be less than the usual range. Symptoms include fatigue or weakness, depression, and weight gain. Hypothyroidism can also cause bone loss, making you more vulnerable to osteoporosis later in life. [7]

Hypothyroidism can be caused by a number of factors, including environmental exposure, infection with certain bacteria, drugs used for medical treatment, pregnancy, medications, aging, and genetic mutations.[8]

Symptoms that may indicate an underlying problem are not always present, but they could increase your risk for developing hypothyroidism. They might include:

Fatigue or sleepiness

Decreased energy levels

Headaches

Tremors

Mood swings

Constipation

Abnormal thyroid hormone production

Severe hyperthyroidism is associated with serious complications such as heart failure or stroke. In fact, the United States Center for Disease Control estimates that up to 80 percent of adults over 65 years old have some degree of subclinical hypothyroidism.

If you have MS and are an adult or teenager, it is not too late to start taking medicines that help control symptoms (at least for 2-3 years). A doctor should prescribe you medicine when he or she thinks you may benefit from treatment.

When you're young, you may need fewer medicines to get the same effect as someone who has had more severe symptoms before starting treatment. But keep in mind that many medications can cause serious side effects, so talk with your doctor about which one is right for you. If there are risks associated with a particular drug, do not take it until you've talked with your doctor first. Some drugs may increase the risk of developing another condition called Alzheimer's disease, especially those that affect your central nervous system. Talk to your doctor about what is safe for you, including whether you should use certain medicines together while you're on other medicines.

If you already know how well you respond to certain treatments, continue them even though they might be causing problems. Doctors often give people with MS new drugs at different times during their illness. That way, the body learns what kind of effect each medication will have, and then it adapts to those effects. In addition, doctors sometimes change medications because of side effects, so it's important that you check with your doctor regularly.

Even if you're able to tolerate some medicines, you shouldn't stop all of them. For example, you'll probably still need painkillers and others may only make your symptoms worse. It is also essential that you eat nutritious food and avoid caffeine and alcohol. Finally, remember that just because you seem better now doesn't mean the problem won't come back.

Q. How do I keep my glasses clean? A. Take them off often; let them get dirty and then throw them out! (see question #7)


Question: Why should I avoid contact lenses with a coating of any kind? A. This is because many manufacturers have tried to market their contacts as being non-allergenic. Contact lens makers want you to wear their product to prevent contact allergy outbreaks! See the answer in the previous question for a more detailed explanation.


Question: What do you mean by ""contact lens"" and ""glasses?"" A. As used here in this website, contact lenses are eyeglasses that cover your eye's surface to ensure proper vision; contact lenses usually have no lens covering (though some may be coated).

Glasses are worn on top of contact lenses or over them. They provide additional protection from harmful radiation from solar energy but they don't cover the entire eyes. If you put contacts and/or glasses on while swimming, diving, flying etc., you'll need to apply sunscreen after coming up for air.

Question: What kind of sunglasses can protect my eyes from UV rays, e.g. from sun lamps?


A. UVB rays range between 330 nm to 400 nm, which means that at the shortest wavelengths they can reach skin directly, without getting through the atmosphere, and at the longest wavelengths they can penetrate into the cornea of the eye. The amount of exposure depends upon the length of time the light is present – longer exposures result in more damage. Sunlight causes all kinds of photochemical reactions within the body, including production of free radicals, changes in membrane permeability, formation of reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, and even inflammation. If enough UVB is given over a prolonged period of time, it can cause corneal ulceration, keratitis, cataracts, etc. But not only is UVB damaging to your eyes, it also damages your skin. UV rays can burn your eyes, so we recommend you wear sunglasses made specifically to block ultraviolet light. For details on sunglasses you can consult the LensSafe website.

In contrast to the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes in the general population, there are marked differences between individuals who have been diagnosed with the disease compared with those who do not (Hendrickson, 2007). In addition to risk factors already mentioned, a history of smoking may increase your chance of developing the condition (Perez et al., 2004).

As a result of these factors, many people develop Type 2 diabetes during their lifetime.

The incidence of MS increases significantly as one gets older in different regions of Europe. For example, during 1990-1997, the rate of MS among people aged 35 to 39 years increased from 14.7 per 100,000 persons in 1990 to 24.4 per 100,000 persons in 1997. During 1998-2007, the increase was even more pronounced: from 19.0 per 100,000 persons in 1999 to 34.9 per 100,000 persons in 2007. These figures for men and women have been derived according to the population structure in the same country (see Figure 3).

In countries such as Austria, Germany, and Italy, the prevalence of MS has remained relatively stable at around 8%. But in the United Kingdom and Ireland, a significant number of people with MS are beginning to show signs of the disease while still young and healthy.

gpt2-xl_93,"Yes. Multiple sclerosis can be caused by many things including sleep deprivation, poor diet, obesity, radiation, infection, chemotherapy drugs or other diseases and medications, and stress. Most of these things are often not recognized as contributing factors because they do not cause the disease symptoms but may affect a person's ability to function effectively at home and/or work. \ n

Sleep apnea is one such condition that can lead to multiple sclerosis. The main symptom of this type of sleep disorder is shortness of breath while sleeping. Other possible sleep disorders include restless leg syndrome (RLS), sleepwalking, and sleep-related seizures. Some studies indicate that up to 40% of patients with multiple sclerosis have some form of sleep disorder. \n

The most common reasons for daytime sleepiness include depression, anxiety, exhaustion, and poor quality eating habits such as skipping meals and overeating. In addition, medications like antidepressants and benzodiazepines that cause drowsiness also occur frequently among patients with MS. A number of medications used to treat MS also interfere with sleep. These include immunosuppressive drugs for leukemia, tuberculosis, HIV, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma; antihistamines, antipsychotics, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, blood pressure lowering agents, corticosteroids, antibiotics, immune boosters, and anesthetic drugs. Sleep medication use has been linked to more serious complications such as infections and stroke than nonmedicated treatment. \ n

It is important to understand that some types of sleep disorders such as insomnia are normal for the majority of the population even if they occur rarely. However, there are those who experience persistent or recurrent sleeplessness that cannot be relieved by taking prescription medications, which is considered a chronic illness. It also must be noted that certain forms of MS can make it difficult to fall asleep due to muscle weakness, fatigue, loss of coordination, nausea, vomiting, headaches, dizziness, and confusion. Many of these conditions are exacerbated when a patient remains awake during the night with only light levels being low enough to awaken them from sleep. For these individuals, using alcohol or stimulating substances before bedtime may help them fall asleep faster so that they can recover from their sleep disturbance. In any case, it is better to remain in your own comfort zone to avoid potential trouble during sleep cycles. \ n

The long answer is this:

It's not known whether this particular product is harmful or does more harm than good; it can't be known because its safety has never been studied and there have not been any clinical trials conducted to determine if the vaccination will help reduce disability in MS patients, as promised by the manufacturer of Covid-19. But what we do know is that even a small risk may be too great to take any chances with another person's health when it comes to vaccines.

Vaccination rates are dropping for a number of reasons, including parents' concerns about autism, fear of side effects from certain kinds of diseases, increased concern over side effects from vaccines, and even some religious objections. In other words, many children don't want to get the shots they're supposed to get. That means fewer kids are getting them, which means there'll be less protection against disease. This makes sense, but not much sense if you believe that vaccines are safe. After all, anyone who has taken any kind of medical treatment knows that it's best to err on the side of caution and avoid doing anything that might cause injury or illness. By contrast, those who subscribe to the anti-vaccine movement think that vaccines aren't necessary—and that doctors are simply afraid to administer them in order to push their own personal agendas, such as promoting childhood immunization programs (which they consider dangerous) or even the belief that vaccines caused the 9/11 attacks (which they regard as unproven).

In fact, since 2004, there has not been one case of a vaccine causing death among 10 million people worldwide vaccinated with DTaP, DTP, Hib, IPV, MMR, varicella, meningococcal conjugate vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine, tetanus toxoid, PCV7, or polio. There were three cases reported after each of these events, so those are the ones most commonly mentioned as causes of death in those reporting deaths following the vaccination, though it's likely that others contributed in small numbers.

So yes, as stated above, the antivaccine movement has pushed vaccines off the public agenda. Unfortunately, it appears to have succeeded.

One reason why there haven't been more deaths linked to vaccinations is that those who had died did not get vaccinated while alive and thus didn't receive that protection. Another reason is that it's very difficult to ascertain if someone was actually harmed by a vaccine. For example, the CDC",72,Is the Covid-19 vaccine safe for people taking multiple sclerosis drugs?,-0.0145596908405423,20,question,3,0.09389671361502347,405,24

You may also be able to get certain drugs called second generation immunosuppressants, which are approved for use by most insurance companies. If you are taking second generation immunosuppressants at the same time as you have MS, or if your doctor tells you to take them while treating MS, they will only work when taken together. The medications used to treat MS do not prevent the development of all forms of cancer in humans, so you should talk with your healthcare professional about any health problems related to having MS.

Q: How much money am I entitled to receive from my insurance company after I start treatment? \nA: This depends on where you live and what type of coverage you have. Generally speaking, if you have coverage through your employer (but not if you're self-employed) you will need to pay out-of-pocket costs of $1,000/month before you begin receiving any benefit payments. For example, if you make $25,000 per year, then you would spend 50% of your salary on treatment every month. Some people with high incomes choose to ""co-pay"" their insurance premiums because of how much extra money they save each month compared to paying full price. However, this amount isn't always consistent across states, so check your state's website for more information. You can find details on what your insurer covers at www.medicaid.gov.

Q: What kind of tests are done to diagnose MS?\nA: A number of laboratory tests are required to rule out other conditions that may cause symptoms similar to those seen with MS. These include: blood tests to screen for infections; liver function test to look for fatty deposits; and urinalysis to look for excess fluid retention. Once these tests show no abnormalities, you'll receive a diagnosis of MS. But there are also many other lab tests that can help determine if someone has MS and can tell us if you already have it. Your physician might order one of the following tests: An electrocardiogram to monitor heart function; an MRI to examine the brain; a bone marrow biopsy to see if you have inherited any mutations that may increase the risk of developing MS; a colonoscopy to check for diseases causing ulcers in the digestive tract; and a CT scan to look for tumors in the",79,Can I pass multiple sclerosis to other family members?,-8.653287887573242,134,question,3,0.5851528384279476,413,27

Medical Journal of Australia (May 1992) Vol. 161 No. 3 pp. 687-693

Abstract:

Introduction

Possible connection between prostate cancer and low levels of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

Method

Case series review of eight patients with clinically localized disease and prostate biopsy findings suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), six with diagnosed high-grade prostatitis (HP), two with hormone-receptor negative prostate cancer (NRPC) and one with suspected acute myeloid leukemia.

Results

Six had normal PSA levels, three had mildly elevated PSA levels (>1 ng/ml), two had very high levels (<2 ng/ml) and none were BPH or NRPC.

Discussion

None of the cases of prostate cancer was definitively attributed to low levels of PSAs in the serum. None of them had symptoms consistent with BPH or NRPC. Only one had an abnormal PSA level but it was below the upper limit considered indicative of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Conclusion

In conclusion there is no convincing evidence that prostate cancer has a significant relationship with low levels of the PSA test.",116,outcome prostate cancer,-9.40187168121338,106,question,3,0.4274193548387097,195,10

Q. What are the symptoms of MS?\r

A. Symptoms include numbness and tingling in one or both legs, blurred vision, problems with balance, problems walking, loss of voice and speech (hypersensitivity pneumonitis), vision changes, stiffness, pain in joints (arthritis) or muscles (spondyloarthropathy), muscle weakness, fatigue, sleep difficulties, skin conditions, hearing problems (peripheral neuropathy) and tremors.

Q. How is MS diagnosed?\r

A. There have been a number of different ways to diagnose MS. In recent years there has been much interest in using new MRI techniques, which can look at patterns of inflammation and damage in the brain. However this technology has not yet been widely used in England.

Q. Is there a cure for MS?\r

A. Not likely to be. Current treatments aim to manage symptoms. People who may benefit from treatment include people with type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus, those taking aspirin, certain groups of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, women with breast cancer, people with HIV infection, and people with multiple sclerosis.",58,Risk to develop multiple sclerosis,-9.84298610687256,81,question,3,0.35064935064935066,165,4

gpt2-xl_130,"This is a question that I've had many times. The answer to this one should be simple, but there are some good reasons why stretching the neck and shoulder muscles can't hurt you.

Stretching the neck and shoulder muscles may seem to help in a few areas, but it won't hurt at all.

In fact, it will actually improve your strength and endurance. It's like a muscle exercise for your neck and shoulders, which means it gives you great health benefits because of its muscular strengthening effect on your muscles.

A study conducted by researchers at Michigan State University showed that those people who did these exercises were able to perform more repetitions with less rest time than their untrained peers.

This kind of training could be useful to anyone. If you want to lose weight or improve muscle tone and flexibility, then you're going to need some kind of resistance training.

However, if you just do any old stretching routine without any sort of exercise you risk injury from overuse and poor technique. So before you stretch try some easy moves first.

Some basic stretches are listed below.

Stage 4 metastasis is defined as the presence of a nodal mass or adenocarcinoma that has spread to distant areas in either the upper thoracic cavity or lung. These tumors are found at the time of diagnosis (stage 1) and continue to grow for up to 5 years after diagnosis (stage 2). They then go into remission, but may return later if not treated with radiation therapy. This type of disease usually occurs when cells become resistant to chemotherapy, even at lower doses. The risk of developing this disease increases significantly as people age because they are more likely than younger patients to develop resistance.

When to see your doctor?

If you have had some symptoms, such as coughing or difficulty breathing, or if you've noticed changes in your health during the past year, contact your doctor right away if you notice any problems with your lungs that might be related to lung cancer. For instance, some cancers can affect other organs, such as the bones, liver or kidneys. A doctor should also check to make sure you don't have other conditions that could cause similar symptoms.

How will I know my condition has advanced?

Your doctor will probably begin to treat your lung cancer by doing tests to find out how far along it is. Some doctors use X-rays to measure the size and shape of your lung tissue. If your cancer has grown so much that a needle is inserted through the skin into your chest wall, you'll need to get an x-ray of your lungs every few months until your condition improves. You may receive a CT scan or MRI scans to look at your lungs' structure and function.

The side effects of the medicine are very minor. The most common side effect is constipation, which can be reduced by drinking more fluids. There's also the possibility that a person could develop other side effects after stopping the medication. If you notice any changes in your symptoms or side effects, contact your doctor. You will need to see a specialist for this.

Treatment

Your doctor may prescribe another type of anti-viral medication called a ritonavir (also known as famciclovir). It doesn't have the same long term side effects and is much less likely to cause serious side effects. This is because ritonavir works to kill viruses (viruses don't last long when they're active) rather than changing how cells work. Ritonavir reduces levels of virus in the blood so that there is no longer a virus left at a time when people should be infected with viruses.

In some cases, your doctor might recommend a single dose of ritonavir if you haven't been taking it for 7 days. In other cases, you might need 3 doses of ritonavir over 4 weeks.

Q: what should I eat if you are on a low carb or ketogenic diet? Answer: eat more fruits and vegetables.

Paleo Diet Basics – What is Paleo Diet?

What is Paleo (or Primal) for You?

The Paleo diet is an ancient, ancestral diet that evolved out of our hunter-gatherer past where we were nomadic tribes living in small groups of family, friends, or neighbors who shared our food source with one another, as well as our hunting practices. The Paleo diet is based around eating real foods that came from nature, and avoiding processed junk foods like sugary cereals, soda, fast food, etc., which are not natural to us. It was created by Loren Cordain (author of ""Diet Revolution"" and ""The Paleo Solution"") and it provides health benefits for your body.

In his book ""Diet Revolution"", Dr. Cordain states that ""the Paleolithic diet is defined as a nutrient dense, plant-based diet that favors whole grains, fresh fruit, nuts, seeds, vegetables, legumes, dairy products and fish.""

This definition may seem pretty vague at first glance but take into account the fact that there has been no progress towards understanding why humans ate different things prior to the industrial revolution. Before the invention of agriculture, animals had not developed the ability to store fat and therefore did not have access to this important resource. Humans began farming after they became self sufficient and thus developed the ability to obtain their primary energy sources through animal meat instead of relying solely on plants. We then proceeded down the path of processing and refining these resources so that they could be easily consumed by human beings. Our ancestors lived in the same environment as those who lived before them, yet their dietary choices were far different and in many ways made sense.

To understand how to make good dietary choices today, we need to consider what our ancestors ate, as well as compare it to modern day nutrition standards that dictate what we can consume without causing harm. Here's a brief rundown of some key points about this amazing diet plan.

Benefits of The Paleo Diet

gpt2-xl_108,"Treatment of diarrhea is difficult. Common treatments include antibiotics, antacids and oral rehydration solutions. The most effective treatment of diarrhea in patients with a history of constipation or frequent diarrhea is the use of fiber supplements. Fiber supplements are available both as tablet preparations and liquid beverages that can be taken by mouth; this is particularly important when treating children younger than 5 years old because they may not have full control over their bowel movements. Fructooligosaccharides are commonly used. If diarrhea continues for more than 3 days, a fecal incontinence device (FID) should be considered. A FID is an external anal sphincter device that attaches at the rectum to absorb stool into the anus. It works by pushing the stool down through the sphincters instead of up. This allows the patient to defecate without having to sit on it. FIDs usually last from 4 to 6 hours, but some patients may require longer periods. Some people who cannot tolerate FIDs will need to undergo a colonoscopy. Anorectal decompression surgery (ADCS), also called ""rectocele removal,"" is another option for those suffering from constipation. ADCS involves removing one or more of the segments of the rectocele. After ADCS, there is no need to change laxatives because the rectocele regrows and is filled with small intestine. Rectoceles should never be surgically removed because they cause permanent damage to the nerves that control bowel function. It may take several months after a successful ADCS for all of the residual tissue to disappear. The result is that a person's ability to pass stools normally returns. When ADCS is unsuccessful, a doctor may prescribe a variety of medications such as anti-diarrhea pills, dietitian counseling, and laxative suppositories. Because constipation is often associated with other symptoms, such as poor digestion, malabsorption problems, or fatigue, dietitians often recommend a multivitamin supplement along with the constipating food and/or medication. These medications often help improve quality of life and reduce stress levels. Many people believe that eating spicy foods helps constipation. However, research shows that spicy foods do not increase the risk of developing diarrhea. Although there is some evidence that spicy foods might lower blood pressure, the effect on constipation has been inconclusive.

""The number one reason that people with type 1 diabetes don't respond to insulin is that they don't produce enough insulin,"" says Dr. Paul Offit, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at Children's Hospital Boston. \r

\r

In fact, if you have insulin resistance, your body has no way of sensing when there's an insulin shortage (and therefore no way to increase production). ""So when you're in a state of obesity or diabetes that doesn't improve even though you diet and exercise, then there are other underlying issues that need to be addressed."" Insulin resistance can occur in two different ways:\u2014either because the pancreas produces too little insulin or because the cells inside the pancreas lack sufficient receptors for insulin. Both factors make diabetics more likely to develop complications such as heart disease and kidney failure. The key to reversing these complications is increasing levels of insulin. To do this, you must either increase the amount of insulin produced by your liver, kidneys, muscles, or both. This requires a continual supply of insulin from your bloodstream, so you'll need to keep taking it. You also need to watch out for sugar cravings caused by carbohydrate-rich foods and beverages. If you crave sweets after meals or snacks, it may indicate you've got too much fat stored on your stomach. To avoid diabetes complications, always eat plenty of fiber, fruits and vegetables, and lean protein. And if you're overweight or obese, make sure you're not consuming more than the recommended daily calorie intake. \r

You feel lightheaded;

Your blood pressure drops suddenly; or

You experience severe pain in your arm or leg. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis can lead to coma and death. When your kidneys fail to properly filter acid produced by the urine, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being excreted. As the level of glucose in the blood rises, the brain raises its own insulin levels to maintain normal fluid balance. Eventually the process becomes harmful; if not treated promptly, it can result in permanent damage to the delicate tissues lining the inner walls of your eyes, the membranes of your mouth and nose, and even the lining of your lungs.

This video will show you what you can expect from the CBT with your chronic headache. It should help you understand the basics of what it's like being sick and helps make your head hurt less.

Why do I need CBT with my Chronic Headache? What are its Benefits?

The most important thing you want to know when starting CBT is, why does it work so well? The answers to these questions can have a huge impact on how long it takes for you to feel better. In this video we'll share some tips about the advantages of CBT to get relief quickly. We've also included a great chart that illustrates what happens during CBT sessions and how they affect your headaches in just 5 minutes or less.

Does CBT Really Work?

So, you're wondering if it really works and can help you beat those bad head aches. While there isn't any research on the effectiveness of CBT (which is pretty rare), the evidence suggests that it does work. Many studies suggest that CBT is effective at reducing symptoms of acute migraine, tension-type headache, cluster headaches, migraines due to anxiety, and other types of chronic pain as shown here in a review by Fournier et al.

How Much Does CBT Cost?

The cost depends on how much you want to spend but typically costs between $100-$200 per session depending on what kind of treatment you choose. And remember – all your money goes toward helping yourself, not hurting others! The average price for one therapy session ranges from around $30-$60 which is quite reasonable considering the potential benefits of CBT for pain, sleep, and mood.

Can You Do CBT Yourself?


Yes, you CAN! There are numerous websites out there offering online courses teaching people how to do CBT so you don't have to pay thousands of dollars for someone else's class. Here are two examples of free CBT courses available online:

Your partner(s) must complete an informed consent form which includes questions about your medical history and current or past use of oral contraceptives (OC), whether you have ever been diagnosed with cancer, heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or other health conditions affecting fertility, as well as any allergies you may be having. If possible, your partners should also complete a questionnaire asking how long they've had sex in the past 6 months, their age at first intercourse, how frequently they have sex during the previous year and, if applicable, what type of condom or barrier method they currently use. Please note that when answering this survey you are not required to disclose all information about your sexual history or current reproductive status; however, it is recommended that you do so for the purposes of obtaining accurate answers. This survey is completely voluntary; no one can force you to take part. The results of this study will only be made available to your doctor after completion of the interview. In addition, we want to ensure that our participants understand that the decision to participate in these studies and to receive clinical treatments depends on them participating fully and honestly. Participants who decline participation due to concerns regarding confidentiality could still participate in future studies, but they would need to contact us directly to discuss additional information pertaining to the study.

1.3 How many days and hours before the procedure should I stay home? Can I stop working or school to rest up and prepare for the procedure?

The duration of your recovery period from the procedure depends on several factors, including your body's ability to handle the medication and time since last dose. You should start the process of healing immediately after your treatment session to avoid potential complications such as infection, bleeding, bruising, discomfort, nausea, or vomiting. Most people heal within 4-8 weeks without incident. However, depending on your medical condition, your recovery time may vary significantly from this timeframe. It is important that you consult your physician prior to initiating any medication to determine the safest dosage for yourself to minimize the risk of side effects.

It is also known as ""sensory overload syndrome"" or ""neurological sensitization."" The main symptom of MS is numbness in the extremities (limb paralysis). However, there are many other symptoms such as weakness on one side of the body, severe fatigue, mental confusion, and problems with memory, speech and vision.

To date no cure for MS has been discovered, but there are treatments. One of the most effective methods is called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, which involves applying intense electrical current through electrodes placed on the head to reduce inflammation in parts of the brain involved in motor control. For those who have had enough from repeated treatment, the procedure can be reversed so they don't need it again. Although this therapy does not work every time, it is an option for some people who would otherwise die without it. This program may take months, but usually results in significant improvement in MS symptoms within three months. In fact, nearly 100% of patients seen during the first year of the study went into remission after going through the intervention.

Unfortunately, many people who experience long-term remission do not recover completely from their initial stages of the disease. Some continue to suffer from these relapses even after being treated. Therefore, researchers at Harvard Medical School recently decided to see if they could identify how people recover after a full course of the RTSS. They found that the risk of getting relapsing remitting MS was much higher among the group that completed only one year of treatment than among those who finished two years and a half of treatment. These findings are promising because they suggest that longer courses of treatment could help people return to normality sooner.

Q: What is the difference between: breast cancer and other types of colorectal neoplasms?A: There are two main kinds of colorectal cancers: primary (non-melanoma) and metastatic. Primary tumors arise from a person's own cells. They do not usually spread to nearby tissue, including distant lymph nodes or organs such as the liver or lungs.Mastectomy for these tumors reduces their ability to grow quickly enough to affect the surrounding organs, causing death within several months.Mastectomies often must be performed before cancer can spread, which typically occurs at least six months after surgery. Secondary tumors may occur in people who have had only one tumor removed.Colonoscopy uses light microscopes to look inside the colon. The operation involves passing small instruments through the rectum to examine the lining of the colon. Colonic polyps, benign growths that appear as bumps on the surface of the bowel, can cause symptoms similar to those caused by cancer. These benign growths can also lead to serious complications if they reach larger areas of your body, especially in older patients.Treatments for these conditions include radiation therapy and chemotherapy.Radiation therapy used to treat colorectal cancer produces high doses of radiation that target both normal and abnormal cells throughout the colon and large intestine. Antineoplastons, such as Aricept (mepacitinib), are sometimes given along with radiotherapy to help fight cancerous growths. Chemotherapy medications may be used too. In addition, some studies suggest that colon cancer may respond better to immune system therapies such as stem cells than chemotherapy alone.Some patients experience side effects while undergoing surgery to remove part of their colon, called a ""transversus"" procedure.

The first year after diagnosis usually costs $25,000-$30,000 per year for an individual. Depending on your insurance coverage, this can range anywhere from $15,000-$20,000 per year. If you don't qualify for financial aid, you may need to borrow money yourself. Your treatment plan will include a pre-treatment evaluation where you'll be evaluated as well as regular followup visits throughout the course of your treatment. It's important to remember that you must continue to see your doctor if you have any problems while completing your treatment plan. However, there are many resources available to help you find out more about MS care options.

Q: Are there any other things I should know before starting my MS treatment?\


A: For most people, the first month of treating MS isn't particularly difficult. But over the next several months you will experience the following changes: loss of feeling in hands and feet, muscle spasms and weakness, memory problems, difficulty speaking, difficulties with movement and balance, confusion, fatigue, vision problems, and mood swings. These changes are often accompanied by other symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, fatigue, shortness of breath, weakness, numbness, and sensitivity to light. Some people report having more than one symptom during the course of treatment; others have only mild, intermittent symptoms.

gpt2-xl_77,"Menopause causes a shift in the balance of estrogen, which helps maintain regular menstrual cycles. This imbalance leads to a drop in progesterone (a hormone that regulates the body's natural production of estrogen and progesterone), which is then released into the blood during menstruation as a result of the fall in estrogen levels. This excess estrogen promotes inflammation of skin cells due to the increase in free radicals created by it.

Menstrual dysfunction can also contribute to inflammatory lesions such as nodules (fluid-filled cysts) on skin, eyes or joints. When these fluid filled cysts rupture, they become inflamed and painful, which may lead to eye or joint infections. The inflammation can cause scarring resulting in reduced mobility of affected joints.

Symptoms typically occur between age 50 and 75 years. Some women are able to get through all stages of menopause without any problems while others experience more severe symptoms.

Some women report pain and/or swelling around their pelvic area at night when they have no periods while others describe this sensation as continuous and intense. Symptoms can include hot flashes, mood swings, irritability, loss of libido, weight gain, low energy, anxiety and depression, fatigue, shortness of breath and other chronic conditions that mimic symptoms of MS. It is estimated that 5% of women over the age of 45 will develop some form of MS. Women who suffer from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who have had a hysterectomy may be at an increased risk for developing ovarian cancer.

Q: what is a wisdom tooth? Answer: the first of two molars. It grows in front of and behind your cheekbone. The upper one (or more often, both) are used to eat food or chew gum. The lower one is used for brushing. They're also used in other things like walking and yawning.


What causes wisdom teeth to disappear:

A person's genes determine whether a person will have all or some of their wisdom teeth removed when they reach adulthood. Those who don't get rid of them usually won't need surgery, but it can sometimes be necessary if there's pain from chewing too hard or swallowing too much saliva.


Why do people lose wisdom teeth? There aren't really any good answers; it could just be bad luck or not getting enough exercise as an adult. In addition, some experts say that people may lose wisdom teeth because of a medical problem, such as a dental infection, which makes it harder for the jawbone to heal properly. Some studies suggest that the longer you wait to get wisdom teeth out, the less likely you'll survive.


How should I care for my wisdom teeth? To keep them healthy, you should clean and floss them at least twice daily. You can use fluoride toothpaste, but avoid mouthwash with fluoride because some dentists recommend using only water with no fluoride and others don't recommend it. If you want to remove a few wisdom teeth yourself, follow these instructions from a dentist.

gpt2-xl_35,"Yes! Ketones, by definition are the body's preferred fuel source. A diet that is high in fat and low in carbohydrates stimulates the production of ketone bodies. These fatty acids can be broken down by your liver into usable sugar (glucose). This means you don't have to worry about your blood glucose levels falling below normal or getting stuck at dangerous levels as you work towards reaching an ideal weight. People who are diabetic need to control their blood sugars because it sets them up to develop type 2 diabetes. If you start using ketosis (burning fat instead of carbs) early enough then you can avoid developing type 2 diabetes. The following picture shows what happens when your body burns fat instead of carbohydrates.

What do I do if I am not ready to use ketosis?

If you haven't used ketosis yet then the best thing to do is take one meal a day during your transition period and gradually increase the number of meals. After starting a low carb, ketogenic diet (or any other low calorie diet) you should always aim to keep your carbohydrate intake below 50g per day (5oz). You will be able to start burning fat much more easily once you get rid of all those pesky cravings. However, there is also no reason why you shouldn't try to reduce your carbohydrate intake even further so that you are around 50-60g per day (4.8 – 5oz). This will help to decrease the amount of carbohydrate being stored as glycogen. Remember too that you still want to limit protein consumption during this time, although you may be tempted to eat a little more meat, fish or dairy products.

How long does it usually take me to reach my goal weight after starting a ketogenic diet?

This varies from person to person but typically starts off within 3 weeks. However, you can often lose a lot of weight without having started a very restrictive diet and so you could see results sooner.

Can I follow a low carb diet long term?

Yes! Although most people find that they need to make some adjustments along the way. A recent study found that someone on a strict low carb diet has lost 14 pounds after 9 months which was amazing! It would seem that your insulin sensitivity improves significantly while losing weight. There are also many studies showing that once you achieve ketosis, you are less likely to crave sweets.

How many calories do I burn doing active tasks? Answer: The number varies from person to person. You may not be able to keep track as well as you should or count calories for the full day, but it's best to find out how much activity you need each day. One rule of thumb is that if you walk more than 1 mile (1.6 km) per hour, your body will use about 0.5 to 2 calories per minute. This is based on the average daily mileage of an adult walking 5 miles (8 km). If you exercise outside more often in colder weather, you might get away with burning fewer calories per minute. Your goal is to burn at least 150 calories per hour. For example, if you start every morning by getting up at 6:30 am and continuing to walk until lunchtime, then you'd burn 150 calories in 30 minutes, which would take an additional 40 minutes total to reach the goal. In other words, you have to increase your pace over time to meet the goal.


What are the health risks associated with excess sedentary behavior? Answer: Too little physical activity is linked to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, sleep apnea, depression, obesity, high blood pressure, cancer, arthritis, and some types of cancer. Excess sedentary behavior leads to several other serious diseases including hypertension, heart attack, stroke, arthritis, obesity, impaired immune function, osteoarthritis, and Type 2 diabetes. Sedentary behaviors also affect people who aren't physically active. People who sit too much are twice as likely to die prematurely from any cause as those who stand or move less during their leisure time. They're also four times more likely to develop certain cancers. The good news is that even though you don't want to ""lose weight,"" being sedentary isn't necessarily unhealthy. By simply moving more when you feel tired, you'll reduce the risk of premature death and improve overall quality of life.


Why do Americans spend so much time sitting? Answer: When we sit down, our brains release dopamine into our reward circuits. Dopamine is a chemical messenger in our brain that helps us feel pleasure and excitement. Sitting all day, however, disrupts this natural process, turning dopamine back on and making us feel bored or frustrated. This makes us crave something else to fill our idle hours – coffee, TV, computer games, and so forth.

In some cases, psoriasis affects only the skin; in others, it can develop on any part of the body. Psoriasis often begins during childhood or adolescence and may last into adulthood. While most people who have psoriasis don't need treatment, many do experience side effects from medications used for psoriasis such as steroids. Because psoriasis affects so many different areas of your body, your doctor may recommend further evaluation if you experience serious side effects. Psoriasis may be associated with other conditions such as diabetes mellitus, thyroid problems, and allergies. The type of psoriasis can vary greatly depending on how much time it has been active. A simple case of psoriasis does not require hospitalization. However, some more severe types of psoriasis may require medical care or surgery. In milder forms of this disease, patients may be able to use home remedies to treat their condition without medication.

Q: How long does a single dose of steroids take to work?\nAnswer: Steroids need time to act. Typically, it takes between 8 and 48 hours for the steroid to be absorbed through the skin. As the steroids travel down the bloodstream, they enter into the cells. They are then taken up by immune system cells that eliminate them from the body. The effects of steroids begin within 24 hours, but their lasting effects may last up to six months.

Q: Is there any risk associated with steroids or use of corticosteroid medications?\nAnswer: There's a potential for increased blood pressure and cholesterol levels, as well as other risks such as heart attacks and strokes. However, there are many benefits associated with using steroids for MS. And the side effects usually aren't serious.

Q: What if my doctor tells me to stop taking my steroids after two weeks because they're not working?\nAnswer: You should discuss this decision with your health care team and ask what type of testing will be done before making an official withdrawal. If you continue on steroids, talk with your doctors again to make sure that they understand why you think they've stopped working. Also, keep in mind that even though your doctor says steroids don't work, he or she might still recommend using them, so always check with your doctor first.

Q: My family doctor said steroids could increase the risk of osteoporosis (bone thinning). Will steroids cause bone loss?\nAnswer: Steroids do not raise blood calcium levels. However, steroids do affect bone strength. So, men who are currently taking steroids may want to monitor their bones during the next three years while avoiding high-impact activities like lifting weights or exercising.

Q: Are there other ways to treat MS?\nAnswer: Most people find relief with medication alone. But some experts say taking drugs called biologic agents may also relieve symptoms. These medicines often involve combination therapy. They are used along with steroids to reduce inflammation and speed recovery from multiple sclerosis. Many experts now believe these new drugs can help slow or even reverse progression of MS. Biologics include cyclophosphamide, infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab and natalizumab.

Calorie Restriction / Metabolic Phase Loss


What to Eat

Eating well is key to losing weight. A good way to maintain your metabolism while cutting is to eat high quality protein such as chicken breast, turkey leg quarters, lean beef, salmon, tofu, eggs etc... You need protein every 2 hours. A great source of protein is beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, pumpkin seeds and peanut butter. Protein is also known as essential amino acids. It's found in all food but is most concentrated in animal products. In order to get enough protein it helps to consume low fat dairy products like cheese, yogurt, sour cream and milk, nuts and peanuts, and seeds like flax seed oil. Avoid foods that contain added sugar (sucrose) like candy, cookies, cakes, chips and sodas. Limit alcohol as much as possible. Also keep in mind that too many carbs in the diet at once can slow down your metabolism and cause hunger pangs.

Dietary Fats

A healthy diet is composed mainly of fatty meats like fish and meat, poultry, pork, duck, bacon, sausage, ham, lard, sausages, eggs etc.. It's important to avoid fats from unhealthy sources such as processed junk food. Fat intake is determined by the body. If your weight is stable then it means you are eating enough fat and avoiding unnecessary carbohydrates. However, if your weight fluctuates then you're likely consuming too many calories. To prevent unwanted weight gain eat a variety of foods each day including vegetables, fruits, whole grain cereals, beans, whole grains and fruits.

Q2: How long do I have before symptoms start appearing?\nAnswer: The most common initial signs of MS are numbness and tingling (sometimes called ""somatosensory"" or ""myalgic"" pain) at rest, particularly on one side of your body. These are typically felt only when you're sitting still and do not occur during activity. However, these symptoms tend to worsen over the course of days, weeks, months, and even years. Eventually, patients with MS report more widespread nerve damage from repeated exposure to nerves in their legs, back, arms, hands, feet, etc., leading them to feel ""pins and needles"" in those areas. Symptoms also usually appear within 2-3 months after a person develops symptoms of multiple sclerosis. By that point, the condition has probably progressed significantly since the beginning, and many people find it difficult to walk independently again. They might still lose weight but will still need assistance moving around, and they'll often experience some level of neurological impairment. People who recover quickly usually never regain full use of all limbs. Even if they eventually regain their ability to move about independently, they might continue to have difficulty walking.

Q3: What treatments exist for MS?\nAnswer: There isn't yet any cure for MS, but there are ways to manage symptoms without medication. In general, doctors prescribe anti-inflammatory medications such as aspirin to reduce inflammation and lower the risk of stroke or heart attack. This type of therapy may help relieve muscle stiffness, weakness, headaches, and fatigue. Other types of drugs include steroids used to treat inflammation or blood thinners used to prevent clotting. It's important to talk to your doctor about what type of treatment is right for you. Also, keep in mind that some individuals with MS develop complications from steroid therapy, so ask your doctor about whether you should stop taking the drug. If you take medicines for MS, you'll want to make sure you know the potential risks and benefits of each type of medicine, including possible interactions between different drugs and supplements.",63,Will multiple sclerosis affect my career?,-0.0364630296826362,4,question,4,0.016,371,2

The main symptoms are pain, stiffness, weakness, vision problems and hearing loss. The condition can be severe, causing paralysis or partial paralysis. The average life expectancy for those with MS is 10 to 15 years.[i]\r

What is the best treatment for multiple sclerosis?\r

Many different therapies have been tried in an effort to find a cure for MS. Some medications help alleviate some of these symptoms. While some types of medication are used alone, others may require daily maintenance therapy. For example, steroids are prescribed for many conditions. However, they aren't effective for all MS patients, so other forms of treatment may also be needed.

Other treatments involve using natural medicines such as vitamin supplements. These have proven effective for some patients who haven't responded well to other medical treatments. Others use immune-modulating drugs called immunomodulators that modulate the immune response. Although there's no cure yet for multiple sclerosis, improving your quality of life through treatments like acupuncture, massage, exercise, stress reduction, diet changes and nutrition are considered effective ways to treat your MS.

Why did doctors fail to diagnose me with multiple sclerosis until I was much older than my parents and younger than my siblings?\r

Doctors don't generally know if someone has MS because of their appearance or behavior unless a person develops some physical signs. If you've ever had trouble breathing, dizziness, blurred vision, numbness or tingling, weakness or difficulty walking, you probably have MS. You'll likely need a thorough exam by a doctor to rule out other conditions before making any diagnoses. \r

How do I avoid getting MS?\r

To prevent MS from happening, learn what causes the inflammation and damage that causes pain and disability in many people with MS. Avoid foods high in omega 6 fatty acids that are known to increase blood levels of this fatty acid, such as butter, chicken and fish oil. Limit your intake of processed sugar. Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables. Also reduce your risk factors for heart disease, diabetes, obesity and smoking by eating healthy food choices and exercising regularly. \r

gpt2-xl_52,"The major categories of mental illnesses include mood disorders (depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety), impulse control disorders (impulsivity, irritability, aggression, impulsivity-aggression disorders, conduct disorder), eating disorders (eating disorder not otherwise specified) and substance use disorders. Each type of illness is associated with different risk factors and may require a specialized treatment approach to be successfully treated. Most people do not have any symptoms at all until they develop an illness that puts them at high risk for developing serious consequences including death (e.g., depression).

What are some indicators of mental illness?\u003c answer\u003c

Symptoms \u0026amp; Complaints Symptoms usually begin during adolescence or early adulthood. They often present as changes in mood or behavior. The presence of these symptoms does not mean that you should seek medical attention for the illness. If you experience frequent mood swings, feelings of low self worth or guilt, feeling detached from others, trouble sleeping or concentrating, being easily agitated or overly angry or depressed, or having thoughts about suicide, you may need professional help. Some common signs of mental illness include: Irritability – Feelings such as anger or hostility, difficulty controlling temper, or aggressive outbursts are typical. Distress, helplessness, hopelessness, fear, sadness, confusion, anxiety, insomnia, irritability, and frustration are also common. Depression or Suicidal Thoughts Depression and suicidal thinking are common among those who suffer from bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness). These behaviors may occur before someone has had episodes of mania or depression or when there is no clear history of prior manic-like or depressive episodes. However, anyone struggling with severe depression, suicidal ideation, or other severe psychiatric distress should speak with their physician immediately for evaluation, if possible. Menstrual Disorders Many women who take antidepressants experience worsening menstrual symptoms (i.e., irregular periods) after discontinuation of therapy. Such bleeding or spotting may be related to a chemical imbalance caused by overstimulation of the brain's natural serotonin-producing pituitary gland by estrogen. In addition, certain SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) can cause breast cancer.

gpt2-xl_51,"The term ""holistic"" was coined in the early 1970s by Dr. H. Richard Nierenberg of the National Cancer Institute to describe an approach to cancer care that incorporates a combination of traditional medical approaches and alternative, complementary, or integrative modalities. Examples of these modalities are naturopathic (the use of natural healing) and chiropractic (using manipulative energy). Many people who are interested in this kind of care are referred to as ""holistic doctors."" These doctors may be practitioners who practice other forms of medicine, including conventional surgery or other more conventional forms of treatment. Others work with traditional Chinese, Indian, and Ayurvedic treatments. Some specialize in a particular area such as integrative oncology, nutritional therapies, or nutritional counseling.

When referring to holistic physicians, many health insurance companies refer to them as ""integrative physicians,"" which refers to the fact that they combine conventional and nontraditional methods of treatment in their approach to treating patients. For example, in a case where a patient has undergone chemotherapy for breast cancer but wants to maintain a low-fat diet, she would likely be considered an integrative physician, rather than an alternative practitioner. However, if her doctor prescribed other kinds of treatments besides conventional chemotherapy (such as dietary changes), then she would not be classified as being ""holistic"" per se; instead, she would be called a conventional practitioner of alternative cancer care. As part of its commitment to providing coverage for all forms of medical care, most major health plans offer comprehensive benefits packages including services from both mainstream health care providers and alternative practitioners. In addition, health insurance companies often offer incentives to encourage individuals to participate in certain activities, including participating in medical research or attending clinical trials. This type of participation helps ensure that patients receive high quality care at reasonable cost. While this can make some people uneasy, it also offers protection against having to spend outlay money to purchase insurance products that aren't designed to meet your needs.",51,What is holistic medicine and what does it include?,-0.1385015547275543,6,question,4,0.03208556149732621,326,7
gpt2-xl_114,"Borderline Personality Disorder - BPD is a mental health condition that can cause a person to have problems regulating emotions, making decisions and making connections with others. It's considered by some experts to be the most common mental illness in America. The average age of onset for adults with BPD is 20 years old and it can affect anyone at any time of their lives, but people are more likely to begin experiencing these issues as they approach adulthood. What is BPD? Bipolar Disorder (Bipolar) Disorder is a mental health disorder that involves changes or mood swings in your brain. These shifts can happen suddenly and unpredictably, over weeks or months. Some people with bipolar disorder experience manic episodes during which they feel extremely energetic, talk a lot about new things or show unusual energy levels, while other times they may experience depressive episodes when things get difficult. Sometimes there are also mixed phases or a ""split"" between what you might call an ""anxiety"" phase and a ""mania"" phase. Why do I have Borderline Personality Disorder? There are many possible reasons why someone could develop BPD, such as: A childhood history of being abused or neglected

A strong family history of mental illness

A biological predisposition towards developing BPD

Experiencing stressors prior to diagnosis

Having poor self-image, low self-esteem or poor functioning in social situations

Neglecting important responsibilities or losing them due to depression, anxiety, substance abuse or physical challenges

Being sexually assaulted or traumatized in a way that led to lasting effects on personal relationships Borderline Personality Disorder - Treatment of BPD For people who struggle with bipolar disorder, treatment usually begins with medication. However, there are several different types of medications that help treat BPD, including: Ativan (lorazepam)

Abilify (aripiprazole)

Paxil (paroxetine hydrochloride)

Clonidine (clorgyline hydrochloride)

A8. He only gets on the bus once every 3-5 minutes (on average) and at least twice a day at work. I've seen him go for over an hour each time. Sometimes we drive to pick him up from his job in South Carolina and then take him back home because there are no public transportation options for us here.


He is currently taking Adderall. He takes it until 1pm almost everyday now. For some reason though, we haven't yet been able to make it happen that he would ride on the bus for longer than 2 hours. This is especially frustrating when all of our friends have cars so they can come pick him up at 4am and he still has not taken off the meds by noon and instead stays late.

What if I've never had it?

Q. What's the best way for me to know if I'm in a high-risk group of people who develop my form of MS?\nAnswer: If you have an abnormal CT scan, your doctor can make an educated guess about whether you are more likely than others to develop this disease. This is called ""prevalence"" or ""clustering."" But it won't tell you exactly which MS symptoms and signs you're most at risk for. You'll need another type of test — one that uses genetic testing — to learn what kind of MS you might have. Genetic tests work by analyzing how closely related groups of cells on your body express genes associated with MS. If you carry these genes, then the diseases are more likely to run together.

The National Multiple Sclerosis Society has helpful information on identifying MS risks. The Mayo Clinic also offers information about detecting and treating MS.

How do doctors determine if I have MS?

Q. Can MS be treated?\nAnswer: No. Most types of treatment for MS are based on medications. Doctors generally agree that drugs that help control inflammation, reduce nerve damage and stimulate the immune system are effective. Medications used to treat MS often increase the effectiveness of other medicines. They can sometimes improve symptoms without causing side effects. For instance, steroids reduce muscle stiffness caused by MS. Some drugs slow the progression of the disease, though they don't cure it. When possible, doctors recommend using them alongside other treatments, such as physical therapy.

Many people prefer alternative therapies, too, including acupuncture, chiropractic care and meditation. Aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen are commonly prescribed for pain when treating MS. Corticosteroids can be used to prevent joint swelling, but they shouldn't be taken long term because they raise the risk of bleeding. Long-term use of corticosteroids can cause problems like increased cholesterol levels, ulcers, kidney stones and diabetes.

This is an actual question from the forum that was solved by a student. The problem is that if you take the cube and do 3-dimensions of each face, then you will end up with 4 cubes instead of three (the original solution) so this could be very useful to solve other common problems such as 2x2x3 etc

Another example of a difficult problem is solving 5x5x4 or 4x4x4, but in order to get these numbers you need to have the top left corner of all 6 cubes on the bottom right and all 4 in the upper right

One way of doing this would be to find the two pieces which are at the same height, and put them next to each other to make 1 of each, and then repeat until there are 5 of one type, and 7 of another type. This is called ""bracketing"", and can be done using the following steps:

Find all 4 corners of both pieces next to each other, and put the 4th one on the right side

Then find the two pieces that are exactly the same size, place the one next to the other and create another of their kind

Repeat until there are 7 types, which is where we started

The only thing needed to finish this step is to find the exact distance between the first 4 corners. For this calculation, use the following equation:


If you add the four lengths of each piece, you should get the number of spaces between the middle two corners. If you add those 4 lengths together you should come up with the total length needed for any one corner. So your answer to the problem above should now read ""6.7"" which is the correct answer!

What to Do When Your Son Has a Seizure

1. Get him into the backseat of your car. A large stuffed animal (like a cat) will make this easier.

2. Take one good look at him, then tell him to lie down on his stomach. You'll see he is sweating profusely, which means he may have gotten very thirsty. If he cries too much, open the window a bit. But don't force him; rather, use gentle guidance as you get close to him so that he feels comfortable lying flat. Once he lies down, you should see him starting to breathe normally again – usually within minutes.

3. Tell someone else about this situation right away. Be sure to say the name of the person who brought your child to the ER and ask them to call 911.

4. Call 811 immediately. Make sure you leave a message telling them who called and where the child was taken. Be sure to mention your own name as well. Then, wait for an operator to arrive – ideally before 5 p.m. The dispatcher will help with any questions or concerns you have. After all, they'll be trying to figure out how your child got here.

5. If the ambulance crew arrives at the scene, stay calm – keep talking to the crew. Listen carefully, even if you aren't sure what they're saying. They",127,glasses for computer,-12.826069831848145,61,question,4,0.9242424242424242,405,1
gpt2-xl_92,"Treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome:

Lack of sleep is one of the most important symptoms that are experienced by patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. Although many people may have difficulty falling asleep at night, for those who suffer from this illness it can become a source of great distress and frustration. The majority of individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome report being bothered by problems with their sleep. A study carried out by scientists from the University of Exeter Medical School showed that 50% of people with long-term fatigue reported having trouble sleeping at least once per week. Sleep apnea (a condition where the breathing pauses during sleep) was also found to be common among these patients. Other potential causes include stress, poor diet or lack of exercise. Most commonly though, the cause of chronic fatigue is due to the breakdown in the central nervous system. This occurs when there is damage to the central nervous system leading to low levels of energy production, muscle weakness, depression, pain, loss of appetite, headache and cognitive difficulties.


As with most disorders, however, treatment depends on an individual's specific needs. For some people with the condition, rest and relaxation techniques such as meditation or deep breathing therapy help reduce anxiety, improve concentration skills and alleviate symptoms associated with mood swings and emotional upsets. However, other strategies including psychotherapy and medication may prove more successful at controlling certain aspects of the disease and improving quality of life for patients with MS.

Post 5 My name is Michelle and I have just started the first year of high school. As soon as my son was born, he began getting headaches, vomiting and diarrhea, I did not know at the time but we were dealing with Hashimoto thyroiditis (a form of autoimmune disease). Since then my body went through a lot of changes. While the symptoms are different each time, I am still seeing all of these new symptoms that I never saw before. The worst symptom is having trouble swallowing food because of the constant pain in my throat and jaw. Another symptom I experience is being unable to sleep, sometimes waking up several times throughout the night, while some nights I only sleep 4 hours or less. I think the pain from the migraines is also affecting this, since when you're tired, your brain doesn't really work as well. It seems like every time I take two aspirin and relax, there is another headache coming out. I have seen a psychiatrist about a month ago and am starting to see results now. We're slowly beginning to heal from the initial problems, but it takes time. It is hard to explain how much of an effect medication has on your body, but it seems that a lot of the issues have something to do with serotonin. It seems that taking more than one pill per day may cause depression and anxiety in certain people. This would be very rare though and I believe most people will be fine without multiple pills per day. I'm hoping that I'll be able to finish high school and continue my education. view entire post

Q: What is MS? A: Multiple sclerosis (MS) refers to progressive disease that affects the central nervous system in which damaged cells destroy nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. About 50 percent of people diagnosed with MS develop more than one type of the disorder and can suffer from paralysis in one or both legs. The remaining half are either completely unaffected or have only mild disability. Some types of MS result in no pain or sensory changes; others cause severe attacks that involve uncontrollable shaking or trembling. One type, called relapsing-remitting MS, usually starts in early adulthood but can be diagnosed as late as 40 years old. In some cases it develops slowly over time, affecting several areas of the body at once. There is currently no cure for MS. Treatment is designed to reduce symptoms and slow down progression. Most patients experience gradual improvement over time, although a small percentage will continue to experience significant impairments. The current treatment approach involves drugs such as steroids (such as prednisone), immunosuppressants (like interferon gamma or glatiramer acetate), and sometimes other medications. In addition, doctors may prescribe physical therapy and behavioral therapies (for example, mindfulness training). For those who cannot tolerate the side effects associated with these treatments, there are a variety of nonpharmacological options, including acupuncture and massage therapy.

Q: How does an MS patient use a computer keyboard?A: An MS patient typically uses their right hand to activate and navigate on a screen and left hand to adjust settings. Although it may take practice, they should learn how to move around comfortably while using a mouse.

It's important to remember that using a touchscreen device, like an iPad, requires you to hold your arm out straight in front of you rather than bend toward your chest as you would when typing.

Q: Are there any other conditions which might also lead to a reduction in cognitive function?

A: There is some evidence suggesting that depression can decrease cognitive functioning. However, this has not been replicated in clinical trials. The data from these studies does suggest that depression can contribute to decreased cognitive functioning. A few studies have shown an association between dementia and depression. This is most likely due to differences in how these two diseases manifest themselves. Both Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) involve disruption of brain cell communication in various parts of the brain. These disruptions produce many symptoms including fatigue, impaired concentration and difficulty making decisions. It seems possible that both AD and PD can affect different parts of the brain resulting in dysfunction related to memory. Depression could result from the stress associated with living with AD and/or PD.


Diabetes and Cognitive Function

Q: What types of diabetes medications should I take while taking MS drugs? Is it safe to use medications if you have no control over your blood sugar level?

A: For most patients, we recommend starting with the lowest dose that will provide adequate treatment. When using insulin, be sure that you're following all directions provided by your healthcare professional when administering your medication. If you experience side effects such as drowsiness, dizziness or lightheadedness on the drug (especially long-acting insulin), contact your healthcare provider immediately. Some medications can cause serious harm if taken improperly and even overdose. Always read the label, and consult your healthcare professional before beginning any type of medication.

Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking MS drugs? Do I need to limit my drinking?

#3 – How to do a Basic Side Lie

Lie face down on your side with your legs straight. Make sure your knees are on the floor. Keeping your chest up and eyes closed take your hands off of your feet, turn around and place them on either side of your head, like this:

Then you will rotate your hips clockwise so that your right hip is parallel to the ground while rotating your left hip at the same time. You should feel something similar to this:

Now as before, push yourself away from your body, keep your arms overhead and try to pull your head into your shoulders.

As in any other Side Lie exercise use both sides equally.

#4 – How to Do Backbends

To perform a back bend it's necessary for you to know two things: first of all you have to hold onto an object and secondly you have to stretch or relax. As I mentioned before holding onto an object can be quite challenging so if you don't have access to one then there are plenty of alternatives which allow you to extend your spine without having to go to extremes.

The most common options include using pillows to support your upper body. When laying flat on top of these pillow you will make it more difficult for gravity to compress your spinal discs. If this isn't possible then the next best thing would be to position your upper body underneath something sturdy such as a desk chair.

When doing a back bend always keep your weight distributed evenly across both shoulders to ensure that your muscles are properly engaged during each step.

A simple way to practice the movement is to start by simply lowering your body slightly and then slowly raising it back up again. It's important that your head doesn't move too far forward but instead stay perfectly level throughout.

Q11: I have been having intense headaches for about a year, not sleeping well or even feeling like myself. It feels as if my head is exploding! What can be done?

A: There are many things that can happen with migraine headaches. Most often you will feel your head hurts, but it doesn't always hurt; sometimes they don't bother you at all.

You may also notice changes in your vision, numbness, tingling, light sensitivity, difficulty concentrating (even when trying to do something), problems focusing on what you're doing, etc. You can get treatment for these symptoms too. In addition, you should talk to your doctor. They might suggest that you try other medications, such as anti-seizure drugs, so that you can avoid medication side effects.

A: If you still want to continue taking birth control and you can afford it, there's no need to hide from your wife. She'll know exactly how much better you are than she did before you stopped. Keep asking yourself questions, especially ""Why am I being so tired?"" as soon as you wake up in the morning and ""How bad was my night last night?"" as you drift off to sleep.

In fact, let her know how good she looks. Tell her how beautiful you look when you eat well and exercise regularly. Let her know how much more rested you feel and how much better your moods are now.

Tell her everything you see when you see her. Be honest with her because you never know how important some information may be. She probably won't understand how good you feel until she sees it herself. When you have time together, tell each other anything else that comes into your mind, including any concerns about your body or feelings about food or lifestyle choices.

Myth #11. ""You have less chance of getting heart disease if you're vegetarian""

This is one I've heard a lot. This is not true at all. The American Heart Association recommends that people with heart disease should be eating more fat and cholesterol (especially saturated fats), while being much healthier on a plant-based diet. A study published in 2014 found that vegetarians had better health than omnivores and that they lived longer. In fact, the life expectancy of vegans was 25 years longer on average than meat eaters.

The reason for this difference? It's because animals are raised in such horrible conditions that it causes them chronic inflammation. Vegetarianism prevents these problems from occurring in humans. Also, studies show that when you eliminate grains, legumes, dairy and alcohol, your risk of dying from cancer goes down by 50 percent, strokes by 40 percent, diabetes by 30 percent and obesity by 20 percent. These factors can increase your chances of developing other diseases as well. This means more life!


In the end, our bodies depend heavily on carbohydrates, so we shouldn't be trying to live without them. Instead, we should try to maximize what we do have. And there are plenty of ways to do that—from eating enough vegetables and fruits to drinking lots of water.

A note about the US government: the National Institutes of Health has issued dietary guidelines stating that Americans should consume no more than 10% of their total calories from red meat and that no more than 50 grams of processed meats per week should count toward your weekly intake. But the guidelines don't go into detail about which foods are acceptable or even healthy for certain groups. So just follow whichever recommendations you find most convenient for you.

gpt2-xl_108,"The key question is whether the effects of BH4 on these variables were due to increased activity or decreased activity. If they were due to increased activity, then it would be expected that those with the highest levels of BH4 should also have the greatest improvement in their symptoms while those with the lowest levels would see the least benefit from the treatment. Conversely, if the changes occurred because of diminished activity, the patients who had high amounts of BH4 and/or lower concentrations of ATP would still likely show some symptoms when given a low dose of BH4, which could explain why there was no clear statistical difference between the two groups. Thus, although we can say that reduced activity may reduce the likelihood of an adverse response, this does not necessarily mean that such responders will experience fewer negative side effects than those who do respond favorably. It is possible that both the magnitude of the responses (i.e., less or more severe) and the type of side effect are related. As discussed below, the exact nature of the relationship between factors, as well as the reason for differences observed between the two groups, need further investigation.

Effects on Cognitive Function.

We hypothesized that low doses of BH4 might help improve cognitive functioning. To test this hypothesis, three different measures of cognition were administered in our study group using multiple measures. We used two tests designed specifically to evaluate cognitive function in patients with IBS. The first measure was the Trail Making Test (TMT), a standard measure of working memory and decision making that has been found to predict future academic performance [36]. TMT scores were obtained before and after administration of 10 mg of BH4 via subcutaneous injection in 15 healthy adults. This dose elicited a significant increase in TMT scores compared to placebo, suggesting that increasing BH4 by 10 mg produced a measurable change in cognitive performance. The second measure was the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, a standard measure of attentional control [37], that provides information about the ability to use symbols as primary strategies during mental tasks [38]. While a moderate effect size was observed at baseline and at the end of the trial, participants receiving BH4 were able to perform substantially better after the 10 mg dose than after placebo. Moreover, a similar but stronger effect was seen after all doses of BH4. These results suggest that taking a 10 mg dose of BH4 resulted in significantly improved performance on a cognitive task involving working memory and other types of executive functions. Further, this suggests that reducing",108,chronic diarrhea short-term memory sweating inability to regulate body temperature heart palpitations dysautonomia,-9.694790840148926,40,question,4,0.6779661016949152,431,10

But it is very expensive and takes years before these drugs start working well in most people. The best method right now is lifestyle change. If you exercise regularly, eat healthy foods, watch what you eat and drink (especially water), try to avoid or limit consumption of processed foods and sugars, and don't smoke, then all of those things can work together to keep your blood glucose level under control.

Q: How long does a person have to take medications for diabetes?\nAnswer: It's not unusual at all for someone with type 1 diabetes to stay on insulin until they're old enough to no longer need medication for their condition. In fact, some studies show that children who remain on insulin as kids may even outlive their parents! Some adults can have good control of their blood sugar through diet alone, which may last up to 10 years.

Q: What happens if I stop taking my medication?\nAnswer: You could die. So make sure that you continue to get your insulin injections and any other treatment that has been recommended by your doctor. If you've tried different forms of therapy without success, talk to your doctor about switching to an implantable device called a glucometer. A glucometer monitors the amount of sugars in your body — whether from food or beverages — and tells you when you should take your insulin. It is especially useful during severe hypoglycemia.

Q: Are there any side effects to keeping a close eye on your glucose level?\nAnswer: Not really. If you're overweight, taking care of your weight might help bring down the number of times per day that you have trouble controlling your blood sugar level. It might also reduce your chances of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life.

Q: When do my daily doses of insulin begin?\nAnswer: Your doctor determines exactly how much of each injection to give you every morning, so remember that this depends largely on your weight and height. Your dose starts when you first go to sleep after eating breakfast. For example, if your BMI is 25-29, the dose would start when you wake up between 6 and 7 a.m., and continue until 8 p.m. After that time period, it increases slightly every night.

This is the top question that I get asked. But there are multiple answers to this and some of them may surprise you. This is because it's a very complicated topic, but for now let's just focus on one answer, which we've discussed in our previous article, The Best Pillow Neck Pain Treatment Guide.

The answer is to avoid hard objects, such as books, magazines or your laptop, at all times when sleeping. There are two reasons why this works; firstly by preventing pressure build-up inside the cervical spine, secondly by restricting blood flow to the spinal cord.

Let's look at each point in detail.

1. Avoid Hard Objects

You might think that avoiding hard objects during sleep will be a waste of time – they'll probably do more harm than good. If they cause any damage then your headache will probably become worse as well as the risk of developing postural headaches (the same headache you would have if you were lying down). So why bother?

Well you can actually prevent headaches and migraines from happening.

In order to find out whether soft tissue injuries caused by sleeping on hard surfaces such as pillows has an effect on headache severity, researchers carried out three studies with over 600 participants. All subjects were healthy young men and women who did not suffer from any neurological conditions that could affect their ability to perform routine tasks. The tests involved measuring the number of pressure points recorded and also assessing patients' general health, symptoms of fatigue, and psychological factors like anxiety. Participants had their head measured using an interventional device that measures pressure points and brain activity.

Results showed that the number of pressure points increased significantly after waking up, so the authors concluded that pressure points increase the risk of headache for everyone. They also found that having lower total and pressure pain scores was associated with higher migraine prevalence. Additionally, people who reported feeling tired before bed had more headache pain compared with those who felt no need to rest.

So even though these results show that pressure points causes headaches, most people still don't want to avoid sleeping on hard surfaces – many of us use pillows for comfort rather than protection against injury.

2. Restrict Blood Flow To Spinal Cord

One common reason why people report headaches while sleeping is the restriction of blood circulation to the part of the body called the spinal cord, called lumbar vertebrae.

Q13. What is the average number of menstrual cycles per woman with and without oral contraceptives? A. The mean duration of menses was 27 days for women who had never used any hormonal contraceptive (3.6 months) or were taking only ethinyl estradiol-containing pills, whereas it was 31 days in those who took a combination pill containing both estrogen and progestin (3.8 months). In women using combined oral contraceptives, this median value also includes women on low dose norethindrone acetate capsules, because some women may have been exposed to more than one type of hormone during their menstrual cycle.

Q14. How many women take oral contraceptives each year? A. The most recent national estimate of the number of U.S. women aged 15 years and older using oral contraceptives was from 2003. For women ages 15 to 19 years, the estimated number of females using oral contraceptives each year ranges from 2.4 million to 3.2 million. For women 20 to 24 years old, the estimated number ranges from 1.9 million to 2.5 million; the corresponding figures for men are 6.7 million to 7.1 million (see Table C-2). Among young adult women who currently use oral contraceptives, approximately 8% report that they first took them at age 12 or younger and 17% reported having taken them as teenagers. This analysis does not include data on pregnancies.

Q. Should I take my medications as prescribed or with an oral supplement?

A. You should always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist. Taking medication orally may be more effective and less likely to cause side effects than taking pills. If you have taken a prescription medicine within the past seven days you should consult your physician before taking any new one as this could lead to adverse reactions or changes in how well these medicines work. The most common prescription medicines for POTS include: beta-blockers (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil); calcium channel blockers (e.g., sotalol, lisinopril) that are used when your heart rate is above 70/min; antihypertensives such as nitrates, phenylephrine or epinephrine; ACE inhibitors (such as amlodipine, celecoxib or ergotamine); corticosteroids (prednisone, prednisolone); beta-adrenergic agonists such as digoxin, guanethidine, levetiracetam, indomethacin; angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drugs such as etoricoxib or rizatriptan; calcium channel blockers such as valsartan, cyclosporine or cyclophosphamide; calcium channels blockers such as prasugrel and tamsulosin; glucocorticoid receptor antagonists such as doxazosin or zaleplon; histamine H 2 -receptor antagonist drugs such as meloxicam or nimodipine; magnesium sulfate and mineral oil (for those who need the extra help of these agents). In addition to these drugs, there are other drugs available on the market which can also have therapeutic applications. These include acetaminophen, aspirin, thienopyridines, tricyclics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, salbutamol, benztropine, flumetomide, gabapentin, memantine, metformin, probenecid, carbamazepine, gatifloxacin, oxcarbazepine, erythromycin, and others.

The first step in diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS) is to examine your medical history including:

Your current physical, mental, emotional, social and work difficulties;

Any previous symptoms of multiple sclerosis such as headaches, difficulty sleeping, tiredness, weakness, or numbness, hearing loss or problems with vision; and

In order to assess whether your MS has returned you need to make an appointment with your local Neurologists or Psychiatrists. The first stage is usually one visit where you sit down with your physician for a consultation. Depending on the situation, it could take up to three visits to find out if you are at risk for relapse again.


Once your neurologist has completed their evaluation they will prepare you for a full exam by performing tests which include:

An MRI scan using special X-ray equipment to check the brain structure and blood flow. This is sometimes used to monitor for changes in the production of certain chemicals in the central nervous system (CNS).

Yes. You can keep working even though you are getting better or feeling less tired. When you are unable to work because of a physical or mental illness, your doctor has advised you that you should try returning to work a few weeks later, perhaps following a break in treatment.

Some illnesses can lead to symptoms similar to those that occur during a short leave, such as headaches, nausea or fatigue. You might recover completely after a few weeks without going off work, but it is important to seek medical attention promptly if you think you are experiencing symptoms related to your disease. As long as you tell your supervisor or HR office when you start having some of these symptoms, they'll notify you in case it becomes necessary to stay home to rest.

gpt2-xl_77,"Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes the body's immune system to attack its own tissues, resulting in various neurological and physical problems. Menopause can be an important part of MS treatment as it decreases the amount of estrogen (the female hormone) produced by the ovaries, thus slowing down the progression of MS.

Q: Why are some women more prone to have polycystic ovarian syndrome than others? A: In general, if you suffer from excessive menstrual cycles, weight gain, acne, irregular periods or trouble conceiving, then chances are high that you may also have Poly Cystitis, the most common cyst-related disorder. While the exact cause for this condition isn't known, a number of factors can play into why some women develop polycystic ovarian syndrome while others don't. For example, it has been shown that women with higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol are more likely to develop the disease.[1] Additionally, certain genetic variations in the genes involved in metabolism can also increase your risk.


Q: What does fibroids mean to my uterus/uterus? A: Fibroids are abnormal growths on the walls of the uterus, which means they're not cancerous, but they may need to be treated. This is because fibroids represent waste buildups and are typically present at birth. These build up tissue that obstructs normal flow of urine, causing discomfort and pain during urination. Because they're often invisible, it's sometimes difficult to spot fibroids; however, you should see them when examining your pelvic region. When a fibroid grows rapidly, it may feel like a lump and may look similar to small bumps on the skin. If the growth becomes larger over time or when pressure is applied, it will become obvious. There are two types of fibroids. The benign ones are less severe, usually no bigger than 2 centimeters across. They'll disappear within 12 months after being removed. The malignant ones are about 3 centimeters in diameter and are usually very painful. Although they do shrink naturally over time, there are several options available for removal. One option involves using heat to soften and release them and another involves surgery. Surgery for benign fibroids is considered risky and requires extensive follow-up. Some doctors recommend having the growth surgically removed by a board certified surgeon who specializes in hysterectomies. If the fibroid grows so much that it blocks the flow of blood to other organs, the best treatment is to get a",77,How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?,-0.2950813472270965,2,question,5,0.008264462809917356,404,14

Q: Is there any medical evidence for the use of a diet containing soybean protein as an adjunct to treatment for chronic kidney disease?


A: The authors conclude that ""the present study does not support the use of dietary soy protein in patients with CKD."" They have no specific information about what supplements are used. The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed all of the available literature, including trials on diets and health outcomes, for this question. Their conclusion is shown below:

""...there was insufficient evidence of a beneficial effect of soy or its components in preventing chronic renal disease (CKD)...""


""There were also concerns regarding the lack of blinding and randomization. More studies would be needed to clearly demonstrate whether soy can reduce risk factors associated with CKD...""

Summary: There may be benefit from eating foods rich in soy protein in people who already consume them. For example, if you eat only a moderate amount of soy protein per day, you might have no more than 3 mg/day. That's quite low by Western standards - far lower than the FDA's upper limit of 6 mg/day for adults. Soyfoods may help those who don't yet feel well enough to manage their diabetes safely. And there are some studies suggesting that soy helps people lose weight when they're overweight. However, there isn't enough scientific evidence to say that it provides a clear advantage over other treatments for chronic kidney diseases.

They also think that the disclosure is not a big deal since this information can be obtained for free via medical records or from other sources.

Q: My employer has an internal policy against revealing someone's diagnosis or disability history when hiring them, though there's no specific mention of MS in the policy (or any similar policies). I was wondering if this could have implications if the individual in question also has a mental illness? Is it possible for employers to discriminate based on a person's mental illness without the employee being aware?\r


\n Answer: As far as I know, there are no written policies prohibiting employers from asking about mental illnesses in employment interviews; however, if you do ask questions about such things (e.g., ""Have you ever been diagnosed with a mental disorder?""), make sure your answers aren't phrased defensively. For example, saying you haven't had treatment might mean nothing if you're being asked about treatment for a recent relapse after some time off. If something does come up during the interview process that is relevant to your application, discuss this with HR and try to resolve the situation so that nobody feels harassed.

If you feel uncomfortable with this issue going forward, talk to a lawyer because federal law prohibits discrimination based on disability if a person receives preferential consideration. In order to protect yourself, try to keep these issues away from supervisors until the final stage of the hiring process. Also, don't be afraid to ask for clarification on an ambiguous reference. Don't let this discourage you -- you should be able to get references provided by friends, relatives or former coworkers. Also, remember that people sometimes have a tendency to lie about disabilities or conditions if they fear losing their livelihoods. You never want to take on a personal responsibility you can't handle.

A keto-adapted approach should be sufficient to prevent complications such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It can also improve health-related quality of life. The effects of the diet have been well documented in several studies on humans and animals. One key study was carried out on rats that were fed either a LCHF diet or a normal diet. Their bodies began to burn more glucose from foods when they switched from an ordinary carbohydrate-rich diet to a ketogenic one, resulting in a reduction in body weight. This was accompanied by changes in biochemical markers which indicate improved metabolic health. In other words, the rats' health conditions took on new characteristics associated with the ketogenic state.

Q25-26: Is it possible for me to get cancer from exercising too much?

A25-26: The risks are extremely low if done properly, however there is no way of knowing how many people in the history of mankind have got cancer because of over-exercise (especially since some cancers are not caused by exercise at all) and therefore the chances are very small but they can happen.

In addition to this, exercising does increase the levels of hormones that are known to cause breast cancer as well as other forms of cancer.

It should also be noted that the amount of calcium needed will decrease with exercise, so you may need more food than usual. This means you'll probably eat less before or after exercise. If this happens, then you must continue to eat normally afterwards.

However, many people recover fully without intervention within weeks, even months. If you have been diagnosed with MS and you're not experiencing any severe symptoms yet, it may be worth trying a diet that reduces inflammation in the body. The most common type of low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet is known as the Mediterranean diet, which consists primarily of whole grain foods (such as breads, cereals, rice, potatoes, pasta) eaten often together with olive oil, nuts, seeds, tomatoes, vegetables, olives, fish, poultry, and dairy products. Other types include vegetarian diets, which limit meat consumption; traditional Asian diets; and vegan diets. These dietary changes can help reduce your risk for developing MS-related brain damage by reducing excess inflammation. In addition to these simple dietary practices, exercise is another important factor in managing MS-related nerve cell damage. Researchers at Columbia University found that healthy older adults who exercised daily had significantly lower levels of plaque in their brains than those who did not exercise.

Q: what is the best method of getting rid of psoriasis?A: a combination of both psoralen and antibiotics. Psoralens are effective at reducing inflammation, while the antibiotic helps to kill bacteria that causes psoriasis. You should try both methods in order to see which works best for you.

Q: why does my skin become oily after using psoralens?A: this is caused when your body uses up the natural oils on your face, which makes them less available for the active ingredients of psoralens. The oil will build up again as soon as you start taking a new dose of psoralen or any other topical psoriasis treatment. This happens because psoralens have a unique structure, so they quickly reach their peak effectiveness before eventually going down. This can cause your skin to look greasy and flaky once more as soon as you stop using psoralens. To avoid this, use a moisturizer every day to help prevent skin breakdown and excess oil production. If oily skin persists, contact your doctor.

What are some signs of early pregnancy loss?

Sometimes there are no obvious symptoms at all. This happens often when women who haven't been pregnant for several years get pregnant during their monthly periods. In these cases, the cervix usually swells and closes up before the woman knows she is pregnant. However, sometimes an ultrasound scan shows something called uterine perforation - the opening into your uterus has become blocked with tissue from your fallopian tubes. Or there is cramping, which is like childbirth but painful. Other times a doctor may take a sample of amniotic fluid from your vagina (amniotomy), which gives them information about how far along you were in your pregnancy. This test also shows whether you had any prenatal tests to check for possible problems.


If you think you may be having a miscarriage or stillbirth, see your GP or midwife immediately. They'll do everything they can to help find out what's going on, including taking a blood sample and doing an ultrasound scan.

How well you feel about yourself—the more severe the symptoms you experience, the worse your mood is likely to be and the fewer opportunities you will have for promotion.

Whether or not other people around you are aware of your condition—if you cannot go for a new assignment because you cannot face another person's negative reaction, or if your boss has no idea you suffer from MS, then your chances of getting promoted will be diminished.

Your ability to think clearly while working, which means your memory might be impaired. This affects how quickly you memorize information and how accurate you are at recalling it later.

The number of hours you spend out in public, as you must travel by car, bus, subway, airplane, train or taxi to do certain tasks like shopping for groceries, going to doctor appointments, etc., and so forth.

A general limitation in your ability to concentrate—you may become tired easily, lose track of time when doing large amounts of reading, or get bored easily, all leading to less effort, higher workloads and more errors.

Other medical conditions that can cause some degree of difficulty in work performance include migraines, arthritis, lupus, allergies, thyroid disease, depression and diabetes. Some patients with MS are also prone to stress and anxiety related to their disorder. It can take considerable self-confidence to maintain good relationships, or even maintain friendships with others who don't share the same condition. Many employers expect employees with MS to wear a hat, gloves, eyeglasses, earplugs, eye patch, bracelets and even helmets when they come into work, and this can put them at an immediate disadvantage. And, of course, there is always the possibility that some form of accident will occur while driving (for example, a head injury) and cause a loss of control during a turn that could result in bodily harm. In addition, the cost of insurance increases substantially for those who have a disability due to MS, so that it becomes increasingly difficult to afford health care expenses. Some insurers limit coverage of workplace accidents, regardless of whether someone was injured. Employers should make sure they cover workers' compensation benefits—including treatment—when needed.

gpt2-xl_59,"It is a well established fact that multiple sclerosis (MS) has no known cure. Multiple Sclerosis affects approximately 1 in 500 people over the age of 50 and there are currently no effective treatments for this disease. Approximately 80% of MS patients will develop relapses of symptoms, which may be progressive or relapsing. Because relapse can occur at any point in the disease course and often occurs within months, MS patients are advised to continue taking their medication even when they feel better. If you have MS and have not had an episode of full blown remission yet, then it is best to monitor your progress with regular checkups and treatment as needed.

Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Options

There are currently three types of drug treatments available in the US: corticosteroids (prednisone), interferon beta (Avastin), and glatiramer acetate (Gleevec). The primary goal of these drugs is to prevent relapses of MS symptoms by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cells called myelin basic protein. By blocking this, MS patients can return to normal activity and recovery after a flare up of symptoms. In addition, these drugs reduce inflammation and increase white blood cell count. This helps keep the body healthy as a whole. Although this type of therapy does provide some relief from pain and other side effects, long term use of steroids can cause damage to bone marrow tissue. Also, doctors do recommend avoiding these drugs until all side effects have been resolved. However, if you are having severe joint pain or other problems such as blurred vision, dizziness, or depression then you should take caution in taking steroid medications.

Corticosteroids – Prednisone (dexamethasone) and Interferon Beta (Adalimumab)

This class of drugs is used to treat acute inflammation associated with an infection or autoimmune diseases like MS. They also block the release of white blood cells so that MS patients do not produce additional immune responses. Corticosteroid therapy causes an improvement in physical function, fatigue, swelling, and pain while reducing neurological symptoms such as numbness or tingling in extremities.

Interferon Beta (Avastin)

This type of medicine targets several different areas of the nervous system causing an imbalance between the active and inactive ingredients. These imbalance results in abnormal production of the substance interleukin 2 (IL2). Avastin blocks IL2 activity preventing the activation of myelin. The result of this is that patients see a",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-1.156486988067627,15,question,5,0.07352941176470588,392,7
gpt2-xl_54,"Multiple sclerosis is the most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting about one in every 2.5 million adults and children worldwide. The initial symptoms of MS are commonly referred to as ""meningitis."" These first symptoms may be mild (occurring on their own or within a few days after exposure to an infectious agent) but can rapidly progress into more serious problems such as seizures, paralysis, cognitive impairments, vision impairment, deafness and even death.

When a person develops MS, they often experience weakness throughout the body, including limbs, arms, legs and face. Their ability to walk and perform daily activities usually begins gradually and then worsens over time. Symptoms also vary from person to person, depending on how much damage has already been done by other diseases and what genetic vulnerabilities exist in that individual's DNA. Some people with MS have no noticeable changes when diagnosed, while others develop signs and symptoms that last for years before improvement occurs. There are currently two types of MS: relapsing-remitting and secondary-progressive. Relapsing-remitting forms occur in between 1% and 5% of cases, although up to 40% of individuals will eventually have this form of the disease. Secondary-progressive forms are caused by mutations in the gene that encodes for the protein called myelin basic protein. This is a major component of the protective covering around nerve fibers. When the myelin sheath wears away, the nerves become damaged and can lose function. Patients who have had MS for less than 10 years typically begin developing relapses during their 20s and 30s. In the early stages, people with progressive forms do not experience any symptoms, but over time, the brain may begin changing in ways that cause them pain, fatigue, depression, trouble speaking, difficulty walking and bladder control. By the late stages, many patients experience sensory loss, difficulty swallowing, muscle spasms, blurred vision, slurred speech, difficulty chewing and swallowing, and memory impairment. Although relapsing-remitting and secondary-progressive forms are considered different diseases, some researchers believe that these forms should actually be classified together as ""primary-onset"" or ""chronic,"" because each type can lead to significant disability in its own right.\r

The top five problems identified by survey respondents as being among their least desirable mental health problems include: depression, anxiety, stress/anxiety, substance abuse and suicidal thoughts (Hanson et al., 2011).


What causes mental illnesses? Psychosis may be a natural consequence of some illness-related brain changes (e.g., schizophrenia) or might result from specific experiences during childhood, adolescence or adulthood (Gillberg et al., 2008; Hanson et al., 2011). Other potential causes for psychosis include early trauma, head injury, stroke, chronic drug use and severe psychological distress.


Are there treatments for mental health issues? Some interventions, such as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), stress reduction techniques and medication have been shown to help with symptoms of certain mental disorders (e.g., PTSD) (Hanson et al., 2009). Others, such as psychotherapy (including group therapies), psychodynamic treatment and pharmacological treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, substance use disorders, traumatic brain injury or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), have not been shown to provide long term benefits (Blair, 2002). In addition, the effectiveness of these interventions varies greatly depending on the specific condition being treated (Clifton, 2000; Gillberg et al., 2008).


Is it true that I need to avoid contact with people who suffer from serious mental illness? Many people assume they need to avoid social contacts and activities if they are concerned about someone's mental health. While this may be appropriate in some cases, this approach should only be applied when it is necessary for an individual. For example, if you live near an elementary school where there is a history of mental health problems within the community, you do not want to stay at home every day. However, avoiding friends and relatives of those affected by serious mental illness can make matters worse because such people tend to isolate themselves. Also, being alone makes it more difficult to seek help, which can affect quality of life.

Q18. I have heard that the primary treatment for MS is a type of immune cell called an antibody. How long can this be effective? Answer:

The ability to control multiple sclerosis with a single type of antibody may not last very long, especially if it's used too often or at high doses. If you're using more than one type of immunotherapy drug together, your chances of controlling your symptoms will decrease over time because the antibodies are working in competition with each other and fighting off their own cells. Therefore, it would probably make sense to stop taking any new medications for about six months before trying another type.


If you think you might need additional doses of one or two different types of drugs, talk to your doctor about switching to a more targeted approach. You could try something like switching from one class of immunotherapy drug (such as infliximab) to another. The next step would be to gradually increase the dose of the first drug until you achieve complete remission after the second drug has stopped working. This process could take up to three years. After three years without flare-ups, your doctor may recommend continuing treatment with higher doses and/or combining treatments with another immunotherapy drug. For more information on the most common immunotherapies, read ""What Is Immunotherapy?"" [top] Q19. Which immunotherapy medications should I use if my disease doesn't respond to one or both of them? Answer:

Your doctors aren't sure what causes relapses of MS, so they don't know which drugs are best for everyone who responds to one medication. Sometimes the combination of two or more immunotherapies worked better than one at first, but then relapse occurred. In these cases, keep using all four drugs. However, some people respond better to only one or two immunotherapies. So, be sure to ask your doctor which ones you should avoid when starting or stopping treatment. Also, remember to check with your doctor if you start or stop treatment suddenly while under the influence of alcohol. A drug in your system can interfere with how the immune system works. Q20. What does relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis mean? Answer:

It means that you get a temporary reduction in your disability over several months, usually lasting one to two years. Then it starts back up again within days or weeks, usually causing more severe symptoms. When someone gets a partial response to a drug, it's referred to as remission. Once we've seen",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-0.2912498712539673,49,question,5,0.24873096446700507,414,6

Hypothyroidism and Thyrotoxicosis Symptoms

Many of the problems associated with hypothyroidism are due to overproduction of thyroid hormones. Hypothyroidism can lead to a variety of other conditions including obesity, heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, liver disease, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, sleep apnea, chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, joint pain, menstrual irregularities and even cancer. For this reason it is important that you take care when working out so as not to damage your body's cells and organs. Many people think that by exercising more they will get fat but there is no evidence that this is true. If the doctor thinks that you have hyperthyroidism then he or she may suggest that you try a thyroid medication which has been shown to work well in treating hyperthyroidism.

The thyroid hormone T4 has a half-life of 3 hours. This means that if you measure a serum level at 6 am on an average day you should be able to detect T4 levels for up to 4 days. The TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) level indicates how much T4 is being produced in your body. A normal TSH level is around 1.0 while an elevated one may indicate that there is too much T4 being made in your blood stream. It takes about two weeks before the TSH drops back down to its normal range. It is possible for some people to go through periods where their TSH goes high (over 2.5), however, this usually resolves itself within about three months.

When a person is diagnosed with hypothyroidism there are a number of tests which are done to check how well each part of the body is handling the hormone. These tests include thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FTO). Tests of these hormones show how well your body is handling both T3 and T4. If either test shows abnormally low levels the doctor may give the patient a prescription for either levothyroxine (a type of T4 medication) or triiodothyronine (T3) which both increase the production of T4 in the body.

To ensure that the medications prescribed to treat hypothyroidism do not affect your ability to become pregnant, there are several things you should know about. Your physician will perform a physical exam which includes checking your weight and height. They also ask questions regarding your diet and any allergies",123,hypothyroidism symptoms,-1.2669419050216677,15,question,5,0.09259259259259259,389,6

How to manage multiple sclerosis symptoms

This section explains the different ways to manage symptoms that are common with multiple sclerosis (MS). They include:

Using medications for pain relief and stiffness.

Managing other conditions such as headaches or depression.

Taking nutritional supplements.

If you have diabetes, talk with your doctor about reducing sugar intake.

The following tips apply in most cases but are not a substitute for seeking medical attention if needed.

Treatment goals

Although there is no cure for multiple sclerosis (MS), treatment is often very effective in controlling symptoms. The main goal of treatment is to relieve the signs of symptoms while slowing down the progression of the disease. This can be achieved by using medicines (including those listed below) or lifestyle changes. If severe, this may mean discontinuing treatments for several weeks or months at a time so that the immune system can return to its normal balance after relapse occurs. In extreme situations, however, discontinuation may be necessary.

Drugs

Most people who have MS respond well to one or two drugs. These range from medicine to exercise regimens that help reduce muscle spasms caused by inflammation. Depending on your condition and tolerance level, you should try several types of medication to find the best treatment strategy for you. Each type has a different side effect profile—for example, some may cause dizziness, while others may make it easier to walk—and each also provides certain benefits in reducing fatigue, increasing cognitive function, and improving sleep quality. You may need to repeat drug treatments when new symptoms arise because they may affect drug absorption through the gut. For more information, see Drug interactions.

Medication that affects nerve cells called myelin sheath Myelin sheath is an insulating layer that surrounds nerves throughout the body. It helps protect the nerve cells against damage and allows them to transmit signals between parts of the brain and spinal cord. When the myelin sheath is damaged, the signal sent between the brain and muscles is weakened. People with MS experience numbness or tingling in their legs, arms, hands, face, and feet. Some people feel weakness, paralysis, loss of bladder control, abnormal sensations in their ears, eyes, tongue, and throat, or difficulty breathing. Other problems include vision changes, hearing loss, and trouble swallowing.

Q: What is the relationship between MS and Parkinson's disease? Answer: Both are autoimmune diseases (autoimmune disorders result in immune system destruction of white blood cells). There may be some overlap in symptoms with age (age of onset) being important. Parkinson's disease typically has a younger age of onset than MS; however, MS often occurs at any age for which there is a positive family history, such as an affected parent. There are many similarities between these two conditions including neurodegeneration, inflammation, and myelin damage (as seen on magnetic resonance imaging or MRI), but it is also clear that both MS and PD can occur at different times in your life. Your doctor will have more questions to ask you about this topic. Q: My husband has MS and we recently learned he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease at the end of 2011. When does MS start and when do all other signs and symptoms begin to appear? Answer: As long as you continue to feel better and get a good night sleep, MS does not usually start until 3 years after you first notice a change in your pain, numbness, tingling, weakness or loss of movement in one area of your body. The last sign of MS generally appears 6 months to 2 years after the most recent onset of any symptom. If you experience any additional symptoms during your first few years after diagnosis you should contact your health care provider immediately. Q: I'm wondering if I am pregnant. Is there a way to test me for MS? Would the results help guide the diagnosis? A: It's possible to develop MS before having children. However, current treatment options don't offer much hope for preventing it from happening. Also, there aren't any tests available for detecting women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. This test would only pick up the risk of developing MS once you had kids. It wouldn't necessarily tell whether or not your child will eventually develop MS.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 1.5 million Americans, with over 100,000 new cases each year.[1] MS has been shown to be associated with sleep problems; for example, MS patients are reported to spend more time sleeping than other healthy persons, although they may also suffer from poor quality of sleep.[2] Sleep disorders are a risk factor for MS, but it is not clear whether these disorders contribute directly or indirectly to MS disease progression. Several studies have attempted to link MS with sleep disturbances by using subjective and objective tests of memory function.[3,4,5,6] However, no study has yet definitively linked MS to impaired cognitive performance. In addition, many aspects of MS, such as the number of lesions and extent of disability, have not been well understood when compared to normal aging. Therefore, our research group sought to examine possible relationships between these two characteristics.

Objective: To determine whether the presence of multiple sclerosis was associated with poorer performance on an abstract episodic verbal learning test (EVIDOL) among young adults without MS.

Design: A retrospective longitudinal survey including the use of EVIDOL, which provides a measure of declarative memory ability. The data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), followed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Linear regression analyses assessed associations between sleep variables and EVIDOL scores. Results are expressed as mean ± SD.

Results: Of the 24 participants, 21 had MS; 10 did not know they had MS. Compared with those who had MS, those without MS performed significantly worse on EVIDOL tests at baseline (P =.02); however, there was no significant difference between their average scores at baseline and following 3 months of treatment. There was no relationship between EVIDOL scores before and after treatment.

Q&A: What is the difference between the vaccine and the drug that's being given? A vaccine is a medicine made from living organisms. The ingredients in a vaccine are not harmful to you or your child. It can be dangerous when used incorrectly. For example, some medicines may weaken the immune system of children who've been vaccinated. Some vaccines contain live viruses. If this happens, it could lead to serious illness, even death. It also is possible that some infections caused by the virus in the vaccine may cause problems in someone who has no immunity to them. In most cases, however, these reactions have happened only after the person had already developed an infection.

Why should I get the flu shot?

The vaccine protects against two types of influenza virus. The ""live"" kind makes you sick (fever) if you come into contact with it. The ""inactivated"" version causes fewer symptoms but lasts longer in your body. You may feel better right away, but then your fever will return. This is normal. However, if you think you're getting sick from the vaccine (or any medication), call your doctor right away.

Who shouldn't get the flu vaccine?

Influenza infection is extremely rare. There were about 3 million cases of seasonal influenza reported during 2012. Of those, an estimated 48,000 people died. These figures do not include deaths that occurred before the season began, so there is little evidence that getting the flu shot would make you more likely to die of pneumonia, pneumonia-like illness (PELI), influenza-related complications, nor flu-associated hospitalization or death. Getting vaccinated does not protect against these diseases.

What is the recommended age to receive the flu vaccine?

You need to be at least 6 months old to get the flu vaccine. Children younger than 5 years of age should receive one dose of the flu vaccine as part of their routine vaccination schedule. All children aged 11 through 65 years who are hospitalized or receiving medical care for influenza should receive a second dose of the vaccine within 10 days of discharge or hospitalization. Flu shots are usually administered at least 72 hours after exposure to influenza.

How long does the flu vaccine stay in my body?

Vaccines typically last up to 8 weeks; the peak time for protection is 2–4 weeks later. People should check their immunizations each year to see how they're doing.

gpt2-xl_79,"Yes, MS can be passed from parent to child.\r

MS causes a breakdown of the immune system in the brain and spinal cord, which may affect how it affects the body's ability to fight infections. This means that even if you do not have MS yourself, you may have an increased chance of developing MS later on or having a severe form of the disease. In fact, there are genetic mutations known as ""seropositivity"" that increase your risk for developing MS. A person who has one such mutation is considered seronegative, meaning their immune systems are unable to produce antibodies against their own tissues. They will still need protection from viruses and bacteria in order to prevent infection, but they cannot effectively fight off MS. There is also evidence that suggests that children with one of these genes have higher rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) later in life, though this remains controversial.[1]\r

The following guidelines should help families understand why they shouldn't assume someone else has MS unless they're very sure:

Don't rely only on symptoms. If someone tells you they've experienced some sort of symptom (such as numbness, tingling, weakness), don't automatically assume they must be having MS. Other conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure, often cause similar symptoms. Also, don't assume someone has been diagnosed with MS just because of what's listed on the medical record. Most physicians aren't aware that MS even exists. When people tell me about how they're feeling, they're usually describing something completely different than MS. For example, someone might say they feel tired but still want to go out, while others might simply think they're ""sick."" Don't let assumptions lead you astray either; many illnesses make the same symptoms look very different.[2] \r

Watch for signs of MS. Symptoms include fatigue, depression, difficulty concentrating, and blurred vision. Even if you believe MS isn't affecting them, be cautious about drawing conclusions about the condition based solely on those symptoms. Some people have no symptoms at all. Others are able to work full time despite having problems sleeping or focusing. And then there are people whose illness impacts every aspect of their lives. Take note of changes in behavior that could indicate MS, such as unexplained absences, loss of appetite, or poor concentration.[3] \r

Case #1: A 69-year old man presented to our hospital with progressive urinary incontinence. His symptoms were persistent and severe, leading him to see his urologist. On history, the patient reported that for 10 years he had been taking diclofenac as an antiemetic (a medication used to treat nausea). The drug was discontinued by his physician in 2007 because it caused abdominal pain when taken regularly. He took diclofenac daily until 2009 or 2010 before returning to his previous dosage. After 3 months of discontinuation, the patient complained of back pain and began seeking treatment at another hospital center. In January 2011, the patient's physical examination revealed evidence of bladder trauma including a small tear of the bladder wall. Urine output decreased from 8 to 2 ml/day and the patient noted that he felt ""hot"". He continued to take diclofenac without incident. Two weeks later the patient developed a right upper quadrant mass on computed tomography (CT) scan. Biopsies obtained from this mass showed numerous periosteal infiltrates; these were believed to be benign. Subsequent pathology testing identified lymphoid malignancy and carcinoma in situ. On surgical excision of the bladder, two additional masses were discovered, one of which was adenocarcinoma of the left colon (CIN2-3) and the other of bladder dysplasia (BPD). Both of these tumors were resected and biopsy results indicated their presence. All tumors were removed surgically on February 15, 2011. Following surgery, patients urine output increased rapidly while they remained within normal limits. At follow up three months after surgery, urine output was nearly normal except for mild decrease in volume (7 ml/day), similar to what was observed before surgery. Thereafter, on March 16, 2011, urine output remained within normal limits. By June 5, 2011, there appeared to have been no further change in function (physical exam, laboratory analysis) for 6 months after surgery. On June 20, 2011, biopsies were performed for CIN2-3 and BPD. Urine outputs did not change over time despite continuing treatment with diclofenac. One month prior to surgery, the patient said he had started using marijuana to alleviate back and pelvic pain.

My guess is not so good as to say that Dr. Oz is lying or misrepresenting his information, but it's just that he may be unaware that he has been doing something wrong at least with respect to what he has done as an expert commentator on health matters.

Lying down with your feet on the floor (or something similar) hold onto a wall or table. Keep your back straight while keeping your arms out in front of you like you're holding an umbrella. Don't push them forward at all! Keeping your head level allows us to keep our shoulders relaxed. Now relax your shoulders fully. You can really stretch the long head area by doing this exercise. When you reach full range of motion, go back up. Repeat 2-3 times then repeat 3 more times. At first, it may feel hard, but after about 30 seconds you'll notice that you can do this with ease. Do not try to move too fast here. Relaxing your shoulder muscles takes time, so just be patient. Go through each repetition slowly at first until you feel comfortable with it. Once you get to the point where you can comfortably do one movement without any discomfort, start moving faster again. As long as your body feels good when you're stretching, you should not have to stop at any point during your practice. If anything, I'd recommend going even harder if you want to make sure your muscles stay stretched and healthy throughout the day.


As an added bonus, this exercise is great for preventing injuries. Your muscles take over after a few days, allowing you to work harder and longer than before.


Sit on the edge of your bed or couch, facing away from the door, knees bent. Tuck your chin into your chest and let your elbows rest on the backs of your thighs. Reach toward your right hand. Feel how loose your muscles are now? Good. Push yourself forward as high as you can by reaching with your left hand. Hold for 5 minutes and then release. Practice this every other day.


A version of this exercise uses your lower abdomen. Sit on the edge of a chair. Stand behind you and raise your torso off the ground by bending down slightly. Lift both legs above your hips and extend both arms parallel to the floor towards the ceiling. Lower the body back down once it's almost at your knees. That's the general idea.


Take a deep breath in, then exhale completely. Hold it and return to normal breathing technique.

Stage 5 metastatic lung cancer outcomes\nAnswer: yes

A study involving 13,895 patients who underwent surgery for advanced cancer at 12 centers in the United States and Canada reported that when compared with a group of patients without lung cancer, those treated with pembrolizumab had lower rates of death from all causes, other cancers combined (except non-Hodgkin lymphoma), respiratory disease (except asthma) or malignant neoplasms, as well as an increased likelihood of achieving remission. In addition, pembrolizumab was associated with reduced time to relapse. A second phase III trial will investigate whether pembrolizumab is also effective in patients who have failed standard therapy.

gpt2-xl_96,"a vegetarian diet (sustainable in terms of food resources).

I asked the question above because I have heard that vegetarians are more likely to be overweight. However, what I found curious is that although this might seem like a very common assumption given what we hear about how much meat people eat, there actually is not enough evidence to support it. The best studies suggest no difference between the two groups (for example, here or here). Another study showed vegetarians had lower cholesterol than omnivores (see here), but again there was only weak evidence for these differences being due to the difference in dietary fat intake between vegetarians and omnivores. Another paper from Sweden suggested that the benefits of higher red-meat consumption were outweighed by increased risks of cardiovascular disease and cancer (here). While this is certainly interesting, my suspicion is that the effect is probably related to other factors rather than having anything to do with how much meat you eat. This includes the fact that those on low-fat diets tend to also eat more meat. And even if they did eat less, I don't think it would matter in terms of weight gain.

The bottom line

For me, the issue at hand is whether the high amount of meat consumed leads to an unhealthy diet, which is why I recommend following a vegetarian diet and not simply eating fewer processed foods. If your main goal is health then the answer seems clear – follow a vegetarian diet. But if your primary goal is weight loss, then it's important to understand that as long as the majority of your diet consists of vegetables and fruits, you should find that this won't lead to weight gain.

And here's another thing… in some cases a vegetarian diet can actually help prevent obesity. For example, one study in Finland showed that when children in a group switched from their traditional dinner of pork sausages and potato chips to a fish sandwich with bread and lettuce every night for three weeks, they lost twice as much weight as the control group did (1).

""Psychological"" \, is defined as any mental process or state other than those resulting from physical causes, but including (but not limited to) thought processes and perceptions, memory, personality, personality traits, attitudes, behaviors, emotions, etc. Psychology is the branch of sociology concerned with the study of human behavior. It deals with all aspects of how people think, feel, behave, make decisions, perceive, remember, remember, etc.. The term ""psychology"" was first used by Francis Galton in 1852 when he used the word to refer specifically to mental science. In addition to this use by Galton, the word has been popularly applied to non-physical phenomena such as psychophysiology, neurophysiology, biophysics, psychiatry, neurology, behavioral medicine, social psychology, psychology, cognitive neuroscience, neuroeconomics, cognitive ethology, evolutionary biology, evolutionary psychology, and so forth. By the way, the last one means that the word's definition varies according to whether you're talking about evolution or something else entirely. For example, some scientists see the word evolution as referring exclusively to biological changes; others argue that it can be applied to whatever process produces new species, regardless of its genetic origins. I'll leave it up to your imagination if you want to define the terms ""psychology"", ""behavioral economics"", ""neuroeconomics"", and/or ""behavioral research"".

So, basically, what does an individual therapist do? Well, we don't actually have a great deal of information, because therapy is very much a ""black box."" We still know very little about it. Some therapists may be involved in more than one type of therapy. However, most therapists will only treat a single type of problem at a time. We often hear of patients who are treated for different issues using the same therapist. That is just not true. You must understand why before you try to work through the ""mental health"" problems yourself. Most therapists specialize in working on specific problems, sometimes dealing with multiple types of problems simultaneously. This can lead to confusion. What works for one person may not work for another. And most therapists who specialize in particular areas cannot tell you anything about working on problems outside their area of expertise.

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects more than 200 million people in the United States and roughly 32 million worldwide.1\ nDisease-related complications include blindness, nerve damage, kidney failure, amputations, heart attacks, strokes, and nerve damage.2 While diabetes is not a common condition, it causes significant morbidity and mortality among individuals with type 1 or 2 diabetes.3

The American Diabetes Association defines diabetes as an autoimmune disorder characterized by insulin resistance, which occurs when cells cannot produce enough of their own glucose to meet the body's needs for energy.4 Insulin resistance leads to high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) and frequent urination and weight loss.5\ nDietary modification is necessary if you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes to prevent long-term complications.6

People with type 1 or type 2 diabetes may develop hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), but they should not go into shock because this usually happens only in patients whose blood sugars are elevated beyond normal.7 In contrast, patients who have untreated type 1 diabetes often experience hypoglycemia at some point during the day when their blood sugar level drops below 95 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L).8 The onset of hypoglycemia usually starts after meals and develops gradually over several hours.9 Hypoglycemia is commonly associated with rapid eye movements (REM) or drowsiness, which occur when blood sugar levels remain too low.10 Hypoglycemia also has been reported in elderly persons with no known underlying cause, and it is linked with other medical conditions such as stroke, peripheral vascular disease, or myocardial infarction.11 If your symptoms persist despite controlling your blood sugar levels, see your physician immediately.

Diagnosis

If you suspect you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, seek immediate care from your doctor or a health care professional. Your doctor will determine if you have diabetes, evaluate your current medications and treatment plan, order laboratory tests, and perform physical exams. Blood pressure and body mass index measurements can help identify abnormalities such as hypertension (high blood pressure), obesity, and cardiovascular risk factors.

A thorough history is crucial because many medical conditions may coexist with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.12 Certain family members may also have diabetes. These people may need regular monitoring of blood sugar levels to monitor their progress toward better control.

gpt2-xl_119,"The first question that comes to mind is probably the most common and has been asked thousands of times by people around the world. In fact, it's so common that many of you will have experienced this as well. You are asleep and suddenly find yourself with a terrible, stabbing, burning or ache in your neck. You know what's going on because you've felt it before – the ""neck pain"" you feel when your head turns and you can't move it! And yet it doesn't go away no matter how hard you try to loosen up your muscles and relax them. It feels like someone is twisting a knife into your neck. I'd say 95% of people who experience neck pain report it starts with some type of tightness in their neck (e.g., neck rolls) but eventually turns into something more severe such as pain that radiates through the whole body. So why do we tend to fall for these ""neck pain"" stories? Many factors contribute to how our brains create these perceptions about our own bodies. But one factor that plays an important role is our sense of smell.


What causes neck pain?

As mentioned above, the reason our necks hurt seems to be linked to our ability to breathe while we sleep. Our airways become constricted and we then start to inhale, pushing food and other items down deeper into our lungs. This can cause pressure within the chest cavity (known as pneumothorax), which is characterized by deep breathing. The result is increased blood loss and sometimes even death. Of course, this isn't always caused by breathlessness and we often think it happens just after we wake up from sleeping. However, we know that the problem is much worse than just having trouble breathing during sleep, especially if we also suffer chronic low back pain.

How does this happen? First, let's take a look at how our brain perceives the sensation of breathing and the airway. As you're lying there, your entire body is completely relaxed. Your face might seem slightly flushed, and your heart rate may be somewhere between 100-120 beats per minute. Breathing itself may actually be quite pleasant and rhythmic, but the way our brains interpret this sensation of relaxation depends upon whether our senses are active or not. If we can see another person in an empty room, they are almost certainly alive and therefore appear awake. When we watch TV or listen to music, we cannot tell whether someone is sleeping or awake and we therefore assume they are still breathing normally.",119,best pillow neck pain,-8.58626937866211,89,question,5,0.5266272189349113,429,6

Q7. If I have a cough and/or sore throat, do I need to be worried?

A7. Yes, you should keep an eye on it. If the wheezing or difficulty breathing persists for more than two days, see your doctor.


Q8. What if I'm having trouble breathing while sleeping?

A8. This is usually due to a blocked airway and may indicate that something is wrong with your lungs. Your breath may feel like it's coming in very fast or slow; it may seem as though you can't take deep breaths at all (even when you try); you may experience shortness of breath even when you're lying down; and you could have trouble with swallowing. These are typical signs of a respiratory infection which will require further tests and possibly surgery. The best way to help you sleep is to make sure you've got plenty of rest so your body has time to heal and recover. See our article about how to get some good quality sleep.


Q9. How long does it take my body to adjust to a new medication?

A9. A lot depends on the drugs and other medications you take. Sometimes people start taking one drug and then another within a few months. It takes several weeks before you really become ""used"" to a new medicine. For example, you'll probably notice less pain after starting to use a medicine called ibuprofen, but you may not feel better right away. It also takes weeks for your body to accept the effect of a new drug such as pyrimethamine, so you should continue to avoid using these medicines during this process.


Q10. Do I need to change anything else about my diet or exercise routine?

A10. Not unless you want to. You don't necessarily need to stop smoking completely. There's no evidence that quitting smoking reduces the risk of heart disease or stroke. In fact, in a study published in 2006, researchers found that smokers who quit had a higher rate of death from all causes compared to those who continued their habit. Smoking cessation programs offer many benefits to people trying to quit smoking, including increased rates of smoking-cessation success in terms of fewer cigarettes smoked per day, greater reductions in lung cancer deaths, and decreased likelihood of relapsing and continuing to smoke. Other lifestyle changes include increasing physical activity levels and limiting alcohol intake. See our page on tobacco control for more information.

There is a way of measuring if your immune system has been working properly. The term cytokinesis means the ""messenger molecules"" involved. These cytokines release chemicals called substances into our bloodstreams which cause disease symptoms or inflammation. There are two types of cytokines which play a role in relapsing MS. These are interleukins (IL) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa). IL is produced by white blood cells known as B lymphocytes. TNFa is produced by white blood cells called macrophages. Other factors such as the brain stem cell population can also produce these mediators.

gpt2-xl_77,"The two disorders are not related. In fact, the majority of women who develop MS are diagnosed with a history of PMS or premenstrual syndrome (PMS). This is because both conditions tend to resolve on their own within 3-5 years after they begin.

The link between premenstrual syndrome and PMS has been known for some time; however, it was recently demonstrated that this association may be causal in patients with either condition. The mechanism behind this connection is unknown but could involve changes in levels of hormones affecting the brain during pregnancy. A similar hypothesis also exists regarding the relationship between PMS and Alzheimer's disease (AD), where there is now evidence that women who have premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are more likely than normal women to have AD later in life. It should be noted, however, that although these studies show an association between premenstrual dysphoric disorder and AD, it does not prove causation.

In contrast to the studies showing causation, other studies show no relationship between the two conditions. For example, one large study found that nearly all premenopausal women had low estrogen levels at baseline. By the end of the six month period of testing, only 35% of participants reported any type of change in hormone levels. Thus, the research shows that premenstrual dysphoric disorder does not directly cause PMS; rather, high estrogen levels appear to increase depression and irritability in those affected by PMS.[3]

Another possibility for why symptoms do not correlate closely with each other is due to differences in age at onset of symptoms. Women who experience PMS before menarche start experiencing the first signs of the menstrual cycle. Therefore, the presence of symptoms earlier in the menstrual cycle can confuse the issue as to whether the symptoms are due to premenstrual syndrome. However, when symptoms arise later in the menstrual cycle, it can make them much easier to distinguish from symptoms associated with PMS. One study investigated over 100 women with PMS and found that the majority experienced symptoms prior to menarche. When asked to distinguish between premenstrual symptoms and PMS, most did so correctly.[4]

How much does it cost to get well?

The average annual cost of health care in the United States was $9,076 per person in 2013. The U.S. government estimates that the lifetime costs of treating all medical expenses will exceed $1 trillion.[1][2] In 2010, Medicare paid for $7.8 billion of health care services provided by doctors and hospitals.[3] Physicians are also responsible for more than three-quarters of healthcare expenditures.[4] In addition to paying for their own personal medical treatment, physicians often receive payment from insurance companies to perform procedures like hip replacements, knee replacement surgeries, cancer chemotherapy treatments, and dental work. Physicians and other healthcare providers can earn hundreds of thousands of dollars annually through fees for procedures and treatments they provide.[5][6] It is estimated that, on average, an office visit with a physician costs more than $100, but patients pay only about 10 percent of those costs.[6] Although many people believe that health insurance protects them against financial hardship due to unexpected medical bills, few people know how much money insurers actually reimburse doctors who treat certain conditions, including those related to chronic diseases.[7] This means that for every dollar Americans spend on health insurance premiums each year, roughly one-fifth goes toward medical expenses that are not covered by employer-sponsored coverage.[7] According to the Kaiser Family Foundation,",1,What are the most common chronic diseases?

It works great and can help you lose weight and keep your blood sugar levels stable while giving you all the benefits of a healthy low-carbohydrate diet without any of the harmful side effects associated with traditional diabetes diets.

Q&A on Carbohydrates and Diabetes \nQuestion: What about carbohydrates in my carb-rich foods such as candy bars and sweets? Can I eat those foods? Answer: You may be able to eat sugar free or reduced calorie candies but most candies contain carbohydrate and some have added sugar. In general, it is best not to consume high amounts of glucose in excess of 100 grams per day (100 g = approximately 6 oz.). This will increase insulin sensitivity, which increases the risk of diabetes. For more information, please visit our page on dietary guidelines for diabetics. Q&A on Carbohydrates and Diabetes Q&A with Dr. Robert Lustig, MD Question: My doctor suggested that I reduce my daily carbs from 45 grams to 25 grams after eating pizza at a restaurant recently. However, when I ate the same amount of pizza the next night I had no problems getting full afterwards. Should this advice apply to everyone who eats pizza regularly? Answer: The lower you go with your carbohydrate intake the better it will work. You should try to find ways to get less than 35 grams of carbohydrate on any given day - usually eaten between lunch and dinner. Keep in mind that every time you take one bite of your favorite food, you are also taking away another bite. To minimize calories, always choose lean meats, vegetables, nuts, seeds, avocado, and whole grains. Q&A on Carbohydrates and Diabetes

gpt2-xl_97,"benefits of physical exercise\n

Q. What does the word ""exercise"" mean? A. Exercise is a physical activity that has been proven to improve health and fitness levels, and can be performed at any age or stage of life. Exercising may be done by yourself, with friends and family, in the comfort of your own home or elsewhere. It may also include activities such as yoga and Pilates classes. Physical exercise improves cardiovascular (blood vessel) function; increases muscular strength and endurance; lowers blood pressure; reduces stress and anxiety; and boosts brain power.


How much physical activity do I need to get the most benefit from my exercise program? A. If you're healthy and exercising regularly, the best way to achieve good health is to increase your daily physical activity level. To maintain your weight loss success while trying to lose fat, it's important to ensure that your daily physical activity level is maintained throughout the whole process. An easy way to keep track of your daily activity and progress is through our Fitbit Activity Tracker. This tracker monitors your steps taken each day, and gives you an estimate of how many more calories you'll burn if you spend one hour on each step than if you walk for the same time. Using a Fitbit Activity Tracker will help you make informed decisions about what kind of activity to undertake when you want to reach new goals and see them become achievable. The Fitbit app for iPhone® helps you set and monitor your daily exercise goal on your phone so you don't have to carry around a separate device and remember to update it every morning. It also provides reminders of the next steps toward reaching your target amount of daily exercise. You can use your Fitbit devices as a daily reminder and reminder system, too. For example, you could use the Fitbit Alta™ wristband as a countdown timer for walking your dog or another activity of choice. The Fitbit Charge HR wristband also lets you know when you should take a break from your workouts because you've run out of energy.


Do I really need to eat every 2 hours to meet my physical activity requirement? A. No. Your body needs regular bursts of food intake and breaks during your exercise routines to replenish needed nutrients and repair damaged muscle tissue. Eating plenty of nutritious foods before and after you workout will help keep you energized as you go along - especially if you like to snack! However, just eating enough food won't give you the extra energy boost you need to stay active long term.

Question: is it important to hydrate more often than not when training for an event such as marathon, half marathon or ultra?\nAnswer: yes! (1) Drink more fluids before, during and after workouts. (2) Take lots of electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium and chloride. (3) When exercising and sweating, try to drink 1-2 glasses per hour. Water and sports drinks are the best choices because they keep you hydrated and satisfy other nutritional needs.


Questions: What should I do if my muscles hurt more than usual?\nAnswer: start at least one day prior to an upcoming workout and go easy on them until they feel normal again. Also try to avoid heavy lifting (squats, deadlifts, bench presses, etc…) for a few days. Don't forget to use stretching as well. Your muscles need some time to rest between workouts so give them plenty of space to heal.

Q: can a woman with psoriasis be pregnant? Answer: Yes

A: The question was unclear because it did not specify whether the psoriasis is primary or secondary. In general, we will accept a diagnosis of ""primary"" psoriasis if the patient has more than one type of skin lesion (eg, psoriatic arthritis and erythema nodosum) as well as significant weight loss or anorexia nervosa. [3] Secondary psoriasis occurs in about 1% to 5% of patients with psoriasis. Women who have no history of pregnancy are at higher risk for developing secondary psoriasis due to their elevated levels of testosterone.[4]

Question: does this disease affect male reproductive organs? Answer: no

There may be some indirect evidence that psoriasis affects male fertility, but the studies were limited by small sample sizes, lack of control groups, use of different diagnostic criteria, and/or short follow-up periods. For example, in a study conducted among 40 women with chronic plaque psoriasis, none had been pregnant, while all reported being breastfeeding, which suggests there might be a link between psoriasis and reproduction.[5] A case report suggests that steroid supplementation could delay the time to onset of infertility and reduce the severity of psoriasis lesions. However, most women in the study stopped taking steroids after stopping treatment, so further research is needed to confirm these findings.

Question: what is psoralen used for? Answer: psoralens are prescribed for the relief of itching from a variety of causes, including acute flushing reactions such as those seen following exposure to strong irritants. They also are sometimes given for mild cases of generalized rashes like eczema and contact dermatitis associated with allergies (contact urticaria). Patients with severe psoralen side effects include those with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; they must discontinue therapy immediately.[6] Psoralen is a highly effective drug in treating pruritus caused by stinging insects. It works by inhibiting histamine release by mast cells, resulting in decreased itchiness. Although this drug can cause drowsiness, many people report feeling energized after taking it.

Question: how do I stop taking my psoralen? Answer: you should change your medication to another medication that is less likely to cause unwanted side effects.

gpt2-xl_98,"Pelvic Organ Prolapse (PO) Pelvic organ prolapse is the abnormal position of a woman's pelvic organs. The term was coined by Drs. H.G. Brown and J.L. Williams after a patient with pelvic organ prolapse who had been treated for bladder cancer complained that her symptoms were similar to those of an ectopic pregnancy. In this type of POC, the uterus moves into a more normal position within the pelvis and can become stuck or displaced.


If you notice any signs of pelvic organ prolapse you should see your gynecologist as soon as possible to avoid serious damage.


A prolapsed uterus may cause cramping, pain in the lower abdomen, abdominal distention, or swelling in the vagina. Symptoms include severe pain in the lower back or lower abdomen, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, tenderness/swelling of one side of the abdomen, heavy vaginal bleeding, and urinary urgency.


In cases where there are no other causes for pelvic organ prolapse the following test may be helpful in diagnosis of POC: ""can a fistula exist between the urethra and the external genitalia?""


""can a perforation occur within the cervix?""


(if so - please call us at 800-452-4453 immediately!)


and


""can a large uterine blood vessel be seen protruding from the vulva?""


Your doctor may recommend further testing and treatment if these tests are positive. If not, then the only option available to treat PO is surgery: surgical removal of the ovary, fallopian tube, and uterus. These procedures will be performed under general anesthesia and usually require two or three days recovery time. After surgery, follow up visits will allow for monitoring of your progress. Once again, consult your primary care physician before making any significant changes in your medication regimen.


Another complication that can occur during treatment of PO is a peritonitis. This condition occurs when bacteria enter the uterus causing an infection (usually bacterial vaginosis) which causes inflammation or pain during intercourse, menstruation, or childbirth. A good rule of thumb is to check with your doctor every 6 months whether or not your PO has returned.

gpt2-xl_63,"Multiple sclerosis is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions affecting people worldwide. It affects an estimated 1 in 200 Americans and over 3,000 people per year in Canada. The disease causes severe disability and loss of mobility, which may result in a reduced quality of life for affected individuals. In addition to debilitating physical symptoms (such as pain and numbness), MS patients are also at risk of significant emotional distress including depression, anxiety, social isolation, marital problems, family dysfunction, and mortality rates due to suicide or accidental death. Although there have been some encouraging developments with treatment advances for MS, there remain considerable barriers to effective treatment that limit their effectiveness. For example, about 50% of people diagnosed with MS still don't know they have the disorder. The lack of awareness has resulted in limited access to adequate care, delayed diagnosis, inadequate research, ineffective treatments, and other issues that make successful treatments difficult to deliver. It's not surprising that there remains skepticism regarding treatment options. Fortunately, researchers continue to discover new ways to treat MS and advance our understanding of the condition. This will help improve the lives of those living with MS by allowing them to live more independent and productive lifestyles while reducing the need for costly interventions that are associated with adverse side effects. There are several clinical trials underway to provide promising results on potential therapies that can reduce brain inflammation and protect neurons from damage caused by MS. If approved, these therapies could greatly impact the lives of millions of people across the globe.

Q. What is the probability of developing MS?

A. It depends on age. The risk increases as you get older, until it peaks at 30 years old and then falls off dramatically. For example, in a study of 11,000 people with average age of 40, there was one incident case of MS per 100,000 person-years. In another study involving almost 20,000 people, there were 1,300 cases per 100,000 person-years. An estimate of the number of new MS patients in the United States during the 1990s is 3 million to 5 million.

gpt2-xl_54,"Multiple sclerosis is a disease that damages the myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells. Myelin is what protects and insulates our nerves, so this damage can lead to paralysis or even death from complications.

MS causes inflammation of the brain and spinal cord (called demyelination). This leads to loss of electrical signals between cells in the central nervous system. Symptoms range from mild symptoms like numbness and tingling around your body, such as hands and feet, to more severe ones like progressive muscle weakness, vision problems, hearing changes and difficulty speaking.

In most cases, MS can be diagnosed by taking a blood test that measures levels of certain chemicals called antibodies to try to determine whether you have antibodies to MS. Some people may also need an MRI scan of their head to look at lesions caused by the autoimmune process of MS. The cause of MS is unknown. It's believed that genetic factors are involved, although studies have shown no link between genes and MS.

Some treatments for MS, such as steroids and immune-suppressing drugs, help reduce symptoms, but there's no cure. Treatment doesn't work for everyone. And some types of MS — particularly those with longer duration and/or worse progression than other forms of the condition — do not respond well to treatment. Although there isn't enough evidence to say one way or another which patients will benefit or suffer the worst outcome, research suggests that if you're affected by MS, early detection and treatment is probably worth considering. You'll still want to discuss potential side effects of any treatments with your doctor before starting them.

gpt2-xl_52,"The major problem is that many people have no idea how to identify and treat any of these issues. This leads to a lack of understanding, which in turn makes it harder for us all to work together as a community. To help you understand what these disorders are and what causes them, here is a list of nine common mental health disorders.

1. Depression

What's the cause of depression? If you look at the brain, one thing you will see is significant amounts of gray matter. Gray matter means information processing power. Think about your brain and its ability to process information. It uses up energy trying to make sense of everything, making decisions about whether or not something needs to be done. As we age, this gray matter shrinks. But because our brains don't stop growing, they still use up energy even when there isn't much happening in the world around us. When this gray matter is smaller than normal, it doesn't have enough room to do anything. In fact, the brain does not have enough space to store new memories. For example, if you were to lose a friend with Alzheimer's disease, your brain would likely remember some details from that person but could not actually create new ones—you might find yourself wondering where he was and why he left so suddenly. However, by losing those old memories (they aren't stored), you become able to access new memory traces. Therefore, even though we lose our friends, we are able to gain new ones through our memories. The result is that we can experience things like grief without feeling empty inside. While depression has been known to affect almost everyone at times, it tends to affect young adults the hardest. Researchers believe that the stress of having to move away from home and school plays into depression. That's because moving to a different place creates a lot of change in someone's life. It also changes their routines—it's hard for them to maintain friendships and relationships with the same group of people for extended periods. Also, studies show that women tend to suffer more from depression compared to men. Women spend longer hours at work and school, and they may miss out on family time. They're less social with other women; they have fewer close female friends and may stay silent about feelings of sadness and loneliness. Finally, the effects of living alone seem to play into depression. Many older women struggle with depression just as much as younger females. Those who live alone are often expected to take care of themselves, while others must rely upon others for emotional support. And research shows",52,What are the most common mental health problems?

All of these treatments have their place, but they can be combined into one holistic approach.

Q: How does the government fund this program?

A: The federal government funds most of the research work on these various programs, including studies related to homeopathy. For example, there has been research demonstrating that some forms of homeopathic remedies may help reduce symptoms of heart disease. As well, a study funded by Health Canada indicated that certain homeopathic preparations might provide short-term relief from pain caused by osteoarthritis, while others might even prevent damage to joints.

The Federal/Provincial/Territorial Government Programs

Homeopathic care is available through federally funded clinics under the National Homeopathic Health Program administered by Health Canada. Some provinces also pay for complementary practitioners' services if they offer homeopathy as part of their practice (eg Saskatchewan). These payments are generally based on the percentage of money spent on homeopathic medications in comparison with conventional drugs. Most provincial governments are not paying for homeopathic physicians who take clients out of their own system.

In addition to funding the national homeopathic health program, the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care provides support for complementary therapy providers in Ontario via the Ontario Integrative Health Association. In 2006, approximately $1.4 million was provided annually for the association ($5 million over 5 years) to promote homeopathic treatment to seniors, students at the University of Toronto and people living with HIV/AIDS.

Healthy People 2020 promotes integrated approaches to health care. By working together, Canadians will achieve greater access to quality health care options, and ensure that we continue to protect and strengthen our public systems against threats such as infectious diseases, malnutrition and obesity. Healthy People 2020 recognizes the need to improve communication about complementary therapies among health professionals, parents, consumers and policy makers.

Question: a diagnosis of Hypothyroidism by blood work or urine analysis. Answer: Bloodwork, urinalysis, and a complete physical examination is recommended to diagnose Hypothyroidism, but is not required to make an initial diagnosis. The following criteria must be met before using any of these tests as part of an initial evaluation: 1) Thyroid hormones levels need to be measured within 3 months after starting medication; 2) thyroid function tests (T4, T3) should have been performed at least once every 6 months for three consecutive years prior to the start of treatment; 3) TSH should range between 0.2-0.5 mIU/L with an upper limit of 4.0 mIU/L. If these requirements are met, then all thyroid medications including levothyroxine may be started without further testing. For more information please contact your Doctor.

Question: how can I know whether my doctor has an interest in treating me with Low T? Answer: In general doctors who treat patients with low thyroid function are well educated about this condition. They will often ask you questions concerning how much thyroid hormone therapy you are taking, whether you are currently taking additional thyroid hormone replacement products, and what other conditions you might be experiencing that may be associated with low thyroid function such as depression.

Question: My physician states I am only mildly Hypothyroid according to his test results which says 'Normal'. Is this a correct diagnosis? Answer: Most clinicians use two different types of thyroid test to determine your level of Hypothyroidism. One type measures free thyroids in serum using a PTH assay. This gives an indication of the number of free thyroids present. A second test (also called a nuclear receptor binding antibody), uses antibodies specific to thyroid receptors in your body to measure a protein known as Free T4 or Free T3.

If your levels of Free T4 or Free T3 are under 15% of normal you probably have insufficient T4 activity. Treatment with prednisone will reduce T4 levels while increasing T3 levels to increase bone density.

Question: How did you manage depression while living with ADHD? Did your family support you through the ups and downs of life?

a) Yes. Our entire family is very supportive of us and has done everything possible to help make sure we stay well. It's hard to explain just what a blessing it is having an ADHD-affected parent around, because it makes things easier for everyone involved! But we've all learned to cope more effectively, to say what we need to say with less hesitation or worry. We're lucky to live in such an open-minded society where there is no stigma attached to any mental health issue.

My Answer to this Question was as Follows (Please note: This answer does NOT include answers to questions #2 to #4):

a) There was nothing better than spending time with friends who were also affected by ADHD. One particular friend from high school actually had a diagnosis of ADD. She made it her mission to share her story and to inspire other kids to seek out assistance with their own challenges. It was a wonderful experience!

I think it might work! I'll start with a quick review.

How do they work?

First let me describe two types of contacts (and their benefits) as far as I can remember.

A) Contact lens solution (conventional), which is usually applied via a syringe.

B) Prescription contact lens solution (pharmaceutical grade). This is used by opticians who have expertise in optical diagnosis. It contains both the drug that prevents damage caused by UV rays and the ""binder"" substance that forms the contacts. The drug slows down the absorption process of ultraviolet radiation. It also helps improve the vision-friendly coating inside the lens. In addition, there is a small amount of anti-reflective material added for better refractive accuracy.

Prescription lenses work by diffusing excess UV rays; conventional contacts diffuse only visible light. Because of this, they offer improved visibility under normal circumstances, and some people prefer conventional contacts over prescription ones because they may appear less distracting.

Since prescription lenses are not necessary for day-to-day use, they cost more than the regular frames. They are also not suitable for all individuals – some people find the prescription lenses uncomfortable. That's why I personally recommend using prescriptions, especially if you already wear contacts.

There are some advantages to using a custom prescription frame. For example, you could easily order one made just for you, and then add your own frames, lenses or inserts. Of course, the cost would be higher, but once again, you're making your own choice.",127,glasses for computer,-8.633437156677246,21,question,6,0.3181818181818182,378,10
gpt2-xl_92,"There are a number of factors that can contribute to increased fatigue. The most common is the use of other medications that increase your risk of developing MS, such as anti-seizure medication or certain antidepressants. In addition, there may be genetic and/or environmental reasons for your symptoms (e.g., you have been exposed to high levels of toxins from tobacco smoke, chemical fumes etc.). There also seems to be an association between MS and a certain strain of bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) which is found on the skin (i.e., sores).


The reason we ask about fatigue is because fatigue is often associated with MS, but not always. Most people who have MS will experience some degree of fatigue at one time or another, especially when they start their treatment regimen. However, it's important to remember that MS doesn't cause fatigue; rather, fatigue happens in response to a variety of things going wrong with the body. Some illnesses can lead to symptoms that resemble MS, including: infections (such as S. aureus infection); inflammation caused by viruses or fungal infections; immune system suppression; autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis; chronic pain syndromes; thyroid conditions; malnutrition (especially if you are malnourished); and many others.


One of the best ways to decrease your chances of developing MS by increasing your energy level is to eat well and exercise regularly. A diet rich in vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, and other minerals (including potassium), along with regular physical activity are all recommended to promote healthy joints and muscles.


For those patients who do suffer from fatigue, our team here at Columbia University has developed a program designed specifically to help improve their quality of life.

Q53. Question: What is the treatment for multiple sclerosis?

A: Most doctors will start by starting a low dose steroid medicine called prednisone. Then they can gradually increase the dose as needed to help control the MS symptoms.

Q54. Question: How long does it take for my doctor to see me and how much does he/she pay attention to me while I'm being treated?

A: Your doctor has his/her own schedule. Many doctors do not work weekends because there are too many other patients on their busy schedules and that could make them late to your appointment. You can usually expect to be seen at least 2 times per week during the first 3 months after diagnosis.

The doctor may also ask you to fill out a health history form so they know more about you and if possible treat any conditions that might affect your care. In addition, the doctor should review your test results once a month to check for side effects and give you an update on treatment progress.

Some people find this information helpful when deciding whether to continue taking steroids.

Q55. Question: Can I return to school?

A: Yes, even though steroids have been used since the 1940s in treating multiple sclerosis. However, it's important to keep the medication in mind when you're thinking about returning to class. The steroids are often changed during the course of treatment, so it's important to get regular updates from your doctor.

After having had multiple sclerosis, you'll need more than just time off from physical activity and schooling. If your condition hasn't improved enough for you to resume full-time school, talk with your doctor about whether you would like to attend college or try an alternative method of education.

Q11: What are the different types of MS?

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in a brain region called the central nervous system (CNS), including the spinal cord. The term ""autoimmunity"" is usually used to describe how your body mounts an immune response against itself, rather than targeting a foreign substance such as bacteria or viruses.

In addition to the CNS, the immune system can also attack other areas of the body. These include the eyes, skin, joints, lungs, kidneys, liver, bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes and blood vessels. Other parts of the body may be affected by an immune reaction; therefore, it's important for you to know what is normal for your particular area before considering any changes.

The two main forms of MS are progressive MS and relapsing-remitting MS. Both forms have many overlapping symptoms, which makes it difficult to distinguish between them using standard tests. With progressive MS, your symptoms tend to get worse over time while they improve with treatment. Relapses happen when symptoms return.

About 1 in 10 people who experience recurrent attacks of MS eventually develop permanent damage to their nerve cells. Most often this occurs after the first episode of attacks; however, relapses happen frequently even among those who don't develop MS during childhood. In some cases, people who relapse develop long lasting problems in vision, hearing, movement, cognition, balance, bladder function and more.

A single-event MS can occur at any age. But if you develop symptoms within 12 months of another event, your risk of developing an episode increases rapidly. For example, one in three people will have a reoccurrence of their initial attack within five years of their second incident. If you're not sure whether the symptoms from your previous attack were due to the original attack or an additional event, call us at 1-800-829-8872",57,multiple sclerosis stages phases,-0.7392061948776245,2,question,6,0.00966183574879227,367,8
gpt2-xl_86,"The answer is yes. But the exact cause of MS and how it develops are still unknown, and research continues in an attempt to find a definitive answer.

Q13: How long will my body's immune system be able to keep me from getting MS? Answer: It depends on your genetic predisposition for developing MS. If you have a family history or develop other autoimmune disorders (such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease), then the MS treatment may not work. Your body has mechanisms that will allow it to fight off any invading cells from outside your body. However, if you have no previous history of autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease, then your immune system might be too weak to effectively combat any potential infection that could trigger MS. Also, the more active your immune system becomes, the greater the risk of certain infections. However, even with these risks, scientists believe there is a ""window"" during which the body can respond by producing antibodies against those specific proteins that initiate inflammation and MS. In addition, some experts feel that if the body's immune system isn't well prepared to handle certain types of bacteria, viruses or parasites, then it may not be able to deal with them as quickly. So, although we don't know what happens after this window closes, you should try to avoid people with infections because they're just another possible source of MS triggers. Another way to prevent MS is to take high doses of vitamin C. A small percentage of people who develop MS have the metabolic disorder MTHFR gene mutations that make it difficult for their bodies to absorb vitamin C properly. This means that when they eat foods containing vitamin C, they don't get enough of the nutrient.

Q14: Is it true that I might suffer from PMS before or at the same time as having MS? Answer: The short answer is that you might experience PMS symptoms as early as the first year following diagnosis of MS. More research needs to be done on this relationship.

Q15: Does my age affect my chances of developing MS? Answer: No. All forms of MS are equally common among young women and men over the age of 40. However, older adults (those ages 65 and up) have about four times the risk of developing one type of MS than do younger individuals. That said, researchers aren't sure why this is so. Some studies suggest that the brain degeneration associated with the advanced stages of MS makes",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-10.094035148620604,99,question,6,0.7443609022556391,423,0
gpt2-xl_93,"In the late 1970s, studies indicated that sleep problems were present in MS patients. The most significant problem was insomnia with a daytime sleepiness of 6-8 hours/night. These symptoms were reduced after oral melatonin treatment (10 mg). However, no evidence existed to support a link between sleep problems and other aspects of MS or any other neurologic disorder. More recent research is also pointing to an association between memory loss in MS and daytime sleepiness. However, there are still no clear answers to these questions because so little information is available on the subject, particularly regarding the potential links between fatigue and the development of MS. Another possible cause of this effect may be the use of drugs for insomnia such as Ambien which can increase REM sleep. This should be taken into consideration when assessing whether or not you need to use Ambien.

Q3: What are some other reasons why you may want to consider using sleeping pills in addition to those given above?

A: Sleep problems occur more commonly in older age groups than younger ones. As such it is essential that you look at what factors are limiting your ability to get enough sleep. For example, having trouble falling asleep is very common but it does not necessarily mean that you should try to avoid taking sleeping pills. It is important to remember that the effects of sleeping pills on the body and mind cannot be predicted from one person's experience alone, thus this issue requires much more rigorous study. People who have experienced difficulties falling asleep and who find it difficult to stop their bodies getting tired before going to bed may benefit from trying to fall asleep during the night rather than just during the day. Also, insomnia in the evening may be due to poor self-regulation. If you feel tired in the morning and then go to bed without stopping to rest, there will be a natural tendency to stay up and continue to work or take care of family members until bedtime occurs.

Some individuals will report feelings of being anxious about taking sleeping pills even though they do not wish to become drowsy. Some people may believe that if they take sleeping pills they would actually become drowsy although this may not always be the case. Sleeping pills do reduce levels of melatonin but in turn they also decrease dopamine levels which means that their effect on anxiety and depression are likely to be minimal. Thus, whilst this particular class of medications might make you sleepy it probably won't make you anxious or depressed.

In summary, while many experts recommend that people with MS try to limit their exposure to mel",93,Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?,-0.0055794934742152,0,question,6,0.0,449,49
gpt2-xl_72,"Yes, it is. The Covid-19 vaccine has been in use since the late 1980s and is recommended by the CDC as a first line of defense against MS when other treatments have failed.

When people who take multiple sclerosis medications are exposed to the virus that causes MS (Covid) or live viruses such as Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), they can get sick. These include:

• Patients on chemotherapy or radiation therapy for MS

• People with autoimmune diseases

• HIV/AIDS patients

These illnesses all cause inflammation in the body; however, the condition caused by the virus is much more serious because it causes damage inside the brain.

People who receive multiple sclerosis medicine can still be infected with this virus if they don't know it's there and their immune system isn't strong enough to fight off the infection. But once you're exposed, you usually won't become ill from this virus.

The good news about MS, though, is that your own immune system will eventually fight off this infection. When it does, you'll stop experiencing symptoms of MS.",72,Is the Covid-19 vaccine safe for people taking multiple sclerosis drugs?,-0.0034951807465404,0,question,6,0.0,177,23
gpt2-xl_79,"Yes, it is possible. MS does not affect blood flow or oxygen delivery in the lungs and may therefore pass through several families without having any effect on your own health. However, a few things should be noted about this option if you have one parent with MS and another who is unaffected by the disease: \1. You can only pass MS to your offspring if both parents are affected by the disease. Some genetic diseases such as Tay Sachs and Williams Syndrome can cause an extra copy of a gene that causes MS. This extra copy does not always result in MS but may lead to problems with some of the symptoms associated with the disease (such as vision, speech or balance problems).\2. If one parent has MS, there will probably be no risk for you if you inherit the same mutations from both of them. In most cases, however, people with a history of a certain form of the disease cannot pass a mutation to their children. In rare instances, people with these forms of MS can transmit a mutation from one parent to their children via either sperm or egg donation. It's also important to note that other genes besides those known to cause MS can influence whether someone inherits MS or passes it down to their children. For example, if you have inherited a deletion of a certain DNA segment from your mother (called X-linked recessive) then chances are you will not develop MS yourself. The reason is that even though your mother inherited a different type of CSR, she doesn't carry a copy of the complete region on her chromosome containing the relevant portion of the mutation. By contrast, if you inherit a specific segment of DNA called the CCR5-related protein 30 from your father, chances are you would develop MS because your mother does contain a full copy of that entire segment.

How long does it take for MS to progress to signs and symptoms? Answer: There isn't much agreement among scientists when describing how fast MS progresses. Some research studies suggest that MS often becomes apparent within five years of onset. Others believe that diagnosis of MS should occur at least two years before any symptoms appear, although others report that they see many patients with more advanced disease than this. Scientists use a number of different methods to assess how well an individual's brain functions and responds to external stimuli. These include neuropsychological testing (which measures skills like memory, attention span and reasoning ability), MRI scans (which measure the volume and density of nerve cells in the brain), MRIs (which are used to determine the strength and location of connections between",79,Can I pass multiple sclerosis to other family members?,-0.008171577937901,0,question,6,0.0,449,20

Answer: The key factor is maintaining good cardiovascular health as well as avoiding tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and high-risk occupations such as driving or operating hazardous machinery. The latter two can increase your chance of having a blood clot by causing you to release more blood clots when you have an abnormal reaction to something in your body (for example: a heart attack).

A blood clot occurs when a piece of blood cells breaks off, travels down the blood vessels towards the lungs where it blocks the flow of blood (clot) between them. It then stops working, usually within three days. When the blood clot breaks free, it collects in one part of the lung (pleura), at which point it becomes 'clotted' with another type of fluid called plasma (plasma being the red liquid inside your blood). Clotting is only possible if there is some sort of interaction between the particles in the clot.

Some types of surgery and even certain medications can trigger blood clots to form and stop functioning properly. You should not become ill from a blood clot - if you do get it, seek medical advice immediately. Most people who experience clots will recover without treatment in a few weeks. However, if a large clot has broken loose inside your leg and is blocking a vein in your arm, the situation might prove more serious so it is important for you to ask your doctor how long you need to rest before trying again.",101,heavy flares swelling lymph nodes,-0.8893436193466187,0,question,6,0.0,292,3

gpt2-xl_53,"a means of solving problems by changing the way we think, feel and act.

This may sound like a fairly straightforward answer but for many people who are struggling with mental illness or other difficulties, it's not. Psychotherapy offers you some help, a way to deal with your challenges without having to confront them directly. It can also be very useful in helping you make sense of the world around you - to understand why things seem so important to others and to understand how you might have made such mistakes as to cause someone else distress.

The goal of psychotherapy is to help you change these problematic thinking patterns, feelings and behaviours that keep you from enjoying life and dealing with life's stresses. The best treatment helps patients learn to see their problems through new eyes, so they no longer view themselves as victims, rather as being able to improve their lives through learning to cope with whatever life throws at us.

In general, our understanding of what psychological treatments involve has changed in recent years. Some believe that therapy should only be offered under professional supervision and that, if there's any chance of improvement, it should happen after all other therapies have been tried. These views don't reflect the reality of modern mental health services, however. Therapy is not always effective, but often it can provide an opportunity to learn about and improve specific aspects of your behaviour and personality, enabling you to live more positively. This can give you more confidence, improve relationships, reduce negative thoughts, and lead to improvements in well-being.

You can find out whether psychotherapy could benefit you by asking your GP or mental health nurse (or your local council) whether it would be suitable for you. You'll usually need to go through screening procedures before getting started, which will determine if this is something likely to work for you. If you're unsure or want to ask questions about the benefits of therapy, talk to one of your friends, family or carers.

There is no single 'right' kind of therapist. Treatment will depend on your personal circumstances, preferences and strengths. However, here are some guidelines based on research evidence.

What to expect in therapy

It's common to hear therapists refer to clients as 'you', so it's helpful to know what types of therapy do and don't work for you.

Symptoms may include sudden, severe stomach cramps and bloating, which is associated with abdominal pain; frequent bowel movements; weight loss or gain of water in the stool; fever (temperature greater than 102°F [38°C]); vomiting; a foul-smelling stool; dark colored stools; dehydration; loss of appetite and constipation; fatigue; anemia; skin rash; muscle aches; sore throat and neck; difficulty swallowing; cough; chest pain; shortness of breath; and chest congestion that does not go away. B. In many cases, these symptoms can be caused by certain infections such as typhoid fever, gastroenteritis, norovirus, meningococcal disease, and other viral illnesses. C. If diarrhea persists after the first few days of antibiotic treatment, antibiotics are required. D. In some children, acute diarrhea cannot be relieved until after age 1 month when they have become more resistant to antibiotics. E. The diagnosis of acute bacterial diarrhea requires an evaluation of the patient's underlying medical conditions.

Symptoms due to Clostridium difficile infection

In addition to gastrointestinal distress, patients with this condition often experience abdominal discomfort, nausea, cramping pain, vomiting, bloody stools, diarrhea, increased gas production, and fatigue or weakness.

The clinical picture for C. difficile infection differs from that seen in irritable bowel syndrome because the bacteria produce toxins that interfere with normal intestinal function, including those involved with digesting fiber. A number of factors can contribute to the development of C. difficile infection. Some common culprits are environmental contamination, poor nutrition and immunocompromised state, antibiotic use, and other infectious processes.

Clostridium difficile Infections in Children

Although the bacterium has been shown to cause illness in adults, most children who develop C. difficile infection do so during their infancy. Infants and toddlers are at greatest risk because the organism grows rapidly in their gut. As a result, infants' intestines may contain large amounts of organisms that help the organism thrive. This means they are particularly susceptible to developing an infection. A study in 2008 found that one out of five babies diagnosed with C. difficile was younger than 3 years old, and another 15 percent were under 2 years old. These findings underscore the need for early childhood intervention programs. Many of these efforts focus on educating parents about food safety and encouraging them to take a daily probiotic supplement",108,chronic diarrhea short-term memory sweating inability to regulate body temperature heart palpitations dysautonomia,-4.604211807250977,5,question,6,0.0847457627118644,374,10

Type 2 Diabetes – What Is It and How Does it Develop? Type 2 diabetes occurs when a person's pancreas does not produce enough insulin to control blood sugar levels (blood glucose) in the body, often caused by obesity and/or eating too many carbohydrates, sugars or starches. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes include thirst, hunger, frequent urination, fatigue, weight gain, pale skin and hair color changes, nerve damage, vision changes, shortness of breath, sleep problems, increased risk of heart attack or stroke, high cholesterol, kidney failure, nerve damage, bone pain, depression, mental confusion, and loss of muscle tone. People who have this condition may experience difficulty with walking, chewing food, driving, performing physical activities such as lifting heavy objects, sitting up straight, bending, lifting objects or climbing stairs or stairs. Because of all these issues, diagnosis of type 2 diabetes requires careful monitoring from an endocrinologist, diabetes educator or other specialists, as well as regular checkups. In addition to diabetes, patients with type 2 diabetes also experience liver and kidney problems. Most doctors expect type 2 diabetes patients will need lifelong treatment to prevent future complications from the disease.

Q: can you have a low blood sugar? Can you be diabetic with this? A: Low blood sugars are sometimes the first symptom of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. Diabetes is an endocrine disorder in which the body does not make enough insulin. The problem with POTS is that, even though the patient may feel well, her blood sugar level remains abnormally high because she has no way to control it. The only way out is for her to use insulin. This could lead to dangerously high blood sugars that would cause a stroke or heart attack. If someone was experiencing a very mild form of POTS and had been taking insulin without any problems, they might think that they were just having a little bit of a bad day when they had their regular breakfast. However, if the person is getting dangerously high blood sugar levels for no known reason, then it's time to get them checked out by their doctor. If there is also other evidence of underlying diabetes, such as hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), this will need to be treated too. In the meantime, the symptoms can be controlled by eating healthy foods like whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and low-fat dairy products (such as yogurt) and staying physically active. Q: What causes these problems? A: POTS affects all parts of the body and can affect the brain. Some people have multiple types of POTS and experience different physical and cognitive challenges at different times throughout their lives. There is no single factor responsible, but genetics seems to play some role. It can occur along a genetic chain, with genes involved starting off from common variations in gene expression patterns and gradually accumulating over several generations. For instance, children who are born with a specific mutation affecting the beta 3 adrenergic receptor gene may develop POTS later on. A child whose parents have a rare condition called Cushing's disease that results in elevated levels of catecholamines can also develop POTS. Q: Is there anything else I should know about POTS? A: You should definitely tell your family doctor what type of diabetes you're currently dealing with so that he/she can monitor you more closely. There is also a risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, which requires continuous monitoring of blood glucose. With POTS, blood sugar levels cannot go below 100 mg/dL for prolonged periods of time, which means that your doctor needs to keep track of your blood sugar levels constantly.

Q: What types of disabilities do you support? \nWhat programs or services provide these supports? Answers: We have two main kinds of disability benefits. Disability insurance protects people with chronic health conditions, such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, and HIV/AIDS, from losing their jobs or seeing their income reduced because of an illness. In addition, all workers must now carry health coverage regardless of whether they're insured through their own employer or on the job. The Social Security Administration oversees disability policy and administers disability insurance. It also has a program called Medicaid that provides supplemental health care coverage to low-income adults and children with serious illnesses. Our Health Coverage Map shows where people who qualify for social security disability, Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children's Health Insurance Program live. A person qualifies for one of those programs based on his or her income alone, not on whether he or she has one of a number of qualifying disabilities. People can change their eligibility status anytime during the year by filing a tax return using Form SS-5, Application for Change in Status. Many states grant more generous means testing to help pay for services. As long as a condition exists, anyone who has it would be eligible to apply for the appropriate assistance. If you believe a state's benefit structure discriminates against someone with a disability or if you believe you're being denied important services due to your condition, contact the organization representing your interest at 1-800-772-1213.

They are a major cause of disability and death in both developed and developing countries and they tend to be more prevalent among older people (age 45-59).

The United States is home to nearly 30 million individuals living with one or more of these chronic diseases; this represents about 9 percent of all adults and 15 percent of the population. Most of them live in rural areas where access to care is limited. According to a 2006 study published by the journal Diabetes Care, patients with a current diagnosis of type 2 diabetes had difficulty meeting their health care costs even when taking into account direct medical expenses, indirect costs, loss of work productivity due to illness, lost productivity due to disability and other factors related to diabetes. These expenses totaled $19 billion annually—roughly equal to the entire amount spent on prescription drugs for all Americans aged 19 and over. The burden of these costs is felt disproportionately by lower income families and low-income communities, which contribute disproportionately to overall healthcare costs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.[2]

In addition to contributing to high medical cost burdens, the economic losses associated with chronic diseases can also be significant. As shown in Figure 3, per capita annual expenditures on chronic diseases were more than twice the levels of the previous decade from 2004 to 2007. Per capita annual spending on cardiovascular disease was nearly three times higher than it was in 1989.

2. Why do so many people ask me about wisdom teeth surgery?

They may think they will be able to prevent or reverse gum disease if their wisdom teeth are removed. However, this is not true for all cases. There can also be serious complications associated with removal of wisdom teeth. It's important that you understand the risks involved before deciding on wisdom tooth surgery. The following information outlines some common causes of wisdom tooth problems and how to avoid them.

The most common cause of problems with wisdom teeth is that they don't grow properly – this can lead to dental caries (eating disorder). This type of decay occurs when bacteria from plaque form an infection at the surface of the tooth. If left untreated, the bacteria can travel through your bloodstream, affecting organs like your heart, brain, bladder, liver, kidneys and lungs. As a result of these consequences, there are other types of diseases that occur more frequently in patients who have cavities in their wisdom teeth.

Other potential reasons why individuals would want wisdom tooth removal include:

Pain relief after a severe injury or illness

An extreme sensitivity to sound

Possible medical conditions

A desire to make it look younger

If you're considering wisdom tooth surgery, it's important to discuss possible adverse effects such as infection, pain and bleeding before making any decision. Discussing issues related to your health with your doctor can help him determine whether wisdom tooth removal should proceed. You can find out more by talking to your dentist, nurse practitioner or physician assistant.

3. What happens during wisdom tooth removal?

Wisdom tooth extraction involves cutting away the inner root portion of a wisdom tooth, while also removing the pulp layer of the tooth. In a typical procedure, doctors use a special tool called a dental drill to open up the tooth to get into its structure. They then remove the affected section using a laser and forceps. The process takes around 20 minutes. During this time, doctors perform a few checks to ensure the integrity of the tooth and keep it clean, including taking pictures of every part to document what has been taken out and replaced. After all the work is done, the patient returns home to recover.

4. How long does it take for wisdom tooth removal?

A Ketogenic Diet Helps Lower Blood Sugar & Blood Pressure, but Should Be Used With Caution\u2019s Answer

The ketogenic diet has become widely accepted as an effective treatment for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. But this diet should not be undertaken without consulting your doctor, as some of its side effects are serious enough to warrant hospitalization. You may also need to follow a low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LCHF) diet as part of any treatment program. In addition, you will need to make lifestyle changes such as changing your eating habits, exercising more frequently, and avoiding alcohol.1 As long as these dietary changes are kept up, you may be able to manage your diabetes on a ketogenic diet.2

Ketosis in Type 1 Diabetes

In most cases, when people take medications for their diabetes, they usually have a fasting blood sugar level greater than 70 mg/dL. When people use the ketogenic diet, however, they typically have lower blood sugars at first—but then fall back down after about 6 months.3 This is because the body adjusts by reducing insulin production, which results in a rapid drop in blood sugar levels.4

Even though ketones don't get stored as fat, this means that people on a ketogenic diet generally lose weight during their fasting period.5 Although weight loss isn't always desirable, losing too much weight could cause health problems such as kidney stones or heart disease.6

How Ketone Bodies Help Control Tiredness \u2014 Why They're Important \u2014 How to Use Them

People who have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes often experience tiredness, but there's no clear explanation as to why this happens. One study suggests that fatigue is caused by glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, and that using supplemental protein can help to alleviate these symptoms.7

Another theory is that the presence of ketone bodies in the bloodstream provides a source of energy.8 A recent review article suggested that ketones might be particularly beneficial for treating chronic fatigue syndrome.9 Because the liver produces ketones for fuel, people with diabetes are less likely to develop fatty liver diseases or cirrhosis.10

In general, physical activity is beneficial for everyone, with moderate or vigorous intensity at least two to three times a week being the most effective. However, there are many individual differences in how much physical activity is ideal, so the best way to determine your level of fitness and need for regular physical activity is to do some research.

""The more physically active I am, the better I feel.""- Mary Jane Mottram


Mary Jane Mottram explains that the main reason people get fat is not because they're inactive, but because they eat too little; if they were just as fit as they think they are, their food intake would be higher and they'd have less body weight to gain. Therefore, the key is to build up their stamina and endurance to handle any situation they may encounter, such as driving to work or getting stuck on the side of the road.


Practical tips for building stamina and endurance while exercising\nSome things to consider before starting an exercise program

You don't always need to go to the gym, though. Here are some tips from personal trainers, athletes and doctors on what to try first.


When you start training, you should aim for something around 2 hours. It's difficult to achieve this without feeling tired or worse after an hour or so, so make sure you've tried everything else you could think of first. There isn't really one ""best"" workout, although exercises which require more speed than strength will benefit you more (such as sprinting, rowing or swimming).


It's also important to take breaks when you feel like you're running out of steam. Take a walk if possible - it'll help boost your heart rate and burn calories; it also gives your muscles a break! If your legs are burning too quickly, however, just stand up and stretch.


Physical activities are good for you: the good news is that you can use them to improve other areas of your life such as self esteem, confidence, concentration and even your sex drive!

Q9) Are there any advantages to using a different type of exercise program?

A9) Yes, in that they make you feel more energetic, better at performing the workout, and less sore afterwards.

Q10) How often should I workout? What kind of weightlifting workouts do you recommend?

A10) For anyone who has been lifting weights regularly for many years, we suggest starting with a few bodyweight-only exercises. As time goes by, progress to heavier weight classes. You will begin to notice a difference in how fast you can lift heavy objects and improve your flexibility as well. If you have had serious knee injuries, we highly recommend staying away from all running. We always urge people to find an appropriate form of conditioning exercise before attempting jumping rope, crossfit, swimming, etc..

The last thing we would advise is making dramatic gains in just a short amount of time. The average person cannot handle significant weight increases overnight. A good rule of thumb is to start slowly (and gradually build up over several months), then take the necessary steps toward the goal each month.

Head Pads can be used as a topical treatment to reduce the itching and inflammation of Psoriasis. It is also suitable for treating the dryness and itching caused by eczema, psoriatic arthritis (RA) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). They are not suitable for the treatment of other skin conditions such as acne, rosacea, lichen sclerosus, hives, psoriasis, fungal infections and other skin diseases. The benefits of using them include:

Psoriasis is usually accompanied by severe itchiness, redness and swelling of the skin, especially around the face, neck and groin areas. This results in frequent scratching and rubbing of the affected area which leads to increased blood flow to this region. In addition, excessive scratching increases the risk of infection due to fungi and bacteria. These are then passed into the body through skin abrasions and wounds.

Pseudofolliculitis is an abnormal accumulation of dead skin cells on the surface of the skin.

Acne can be treated with over-the-counter creams that often contain salicylic acid. However, they have not been shown to be effective against the most common types of acne - nodular, papules and pustules (acne vulgaris), erythematous and mixed comedones (inflammatory acne) and trichotillomania. They do work well in preventing scarring caused by acne and sometimes it is necessary to use more than one type of medication at once. A cream containing 0% salicylic acid has been reported to improve the appearance of scars, but its efficacy for treatment of psoriasis remains unproven. Salicylic acid is a known irritant. It should never be applied directly to any part of the skin except the eye area where it may cause blindness.

The itch caused by psoriasis is worse when the scalp is involved. Hence some people choose to avoid wearing a hat while they are applying a mask.

Some patients prefer to wear hats in bed whilst sleeping because they can relax their muscles during sleep so that pain and itchiness are less likely to occur. The following chart shows the number of patients who said they would change what they wore if they could:

You could have a stroke, or an aortic dissection, or even lose a leg, but you won't know it for sure until you begin taking medicine to suppress your immune system and lessen the effects of MS. If you are experiencing more side effects than normal during treatment, stop treatment immediately. In most cases, the side effects from starting medication soon after onset are mild.\n

Q: Why should I take my prescription medicine at night? \nAnswer: While medications can cause drowsiness, many people experience some of these symptoms when they sleep because their bodies need time to adapt to treatment. For example, if you're on a regimen that contains long-acting corticosteroid medicines, this means that you're likely going to be sleeping in deep sleep, which is important for maintaining healthy nerve function and reducing inflammation. However, if you don't get enough sleep, your body needs a break from the pain drugs. After one month off therapy, you might not wake up as well, since your body has not had enough rest. Don't worry -- this kind of insomnia doesn't last forever. Over time, you'll learn how to adjust to having less sleep. Once you've gotten used to that new schedule, you can return to a full schedule of sleeping 6 hours per night (a little easier said than done, we know). Be patient; you'll probably notice a difference right away!

How often do I have to see my doctor before beginning treatment?

You don't necessarily have to see your doctor every day while you're on MS medications. It's very common to have follow-up visits within 3 months. Your doctor might want to check your results if you didn't respond to your first dose of medications, especially if you haven't slept for 24 hours or more. At any point throughout the year, ask your doctor about how frequent he or she plans to visit you. A yearly appointment can help make certain that you're getting all of your MS medications under control.",94,When will I start to feel better with multiple sclerosis?,-1.9786947965621948,13,question,7,0.06132075471698113,342,17

Question: achy back/neck\nAnswer: nagging pains in the back and neck, sometimes on movement.

Question: aching or tight muscles\nAnswer: muscles often become tight when overworked. This may be due to muscle strains from prolonged exercise; these strains are usually self-limiting after some time. It is helpful to stretch them regularly. There is no medical reason for this condition.

Question: acne\nAnswer: skin pimples can occur as a result of hormonal changes. They are caused by excess oil produced during pregnancy. If you have not had your period (or if you are a postpartum woman), these symptoms will disappear with time. However, if you continue to experience them, see your doctor.

Question: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\nAnswer: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most common behavioral disorder affecting children and adolescents. Symptoms include difficulty paying attention and difficulty controlling impulses. ADHD is treatable and is often treated through therapy and medication. Unfortunately, many people do not seek treatment until their teen years, at which point they may not understand that the problems they face are normal adolescent responses to life experiences.

Question: Atopic dermatitis\nAnswer: Acne is an allergic reaction caused by bacteria called Propionibacterium acnes. An adult with a history of atopic disease develops atopy without knowing it. A person who has been exposed to atopy develops skin lesions that resemble those seen in someone with atopic dermatitis. These lesions might itch but generally heal within two weeks. People who develop eczema should avoid sun exposure while having a flare up of their eczema.

gpt2-xl_63,"Yes. Multiple sclerosis is a debilitating disease that causes progressive damage to the central nervous system, and it can cause permanent disabilities including blindness or paralysis. It affects people in all ages but more so those older than 50. The most common form of MS is called relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), which is characterized by attacks of relapses at irregular intervals. However, there are other forms such as secondary progressive MS (SPMS) where there may be no recurrence after an initial attack of symptoms.

People with RRMS also have a higher risk for stroke, heart failure and neurological complications like peripheral neuropathy. People who have SPMS often develop spinal cord compression when their legs become numb, painful or weak.

As well, they're more likely to experience cognitive problems such as memory loss, poor attention span, difficulty concentrating or problem solving. These effects usually begin within 2 years of diagnosis. In some cases, they last longer. Those with SPMS may need special equipment to walk or use a wheelchair; however, many still manage to work.

The good news is that once you've been diagnosed with MS, your life will be easier because it's less likely you'll suffer from any physical disability. You might even find ways to help yourself feel better without having to wait for a medical appointment — for example, by taking daily walks, getting plenty of exercise, staying physically active and not smoking!

If you know someone who has been diagnosed with MS, ask him/her about managing his/her condition. Also talk with friends and family members, too.

gpt2-xl_85,"MS is a neurodegenerative disorder, with all the symptoms of other degenerative diseases such as cancer. We know that MS patients who have relapsed to childhood-onset disease relapse into it again and again (relapses are not uncommon in MS). There has been speculation for some time that there might be an environmental trigger which causes these repeated relapses. It was also suggested that environmental toxins may play a role. To our knowledge, there has never been any direct evidence linking chemical exposures to MS; however, we suspect that this is partly because people with MS do not often get exposed to high levels of pesticides or heavy metals.

A study by Poulton et al. [3] showed that blood samples from adults diagnosed with MS were significantly enriched in aluminium compared with those without MS. The authors concluded that aluminium, probably due to its breakdown product aluminium oxide, could promote MS development. This hypothesis had been advanced before. For example, Moseley et al. [4] pointed out that aluminium exposure in early life can influence immune function later on through its effects on autoimmunity. However, this was the first study which used urine analysis to look for aluminium residues. In addition, Poulton et al.'s sample size of six individuals did not allow the detection of more subtle differences between individuals than would normally occur if there was only one person per group.

In 1998, Gage et al. [5] reported that two subjects living near a large aluminium smelter in north Wales had developed MS over four years after exposure to dust generated by the factory. These results were subsequently confirmed by Kupffer et al. [6], who studied seven patients with MS and nine healthy controls. These scientists found increased aluminium concentration in both groups. Furthermore, the number of lesions associated with MS was significantly higher among the aluminium-exposed subjects. These findings suggested a possible link between aluminium exposure during the early developing period and MS later on. Moreover, they highlighted the importance of understanding whether aluminium plays a causal role in the genesis of MS. One year later, Kupffer et al. [7] presented further data showing that aluminium in drinking water was strongly correlated with the risk of having MS. It is well known that aluminium accumulates in our bodies. Since drinking water supplies are contaminated, we should keep a close watch over our use of this precious natural resource.

It now seems probable that aluminium exposure triggers MS development, although we still lack the information needed to confidently predict what impact this will have",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-8.013972282409668,122,question,7,0.6192893401015228,423,0
gpt2-xl_123,"Thyroid disorders, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease are the most common causes of symptoms in hypothyroid patients. However, there is a wide variety of other causes that can cause similar signs and symptoms.


Treatment for Hypothyroidism Symptoms (Hypothyroidism) Symptoms can vary with each individual patient, depending on age and overall health status, including medications used to treat or prevent other conditions or diseases, including hypothyroidism. Patients who have primary hypothyroidism should receive periodic blood testing to measure the amount of thyroid hormones circulating in their bodies. Most often this will be done by obtaining a complete blood cell count (CBC). The most commonly prescribed treatment for hypothyroidism is replacement doses of thyroxine or triiodothyronine. The replacement dosage usually includes an injection called levothyroxine. Other types of replacement therapy include the use of a ""Thyroid Stimulating Agent."" This medication stimulates the body's own production of thyroid hormone. If needed, it may also help the person tolerate additional injections. There are several different kinds of thyroid stimulating agents available. Some people prefer to take a combination of two or more forms of thyroid-stimulating agent at the same time so that they get the benefits of both medications. As mentioned above, some studies indicate that taking levothyroxine with parenteral nutrition improves the effects of the combined medication. While thyroid-stimulant drugs provide good results when taken together, there is no evidence of benefit from combining them with another drug that contains progestins like the oral contraceptive pill. If you choose to combine one of these treatments with your estrogen therapy, it is important to do so cautiously. Pregnant women, those undergoing surgery or radiation treatment, or individuals with autoimmune conditions are not advised to combine iodine intake with these types of medications.


Mood Disorders - Hyperthyroidism Can Cause Mood Changes In some cases of hyperthyroidism, depression or anxiety can occur after diagnosis due to changes in the brain chemicals responsible for mood control. This phenomenon has been reported in approximately 50% of patients treated with thyroxine for over 10 years. This condition may occur only temporarily during treatment, or persist into adulthood. To address the problem, doctors prescribe antidepressants or serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, venlafaxine, duloxetine, and",123,hypothyroidism symptoms,-2.4955649375915527,30,question,7,0.18518518518518517,372,6

One of the ways to minimize this risk is by using an anti-inflammatory drug, such as ibuprofen (Advil®) or naproxen sodium (Aleve). These drugs are effective in preventing flare ups but they can be harmful if used too often. This may lead to an adverse reaction called ""post-exertional malaise"" which lasts for a few days after stopping treatment.

Avoiding these risks means going slow with your medication. Don't take more than 1 hour between taking a dose of ibuprofen and another one. Use only small amounts of aspirin at a time.

Another way to reduce post-exertional malaise is to avoid exercise, especially long distance running, while you're on medication. This will help prevent blood clots from forming during exercise. And take it easy and sleep when tired, so you don't get headaches.

Question: What's your favorite book to study with? Answer: I don't like reading textbooks. I really think that there is no reason for me to waste my time on these things and they're not worth it at all! In terms of books, I would say ""The Little Prince"". It's a very interesting story about a boy who doesn't have any parents and he tries to make his own family by getting into different people's business. As a result, he ends up taking care of a cat as well. I've always loved this book because I love cats too. I've been fascinated by that idea ever since I was little.

I'd also say ""Invisible Cities"" and ""A Study of Spring"". Both of those are quite good stories too. They don't tell us what we should be doing but they give us an insight into how life can be better than the way we currently live it. They were written after WWII when Japan had invaded China. This made everyone afraid of China and so they tried to create a society without fear or hatred. But then some people started showing their true colors and the rest is history. So both of these stories show the consequences of hatred and fear.

Question: Do you remember where you learned to read? Answer: Yes. I used to go to school every day from 6am until 7pm. My teacher gave us homework. We had to learn the entire alphabet from A through Z. Then we had to write out a sentence based off our letter. So one morning I didn't get dressed properly and was late. She called me into her room and said: ""You're late."" I told her that I'm not really late, it was actually 4 am. She asked me what was wrong and why I was so late. I told her that my hair looked weird and that I only got there 3 minutes early. She told me I could wear long pants and heels if I wanted to. I decided against it because I felt like I might look stupid wearing my high-heeled shoes. It turned out to be an excellent decision.

Q: What are some signs that my brain may have been damaged by MS? Answer: The most common sign is an attack of weakness or numbness to any part of the body. This occurs when the nervous system has trouble getting enough oxygen to cells throughout your body. It's also called ""spinal cord blockage."" A neurologist will examine you and measure your level of consciousness to see if you're having a stroke. If you do not regain full control of your arm and leg muscles after two hours, it means that your nerve connections between the brain and spinal cord have probably been damaged. Neurologists then try to repair these nerves with surgery. Another symptom of damage to your brain is confusion, difficulty speaking, loss of vision and/or balance, or memory problems.


Q: How long does it take for symptoms to resolve once I'm diagnosed with MS? Answer: Symptoms usually improve within one to three months. Some people have slower recovery times, while others' symptoms may come back at any time during treatment.

Also, there are genetic conditions (such as Glycaemic Index, Lipid Profiles etc.) which may affect your risk even more so than those mentioned above. The fact remains though, that it's highly unlikely that your risk will increase by more than 10%.

CASE 4

In-Depth Question: What happened to you when you first learned that you had MS? Answer: I was a high school student. My teacher and mother both shared in my diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.

CASE 5

In-Depth Question: What did you know about MS at the time this test was administered? Answer: At the time, I didn't realize that I would be diagnosed with MS. However, one day on the way home from school, I realized how tired and slow I felt because of what seemed like all the pain. It turned out that I had gotten hit by a car while crossing the street and suffered some broken bones. I went back to school after a few days, but it took me another month before I got better enough for the rest of the semester. I wasn't able to play sports anymore either because I'd injure myself so badly during practice. But I still continued to work hard in my classes and enjoy being around people who knew about my condition.

CASE 6

In-Depth Question: If you could do anything again, would you change something about your life? Answer: Yes. I wish I had spent more time learning things about health care. Since I now have MS, I'm afraid I will never get to experience having someone look into my eyes and listen to my voice and tell me the next step for me. When I think back to why I wanted to become a nurse, it is because I believed I could help others and make a difference. If I ever find the confidence to ask those questions, I am sure they won't seem as important.

gpt2-xl_57,"Multiple sclerosis is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with no known cure. It affects the central nervous system (CNS) and can be divided into four distinct stages: primary, secondary, relapsing-remitting, and secondary progressive. Each stage has its own diagnostic criteria for identifying cases of MS, which we will describe below in more detail.

Q: What is the most common site of MS lesions? Answer: The two main sites are the brain and spinal cord.

Q: Why do people develop multiple sclerosis as adults or later on in life? Answer: Multiple sclerosis may affect someone at any age but usually begins to show up when someone is in their 40s. However, many patients who have had MS since childhood continue to experience symptoms in early adulthood. Most people with MS live with it for about 10 years before developing significant disability.

Q: How does my doctor diagnose multiple sclerosis? Answer: Your doctor will perform an extensive neurological exam, including a thorough physical examination, an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and a blood test called a white cell count. These tests help your doctor find abnormalities in the body's immune response that could indicate multiple sclerosis, such as low levels of antibodies (white blood cells). This test also helps your doctor identify whether you are genetically susceptible to MS or not. Once your doctor makes this diagnosis, he/she will recommend treatment options for you based on your results.

Q: Is there any medication that can prevent progression of my MS? Answer: No drug currently approved by the FDA is available to treat MS. Scientists don't know exactly why some people develop MS while others do not; however, some scientists believe that the genetics of both people and their environment play a role. Some medications, such as corticosteroids, suppress the inflammatory process of MS by reducing the production of antibodies (which cause inflammation) and therefore preventing further damage to the body's tissues. Other medicines, like immunosuppressants, can reduce inflammation without suppressing production of the white blood cells (called B cells) responsible for making the antibody needed to fight off infection in the first place.

Q: Does it matter if I take certain drugs or supplements? Answer: In general, medications taken during pregnancy and lactation or those used during or after surgery aren't likely to harm an unborn baby because these conditions alter hormones associated with cell growth and development. If you're considering taking prescription medicine or a dietary supplement, discuss the risks and benefits with your health care provider before using them.",57,multiple sclerosis stages phases,-0.5861341953277588,2,question,7,0.00966183574879227,417,8

This can also reduce viral load in the blood, thus increasing overall immunity to infection.

Q. Re: Do I get any more money from my ex-husband after he remarries?: You'll get less for divorce than you would have received before you got divorced. So, yes, you should file for divorce.

A: I do agree with you on the fact that the amount of time to file for divorce is longer than in the past because of the Internet. As I said earlier, there are still cases out there where people wait years before filing. But now, when everyone has access to legal information via the Internet, I think it will become easier to file. This new technology also makes it much cheaper for women (and men) to sue their husbands who cheat them out of wages.

I know a few married couples that have had their marital problems solved by a court order ordering each spouse to take an anti-depressant medication (for example, Zoloft). It seems like most judges feel that unless you have a very good reason why you want a prescription, then you don't deserve one. I remember once hearing the judge say to a woman, ""You must really hate me. Why did you send me that letter?"" She replied, ""Well, I didn't, but I'm so tired of him doing these terrible things to me!"" A lot of divorces begin as a couple fighting over property, alimony and division of assets. Now, both parties have the ability to file for divorce.

The final question asked if the patient had received any prior radiation therapy, and included a list of potential reasons for prior therapy. The reason code for ""no"" was unspecified. For each response, we coded the following information (codes were not combined):

1 – no previous radiation treatment,

2 – no previous chemotherapy other than radiotherapy,

3 – no previous surgery (including radiology or surgery),

4 – no previous radiation therapy,

5 – other (e.g., pregnancy).

Statistical analysis

We used Stata software to analyze data from these patients. To control for potential confounding factors related to the study population, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we removed women who reported more frequent follow-up visits; we did not remove women who died before their scheduled follow-up visit, since this would have introduced bias into the results. We then performed univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses to examine whether any prior exposure to ionizing radiation could predict the risk of developing any type of cancers. The incidence rate ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using conditional logistic regression with adjustment for age at diagnosis, body mass index (BMI), education level, smoking status, use of hormone replacement therapy during the previous 3 years, menopausal status, current oral contraceptive use, past oral contraceptives use, parity, total number of live births, and time spent in the highest tertile of pack-years of alcohol intake (P <.05 was considered statistically significant). For all analyses, we calculated P values based on an intention-to-treat principle. A 2-sided P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical tests were two sided.

gpt2-xl_58,"High risk

The risk of developing MS is increased by high exposure to environmental toxins and chemicals (called ""toxins"") found in the environment, such as lead, mercury, pesticides, heavy metals, radon, asbestos, or solvents. In fact, several studies have shown that these substances are associated with an increased incidence of MS.[3] The risk of developing MS increases dramatically at levels much higher than those which are considered safe. For example, a study conducted by Dr. James C. Hormone Jr., PhD, has demonstrated that even low levels of mercury can result in a substantial increase in the chance of MS development.[4] This may be because there are many more free radicals produced when lead particles interact with DNA compared to mercury vapor, which can increase the chances of damage to proteins and other biological molecules. Furthermore, it should also be noted that long-term exposure to lead causes irreversible nerve cell death through oxidative stress. It's important to note that some people who have suffered from MS will not develop this disease until they reach adulthood or beyond, while others will have symptoms within a few years after beginning their careers.

Dietary Restrictions

Q: Can I limit my consumption of certain foods? A: Dietary restrictions are possible for those individuals who suffer from Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However, eating poorly or avoiding certain foods has been shown to contribute to muscle atrophy. Eating healthy and exercising regularly are essential aspects of managing MS. Many experts recommend limiting your caloric intake and consuming adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals daily. For instance, one article states that a person needs 3,000 milligrams of vitamin D per day to prevent deficiency in the future.[5] One study reported that individuals who consumed fewer than 775 milligrams of calcium per day were 50% more likely to develop MS.[6] The most effective way to reduce the risk of MS is through proper nutrition. If you do decide to restrict your diet, make sure that you stay hydrated, eat healthy food choices, and don't smoke to avoid secondhand cigarette smoke. There are plenty of vegetarian options available, including mushrooms, spinach, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and collard greens. Avoid eating too many carbohydrates; instead, choose foods rich in protein and fat. Avoid alcohol as well if you suffer from MS. Alcoholic beverages, particularly wine and beer, contain toxic substances that can harm the nervous system. Other suggestions include drinking water or soft drinks during your meal break.

Diagnosis Question: My son has been having trouble breathing in recent weeks. His breath sounds like he is holding his breath. He also coughs up mucus. What is wrong? Answer: You may be experiencing phlegm, which is a fluid that contains air trapped in tiny pockets. The lungs do not work well with this type of fluid because they lack proper airflow. When your child has difficulty breathing, the most commonly diagnosed cause could be allergies. Other possible causes include sinusitis, pneumonia, an infection of the lung tissue or even cancer. It is important for you to seek medical attention when these types of illnesses occur as your doctor can give you more information about your child's condition and make any necessary treatment decisions.

Diagnosis Question: We were wondering how we would know our baby is growing properly? Answer: There are several signs that will help you determine whether your baby is growing normally. Most babies begin to show growth spurts between 2-4 months old, so it is important to pay close attention to what your baby does during those first few months. Watch for changes such as decreased appetite, increased sleeping time, weight gain, excessive wet diapers, etc... If your baby seems to be growing at an abnormal rate, it should prompt you to take him/her to see a pediatrician. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends regular monitoring by your doctor throughout infancy.

What Should I Do About my Child's Infantile Paralysis (IP)? IP is sometimes referred to as infantile epilepsy, and is a serious neurological disorder affecting primarily infants younger than one year. If left untreated, infants with IPD may suffer from seizures or developmental delays associated with their condition. Infants who do not receive appropriate therapies and support from parents can experience significant social and emotional issues, loss of independence, and limited quality of life.


The American Epilepsy Society estimates approximately 20 children die each day in the U.S. due to epilepsy, including those with IP. Children under 1 year of age affected by IPD are particularly vulnerable to developing problems such as developmental delay, mental retardation, poor feeding habits, physical deformities, and other health complications that can lead to death.

Step 3. Pull on the belt. Repeat Step 1 until your hand comes off the end of the chain. Now go out of the room and do your stretches.


Back stretch - How to do it

This should feel good!

The front of the body stays in position while you gently pull with each hand.

Here's an example. There are two different ways of doing this exercise. The first way works better if your wrists are loose and relaxed, so that you can move them independently without feeling tension or strain.

Your feet should be firmly planted behind your head and shoulders. Keep your arms straight by keeping your hands flat on the ground (no twists), and slowly press down on the chains with your palms facing downward and the fingers together. You'll feel the tension in your upper back relax as your hands push against the chains. If you don't have any resistance, try a few more repetitions until you're able to keep a slight pressure on the chains.

If you like the ""push-pull"" method above, then try the following variation.

Start in the same position, except now you put your hands under the bars and grab hold with both hands; there should be enough space between your hands to work with. Again, apply some pressure on the chains with your palms and squeeze hard until they release. Your goal here is to get as much force into the chains as possible, as opposed to letting them just rest quietly. When you can't get more force into the chains anymore, start over again!


How to do it correctly

When doing these exercises correctly, your arms stay bent at 90 degrees and your elbows remain locked. You keep your chest low and your belly sticking up. When you perform each set, you should only let your arms drift sideways slightly. It's okay to feel a little bit of a stretch at the beginning because you'll probably make mistakes at first. After you've done the exercise about 10 times, you can gradually increase the speed of the movement.

gpt2-xl_53,"Psychotherapy is a therapeutic process that focuses on the individual's interaction with his/her environment and the influence of his/her thoughts, feelings and behavior. It can also be defined as a mental or psychological intervention in order to resolve or correct problems in one's life.

In psychiatry, it may be used for the treatment of some forms of psychiatric disorders (such as depression) as well as other conditions such as anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Psychotherapy was first introduced into medicine by Otto Rank in 1884, in which he proposed an approach called ""Korrespondenz"" (or Korrelation), which focuses on the patient's inner emotional reactions to specific situations in his environment. The aim is to help the client change his own behaviors and attitudes towards these situations, thus reducing their impact on him or her. Today, this form of therapy is widely accepted as the standard method of treating depressive symptoms in most countries. Although there are many different types of psychotherapy, each having its own characteristics and advantages over others, they all share common goals: to assist patients with coping and/or increasing resilience against difficulties related to their condition.

What kind of tasks do psychologists perform?\u003c\/p>\u003e

Psychologists are trained professionals who specialize in the analysis and interpretation of human behavior and personality. Their main task is to use objective methods to collect data and gather information from participants to create a more comprehensive picture of how people think and behave. As individuals develop and mature, they tend to acquire habits that make them less able to cope with everyday challenges. Psychological therapy aims to promote improvement in coping abilities through ongoing personal development and learning skills that will enable people to better cope with stressful life events and circumstances.

How much does your salary depend on where you live?\u003c\/p>\u003e

Your pay depends on your location. According to the American Community Survey 1-year estimates for 2016, average annual salaries are $60,000 for those living in the northeast; $62,000 for those living in the Midwest; $67,400 for those living in the West; and $73,100 for those living in the South. In contrast, the national median annual income for Americans aged 25 years or older is just under $50,000.

gpt2-xl_108,"What are the best foods for healthy kidney function?

The most important thing is to get enough potassium and sodium. Both of these minerals help with regulating body temperatures, which affects blood pressure, electrolytes (potassium helps in keeping your water balance while salt controls fluid volume) and muscle contraction. This also means that a high potassium intake will prevent excessive muscle cramping, as well as help you control your thirst better.

Additionally, a diet high in fruits, vegetables and grains can help keep your kidneys functioning properly. The carbohydrates in these foods help to lower your cholesterol levels and prevent your arteries from clogging up. Fruits like bananas, oranges and avocados are particularly rich in fiber and antioxidants that work to protect against certain diseases like cancer and cardiovascular disease.

gpt2-xl_45,"Yes, you can cure diabetes by diet and exercise. You cannot reverse the disease in people with type 1 or 2 diabetes because they are predisposed to it.""

In a nutshell, if you are able to control your blood sugar level you will not need insulin injections for life. The only exception would be a person who is having an acute insulin reaction (called hypoglycemia) which could lead to death. There is no way to predict when this might occur so any intervention should be done at the first sign of symptoms.

A small number of patients with type 1 diabetes have been successfully treated using gene therapy, but most research has focused on treating adults and children with type 2 diabetes. This approach uses a patient's own cells from their pancreas that contain a modified version of the T cell receptor found in the pancreas itself. As these cells grow, they enter the body where they multiply until they reach a critical size and start producing insulin.

There are currently two main types of gene therapy, T-cell immunotherapy and targeted delivery of a virus containing the genetic material. Some studies suggest these treatments may work better than others, but none have yet proven safe enough to be used in humans without a trial.

How does it compare to standard treatment for Type 1 diabetes?

Treatment usually consists of daily insulin injections and daily glucose monitoring. It also includes lifestyle changes such as reducing stress, exercising more and eating less sugar-laden foods. If the initial results are positive then regular insulin injection can be given once every three months as necessary. However, many patients find their diabetes responds better when their treatment is started earlier rather than later and they can gradually reduce the amount of insulin injected each month.

Other treatments include oral medication to boost glucagon levels, as well as alternative medicine techniques. These therapies include acupuncture, reflexology, chiropractic care and osteopathy. They all aim to help improve blood sugar control and may take some time to show signs of success. Many patients report feeling better immediately after starting treatment.

What happens if I get a relapse of my condition?

Losing weight can prevent a diabetic flare up. Insulin injections often increase appetite and some people become overweight in order to lose excess weight.

If a person stops taking their drugs then the body needs insulin for survival. After long periods without treatment, the immune system becomes weakened so the cells start to die off, leaving them unable to produce insulin effectively again.

Q. What do you use for your bath?\nAnswer: It depends on what time of day it is and if there are any allergies or sensitivities. For example, I only bath in the shower and not in a tub. Also, I only take my shampoo with me while I bathe as they might irritate my scalp. If I have a sensitive scalp then I go straight from the shower into the bath water. But if I'm feeling really good about myself, I like to splash around a little bit with just an aerosol spray bottle, like with my hair dryer.

If there's no allergy or sensitivity, I'll stick to using hot water and plain soap for bathing. In fact, I've never used a shampoo because I don't want anything irritating my skin.

Q. How long does it take you to feel better after having an operation?\nAnswer: Usually within 24 hours. After going home and letting my body heal for a few days, I usually wake up feeling much more rested than I did before the procedure.

My husband sometimes finds my skin a little sore for a couple of days after surgery but he hasn't had any problems with his own skin since we met. My doctor says that it takes anywhere between two and four weeks for your skin to get back to normal. And most people end up doing their hair right after having an operation so I know that will be easy for him!

Q. Can you tell us a bit about your recovery process?\nAnswer: I try to spend as much time as possible with my family and friends during this period because I need them to help keep me motivated. The hardest part isn't getting out of bed, but rather being able to eat and drink normally again without all those extra chemicals trying to destroy my health.

I also start taking vitamins such as Vitamin C, B12, iodine, folic acid (for pregnant women) and calcium once a week. These supplements provide a lot of nutrients and minerals and help strengthen my immune system so it won't react so badly when there's a reaction later on.

The hardest thing is waiting to see how my scar heals, but I know it will be done quickly. This time of year I feel particularly tired so I try to give myself some rest every night.

Q11: I was diagnosed with EDS in my thirties when I took a course of antidepressants for depression and anxiety. A few years ago, I noticed changes in my skin; they became rough and dry and itchy. Is this EDS? If so, what causes it? I've also had a cough-like feeling for several months now. Should I see a doctor about these symptoms? Answers (from the doctors) - Dr. D.: EDS is an umbrella term which includes many conditions including, but not limited to, cystic fibrosis, seborrhoeic dermatitis, psoriasis, erythema multiforme, and scleroderma. Most cases are caused by a genetic predisposition. EDS has been shown to be more common among African Americans. The exact cause is unknown but it is thought to involve some combination of genetic predisposing factors such as increased cortisol levels and decreased adrenal activity, among other things. The best treatment options include medications, psychological treatments, nutrition, stress management and dietary modifications.

Q12: My husband's aunt passed away, and his mother went through chemo for breast cancer. Both of them were extremely obese. They both suffered from extreme fatigue and constant hunger, both during and after the treatment. I am concerned because of their weight. What can we do to help our friend cope with her illness? Answer: Weight loss can help alleviate your loved one's symptoms, but it isn't a cure. People who are overweight tend to have higher rates of serious health problems and diseases that result in premature death. Fat people who take part in physical activities or exercise regularly often experience reductions in fatigue and joint stiffness, which makes them feel better. So far, no studies show any link between obesity and longevity, but there have been studies suggesting a link to high blood pressure and diabetes. To prevent your loved one from gaining too much weight, talk to him/her about healthy eating habits and a balanced diet. Your loved one needs regular exercise, too. You should encourage your loved one to get involved in physical activities even if he or she doesn't like doing them. Exercise helps burn fat, improves bone density and keeps muscles strong. And you can encourage your loved one to try new foods. Remember, even if your loved one loses weight, it won't eliminate all of his/her symptoms.",109,ehlers danlos syndrome POTS nausea stomach pain,-11.811110496520996,35,question,8,0.875,392,0

It may also help explain why people who do not get diagnosed get better quicker – they don't need to wait for doctors to confirm that their symptoms are relapsing MS.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) Alzheimer's disease occurs as a result of the accumulation of abnormal proteins within cells. As these proteins accumulate, they impair cellular functions including memory, mood, judgement and coordination. It may also cause problems with body posture, concentration and balance. There are two types of AD; early-onset and late-onset. Early onset, or milder forms appear over 30 years before dementia develops. Late-onset, or more severe forms, are seen after age 60 and occur later than in the first group. Alzheimer's disease affects approximately 5 million people worldwide. In Canada alone it will affect 4 million by 2020. This disease can be treated successfully through cognitive rehabilitation therapy and other treatments.


Cancer Cancer is the fourth leading killer behind heart disease, stroke and respiratory illness. The majority of cancer cases result from the uncontrolled growth and spread of normal cells into cancerous tissue. While many cancers are genetic, some, such as cervical, breast and prostate cancers, are caused by environmental factors such as cigarette smoke and contaminated water. Smoking causes about one third of all cancer deaths in women and 15% of deaths among men. Many cancers are prevented by being active, eating healthy foods and staying out of the sun. People at highest risk of developing some types of cancer include those who regularly consume alcohol, use tobacco products, who were exposed to carcinogens in the workplace and/or during childhood, who are not physically active and have diabetes or high blood pressure. A number of lifestyle choices can increase your cancer risk by increasing your exposure to carcinogens, and so reducing your ability to reduce your cancer risk in the future. The five main risks are tobacco smoking, regular alcohol consumption (defined as 2 drinks per day or more), diet, physical activity, and sun exposure. Each of these influences your chances of getting certain types of cancer, but each also has several beneficial aspects to consider. For example, drinking alcohol increases HDL levels - good cholesterol - while diet reduces bad cholesterol levels. Physical activity promotes strong bones and protects against osteoporosis. Sun protection helps protect skin from UV radiation and vitamin D. Both these are important for protecting you against skin cancer. You should stay active and eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruit and vegetables.

But when I visited my dentist for this procedure, I found out he had been using it for years and didn't have any problems with his teeth or gums. Can you please help? A: It seems most dentists are using it on their patients without telling them and they don't realize how long the use has really caused damage. This is why, if you find out someone's used it since they were young and haven't done anything wrong then it may be OK but if they're in the middle of serious dental work, then it's probably not worth doing at all.

Some of them may not know what MS is and have no idea that they are affected by it. Others may think you have a broken arm or leg - and it's okay to let them do this because they'll just get over it in time.

Most people with MS have lost some function and cannot walk for extended periods of time and therefore, have very limited social life and work experience. However, we don't have many options when it comes to work-related disabilities. The last thing that someone who has been diagnosed with MS needs is for their employers to take away what little independence they still have. We've already seen examples where people have been told that their disability means they can only wear high heels on the job. And if you're disabled as a result of being born with Down syndrome then perhaps your employers should give you an easier working environment so that you can enjoy more independence. There have been times during my career when I've had to leave jobs early due to illness but I was always given plenty of support when I returned from maternity leave.

Ketosis, which is the state in which your body burns fat as its main source of fuel, can lead to dangerous complications if you are insulin resistant and have type 2 diabetes (i.e., your pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin). It has also been shown that there are more risks associated with low-carb diets than with higher carb diets, especially when it comes to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, consuming very large amounts of carbohydrate will actually impair insulin sensitivity even further; this means that if you consume too many carbohydrates during a high-fat/low-protein/moderate-calorie diet, you'll actually experience greater fluctuations in blood sugar. The bottom line is that you should definitely consider having someone with diabetes monitor your glucose levels, because you may need extra help or support in these situations.

Prenatal care

Q. What is prenatal care?

A. Prenatal care refers to the medical care offered during a woman's pregnancy at her first antenatal visit, before she knows whether she is pregnant or not. This may include things like check-ups and tests that are important for your baby's health. The following types of services are offered to women who have just been diagnosed with gestational diabetes: blood test for glucose (blood sugar) level, ultrasound, and amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. These medical appointments can be arranged by your physician's office.


In addition, you will receive a list of prenatal vitamins and supplements along with advice on what you need during and after your pregnancy. In order to avoid being left without necessary medications due to the fact that some medication do not come in the form you need, it is recommended that you consult with your doctor about the type of medication and dosage that should be taken for your specific case.


Q. When do I start my prenatal care?

A. It depends upon how far along into the pregnancy you are. Some women go into labor within 3 weeks. Others take longer. You'll want to talk with your healthcare provider about your personal situation so you know which day you're going to give birth.


If you are planning on having a homebirth, discuss this with your provider beforehand so they can help you decide when and where you would want to deliver. Be sure to bring plenty of clothing, snacks and toys if there will be any change diapers (if needed), and provide extra towels, bottles, pacifiers, formula and breast milk to nurse on while you wait for your delivery date.


For many women, their initial visit to the doctor is the easiest part of their pregnancy. If there are no major concerns, then it's time to move onto the next stage of care. Your provider may ask you questions such as:

• How many people will be accompanying me for my appointment?

• How soon will we schedule our second appointment?

• Will I see my OB/GYN again after this visit?

• Are there any particular foods I should avoid during my pregnancy?

• Do I have any pre-existing conditions?

What Causes Multiple Sclerosis?""Multiple Sclerosis"" is a term used to describe two distinct forms of neurological disease in humans. The first form is primary progressive MS (PPRMS), in which the individual with the condition gradually loses control over muscle movement and function. This usually happens by age 30, but in some cases, the disease might not show its full effects until later in life. In contrast, secondary progressive MS occurs after someone has already developed PPRMS. Although this kind of MS tends to take longer to develop than PPRMS, it also appears much more rapidly. Secondary progressive MS is most often caused by another autoimmune disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. It is also possible for both types of MS to occur together. There is no cure for either form of the disease, although treatment for each type can help reduce the severity of symptoms. A thorough understanding of how MS works will enable you to understand what is happening to your body, particularly when a person is experiencing multiple symptoms at once.\r

How Is Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosed?\r

Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPRMS): PPRMS results from an immune response against brain cells known as oligodendrocytes. These nerve cells secrete substances that promote inflammation throughout the body. When this inflammatory process goes too far, PPRMS can result in scarring within the brain tissue itself. Because these areas of the brain have less blood flow compared to other parts of the body, inflammation worsens. When this takes place, some patients experience a variety of symptoms including numbness, tingling and muscle spasms. Other symptoms are limited to particular regions of their bodies, such as fingers or toes that feel slightly off-kilter.

What Is Depression?

Depression is a state of low mood. In general it's characterized by sadness, loss, hopelessness, fatigue, loss of interest in activities once enjoyed, difficulty concentrating, sleep disturbance, decreased energy level, feelings of worthlessness, irritability, social withdrawal, lack of enjoyment, and impaired judgment.[5] There's no cure for this condition. The best way to treat depression is to identify what causes it, learn about its causes and then take steps to alleviate them. For example, you might work on identifying the reasons why your depressed symptoms occur and taking action to change your lifestyle.[6] There are several types of depression and each one has unique characteristics:

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): MDD refers to major depressive episodes, which last at least two weeks. Major depressive disorder is the most common type of depression. It affects more than 15 million adults in America alone. [7]

What is naturopathic medicine?

Naturopathic medicine was developed by Drs. David M. Cooper and Eileen F. Cooper in 1977 as a complementary alternative treatment for cancer patients with high disease-related costs. Because cancer is very difficult to cure, they wanted to create a treatment that could improve overall patient survival rates without resorting to chemotherapy. Naturopathy emphasizes self-healing and homeopathy; its practitioners believe the body is made up of trillions of living cells called ""endothelial tissue"" which needs no outside help to heal itself. This healing process occurs through the removal of toxins that cause disease such as cancerous tumors through the application of specific substances derived from plants or animals (vitamins, minerals, enzymes) applied externally or internally. These therapies are delivered through a number of treatments including herbal remedies, massage, osteopathic manipulative procedures, acupuncture, reflexology and dietary therapy. In the United States today, naturopaths perform many different types of examinations such as pap smears, colonoscopies, urinalysis, endoscopy and x-rays.

Naturopaths prescribe drugs when they can't find herbs or other natural remedies that work well enough to treat their patients' illnesses. They may use various combinations of prescription drugs together to achieve their desired results. For example, naturopaths may combine aspirin with vitamin C to reduce symptoms caused by inflammation. However, because these drugs are both powerful antioxidants, they increase the risk of developing certain cancers, so naturopaths recommend avoiding them altogether until patients have been evaluated by a physician.

I have been asked this question more than once. The answer is simple but it takes some time to put into practice. It's a long-term plan that you need to follow if you are going to take the first step.

Step #1) Identify your needs

The things that people with BPD want from life include safety, meaning their family will be OK, meaning they won't be alone, meaning they can trust and depend on other people, meaning they will get what they want/need in relationships, meaning they are safe and loved and they feel better about themselves. Your relationship to others has to be compatible with all of those needs. That means for the foreseeable future you should do everything you can not to hurt or endanger others.

Some people say that it doesn't matter whether someone does or does not have BPD - it's how they act when they're around others that counts. But my experience tells me that that just isn't true. There are many people who will make an effort to control and protect others while still hurting them. The most common example that comes up is being abused by someone close to them because they believe that this makes them ""special."" That behavior needs to stop immediately. If you know someone has this tendency then try as best as possible to keep them away from vulnerable people. And you must continue to work at reducing any harmful behaviors (by talking with them regularly, finding out why they behave this way, correcting their actions, etc.) and keeping them safe.

For many people with BPD they also see situations where their needs aren't met (e.g., someone else leaves without saying goodbye). This is called abandonment and it can cause great distress because these people may think there is nothing wrong with abandoning someone. When that happens, it's important to remember that BPD individuals often view abandonment differently from other people; instead of thinking that it's unacceptable or unhealthy to abandon another person, they tend to blame the other person, even though the other person was responsible for leaving and could easily have made alternative arrangements. They may believe that the person they abandoned wants to harm them or leave again or, sometimes, they don't understand how or why the abandonment happened. So when a person is experiencing abandonment, it's very important to look carefully into why they felt unloved and misunderstood. You might find that a lot of these feelings are related to feeling like they were never accepted in the social world; however, this is something you'll have to",114,borderline personality disorder symptoms,-10.646615028381348,74,question,8,0.6851851851851852,435,0

Question: What is the cause of chronic fatigue and what is its onset? Answer: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a multi-systemic illness characterized by extreme exhaustion, sleep disturbance, muscle pain, fatigue, depression and cognitive dysfunction. It has been estimated that about half of all patients with ME/CFS have some degree of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The term ""Chronic Fatigue"" was coined by the National Institute of Health in 1989 to describe this complex syndrome. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this condition affects approximately 500,000 people in America and may be responsible for up to 15 percent of all disability payments made by Medicare and Medicaid. About one out of six Americans will develop some form of ME/CFS during their lifetime. The symptoms vary from person to person but include excessive fatigue, poor concentration, sore throat, malaise or fatigue, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. The most common manifestations are gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, constipation, abdominal bloating and nausea. There may also be neurological symptoms such as numbness, tingling, weakness, difficulty moving, and trouble speaking. Some sufferers experience recurrent headaches, which can last several days. Although it's difficult to distinguish between an autoimmune and infectious process, there is evidence that many cases involve both. Common symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis include fatigue and muscle spasms, particularly on one side of the body. The primary clinical diagnosis includes a combination of fatigue, joint pain, neuropsychological impairment, speech difficulties, blurred vision, difficulty walking or balance problems, and other neurologic signs. A number of studies suggest that MS is more likely to occur if someone has had a history of CFS. About 40% of those diagnosed with CFS eventually develop MS. The exact reason why some sufferers develop MS while others do not isn't clear, but researchers think that both conditions result from disturbances in immune system function.

The US Heart Association recommends that you eat two servings of fruits and vegetables per day. That's 1 cup of whole fruit and 4 ounces of dried fruit each day, both from fresh fruit. Eat one serving of dairy each day or less than half an ounce of cheese, yogurt, ice cream, butter or other dairy products. The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics says that saturated fats have been shown to raise cholesterol levels in some people. In general, there is more evidence of harm associated with red meat and processed meats than fat from plant sources. The only exception seems to be omega-3 fatty acids, which may prevent sudden cardiac death and other symptoms related to atherosclerosis. However, most studies seem to support the idea that these beneficial compounds make up part of our overall intake rather than playing a major role. Also note that even though vegetable oils have high concentrations of unsaturated fats, because we often use them as salad dressings or cooking oil, their total amount of unsaturated fats is quite small compared with the amounts of saturated fats we consume.

gpt2-xl_57,"multiple sclerosis has four types of stages, and each stage is characterized by a different disease process. Multiple sclerosis (MS) begins with the initial brain inflammation. The central nervous system becomes inflamed because of an overactive immune response triggered by an abnormal reaction in the body's own cells called autoimmunity. This inflammation also leads to the death of white blood cells that normally protect against infection. Once this inflammatory process overwhelms the healthy part of the immune system, an autoimmune attack can begin. These ""autoantibodies"" are actually toxins produced by the body's own cell defenses against the foreign substance or material invading the skin or other tissues. Autoimmune reactions can destroy healthy tissue as well as damage the body's own cells. MS occurs when these harmful substances enter the bloodstream and cause damaging antibodies to be made. When they get into the spinal fluid where the nerve fibers originate from, they activate specific nerves throughout the body that send pain signals to your brain. An area called the trigeminal nucleus sends sensory information to the brain about the touch sensation, but not all sensations will trigger a response within the brain. For some people, a particular sense may only react to certain stimuli, like heat or cold. In MS patients, it seems that these triggers become more common.

It is possible for someone who has never had MS to develop the condition later on, after having already been diagnosed with another serious disability or illness such as cardiovascular disease or cancer.

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) has many different names in different countries. Most often, however, people refer to it simply as MS. It affects 1% of Americans age 20-69 years old, but it affects far more than that population. It is estimated that at least half a million Americans have MS. Another estimate puts the number between 800,000 and 2 million. There is no way of knowing how much MS affects other populations because most research so far has focused primarily on people in the United States. Some estimates even say that as many as 10% of the world's total population has MS, meaning that approximately 600 million people around the globe could potentially be affected.",57,multiple sclerosis stages phases,-0.3095294237136841,2,question,8,0.00966183574879227,419,6

The role of depression in sleep apnea

Q: Is there evidence that chronic sleep-disordered breathing (CDB) leads to major depressive episodes or affective disorder, like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder?\u003cAnswer: Evidence from clinical studies suggests that CDB does not produce major depressive symptoms but rather has an adverse effect on mood. There is also some evidence that the development of anxiety can be delayed by controlling the amount of oxygen consumed during sleep.

Sleep apnea is the most common cause of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). It occurs when air passes through the throat too rapidly, causing the muscles to relax while inhaling. OSA affects more than 30 million Americans, about one percent of the population, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Nearly all cases are related to tobacco use and obesity, although it's commonly misdiagnosed as narcolepsy. Many people who suffer from sleep apnea do so because they have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which causes airflow obstruction, leading to slow respiration. About 25% of those affected have a mild form of sleep apnea; 75% are severe cases. People with asthma and other respiratory conditions often develop OSA, especially if their airways become blocked by scar tissue. A small study published in 2015 found that patients with COPD had the highest rates of daytime sleepiness in the United States, followed by smokers with no chronic diseases.

Sleep apnea may result in depression, but whether this translates into suicide attempts remains unknown. In a 2007 paper in the Journal of Affective Disorders, researchers analyzed data from two large epidemiologic surveys that included nearly 5 million respondents. They found that among adults with mental health problems, there was an increased risk of suicide attempt in those with sleep apnea compared to nonusers. However, only 13 suicides were attributed to sleep apnea out of over 1.3 million deaths overall. This finding is consistent with previous research showing that both mental and physical health problems are highly prevalent in depressed individuals, and suggest that depression alone may contribute to suicidal behavior. Suicide ideation is another possible factor in these cases.

Symptoms of depression can occur in response to sleep apnea. Some people feel tired and listless when their breathing becomes shallow. Other people experience excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating at",93,Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?,-0.1684325784444809,4,question,8,0.020202020202020204,406,29

The recommended minimum dose is 20 mcg of diphtheria toxoid per kg of body weight (which is about 1/100th of the dosage for adults), but a person's immune system will make up its own tolerance to this vaccine and can tolerate higher doses than indicated. The current average adult dose is 40 mcg, with a range from 2 to 200 mcg; the most common side effects are mild flu-like symptoms, which include fatigue, headache, muscle aches, joint stiffness, and nausea. It should be noted that people who take multiple sclerosis medications have been shown to respond better to two types of vaccines than they do to one type; therefore, it would not be appropriate to use a single vaccine during treatment. In addition, these medicines also prevent the spread of disease, so the risk of getting measles or mumps from receiving more than the usual doses of MMR is extremely low.

Q4: Do I need to wear protection when using cellphones in public places?A: No. The best way to protect yourself against catching any infection while you're sitting on your phone is by paying attention to what you're doing while you're using a mobile device. Many infections don't require antibiotics at all. However, if you think an infection might happen, stop what you're doing immediately, wash hands thoroughly, get an antibiotic prescription right away, and then go to a clinic or doctor's office to get tested. If you have questions about whether a certain product may cause an infection, talk to your healthcare provider.

gpt2-xl_79,"Yes. A parent with MS can transmit the disease (MS) to his or her children and grandchildren by transmitting the MS antibodies that cause the illness, called ""autoantibodies"".

Q: How does this work?\nAnswer: Autoimmune diseases are caused when a person's body is invaded by an abnormal form of bacteria known as an infectious microbe called a pathogen. The immune system then attacks the harmful bacteria, but instead of killing it completely, it creates a reaction by creating antibodies that attack healthy cells in your body. These antibodies can attach themselves to their target and cause inflammation. If enough of these autoantibodies accumulate, the inflammatory response can lead to the symptoms of MS. In some cases, such as those who have multiple sclerosis, the disease itself may not show any signs at all until the immune system has been damaged or weakened.

Q: What causes autoimmune diseases?

A: Bacteria and viruses can trigger an immune response called autoimmunity. This type of inflammation occurs on a cellular level. It usually starts within certain parts of the brain called the central nervous system (CNS). Over time, the immune system can become overactive and cause widespread damage throughout the body. The damage is usually irreversible. When the inflammation reaches the lungs, nose, skin and eyes, the results can be deadly.

Q: Do the symptoms vary from person to person?

A: No. Most people with MS do not experience any major changes in their daily life while they have MS. However, if you develop the debilitating effects of MS, you will notice something different in yourself every day. For example, you might start to have trouble walking or talk normally (dysarthria), lose your balance, feel tired often, or have difficulty speaking. You may also experience problems with vision or hearing, including blurry vision, loss of hearing or difficulty hearing.

Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis: Typical Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis

The most common symptoms of MS include:

Visual disturbances, including blurred vision. The visual field is defined as the area around your eye where images appear sharp and clear. Flashes of light and darkness occur around objects you see or even just inside your field of view.

Changes in muscle control and coordination. Your ability to move your joints becomes impaired, leading to problems with your breathing, bladder control, and speech.

[3] This is a summary of the results from the recent studies that compared prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in men with and without prostate cancer to determine whether there are differences between the groups.[4][5] The studies were conducted by researchers at the University of Utah Health Sciences Center using a large sample size, which included over 1,000 subjects from nine countries who received their information via telephone interviews. All the study participants provided written informed consent before completing the study.[6] The findings showed no significant difference in PSA levels among men with or without prostate cancer.[7] In fact, men with prostate cancer had higher PSA levels than those without prostate cancer even though they were more likely to have disease (although this finding was not statistically significant). However, when all the data were pooled together, only men whose PSA level was over 4 ng/ml had a reduced risk of developing prostate cancer. For these men, ""the relative reduction was estimated to be 34%.""[8] These results confirm previous findings showing an association between elevated PSA levels and high rates of prostate cancer, but they also suggest a possible protective effect in men who do not have any evidence of existing disease.[9] [10]",116,outcome prostate cancer,-8.061999320983887,79,question,8,0.3185483870967742,215,11

Q: What's the worst thing you've done that could have caused MS? Answer: I'm really not sure, but it probably included a bicycle accident as a child, which led to two cracked vertebrae and left me with paralysis of my shoulder blade and neck. The most dangerous time in my life was when I started smoking. Smoking is now pretty much stopped, but back then I smoked every day without stopping! Q: When did you first know you were affected by MS? Answer: My mother died of MS in her early twenties. She was 45 at death. A few months later my father also developed MS. In both cases my father had been diagnosed with MS since childhood but had had no symptoms or progression until his late 30s.


When did you first start having trouble walking? Answer: I began to become ill around age 15. At this point I used to walk for short distances on the weekends. By age 17 I started working long hours, which made my legs tired, so I would get up from sitting in front of the TV and walk half way around my home (about 500m) to the car where we lived. It took me about three weeks each week to do this. This was very tiring - especially because during these walks I didn't sleep well or eat enough. So I gradually increased the distance I walked each week - often to 100-200m. By my mid 20s I was running about an hour everyday. These changes meant my body was more active than normal, therefore my joints were feeling worse and worse. Eventually, in my early 30s, I went to see a GP who referred me to a neurologist. He diagnosed me with Multiple Sclerosis (MS).


How does your daily routine differ from most people?

I walk for longer periods than most people do, including long jogs after work. And when I get home, my usual routine involves driving myself to a local supermarket, returning home, eating lunch at home, going to bed and waking up again at 9am, usually to drive myself there again. Then I go to school or work. Most days I don't get to run more than a mile. But sometimes I'll be forced to drive a couple of times before I can get out of my driveway.

They allow you to stretch your muscles in areas that don't get enough attention when trying to improve your posture and keep you healthy as well! You'll also want to try out this one because it's very similar to the other, but with more emphasis on your backside.

2) Neck Pigeon Pose

Benefits: This is a great exercise to help relieve pressure in your neck and shoulders while working through all the different aspects of your posture. It makes a huge difference in how easy it feels to sit up straight and how stable your spine feels. Additionally, you'll be strengthening those core muscles as well as stabilizing your upper body to ensure that you're not falling over from time to time, which can lead to injury.

How To Do It: Lie face down with your feet flat on the floor and your toes pointed slightly forward. Cross your arms over your chest and pull them away from your ears and look at your hands, palms facing inward. Gently tilt your head and shoulders to the right (toward your hand), then rotate it to the left (toward your hand). Inhale and bring your chin toward your chest until your eyes meet at a 90 degree angle. Hold for 5-30 seconds, repeating 3-5 times. Repeat on the opposite side. For added challenge, do this pose while looking straight ahead, tilting your pelvis upward as if you were about to take off your shoes!

3) Shoulder Tuck Stretch

Benefits: One of the best stretches you can do to strengthen your shoulder complex and increase range of motion for your rotator cuff muscles. This is especially helpful if you have some shoulder pain, or if you struggle to hold onto your dumbbells during your set. If you're new to yoga, start by doing this gentle variation first; make sure to let each movement rest approximately 5-10 seconds before starting again to avoid burnout!

How To Do It: Begin on your mat with both of your hands touching the mat. Slowly bend your elbows so they point directly above you. As you move your elbows towards your sides, slowly draw them back until they touch your wrists. Then repeat the process with your arms extended overhead. Make sure to breathe deeply into your belly every few breaths. Don't worry if you feel any discomfort, as this is a very mild stretch.

Q5-6: Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer outcome\nAnswer: Not applicable.

Risk Factors and Chemotherapy: Cancer is considered to be a disease that arises from the cells of the body, and cancer treatments are directed towards killing the tumor cells in order to cure the patient. However, cancer can arise from any part of the body. It does not matter how old a person is, they may develop or progress to develop cancer later on in life. The following factors have been identified as the most common risk factors for developing cancer: Family history of certain types of cancers: A family history includes all members who have had one or more of their relatives (parents, siblings) die of cancer at some point in time. One of the most important genetic features of cancer is the inheritance of specific gene mutations which can lead to development of particular forms of tumors. This means that certain genes are passed down through generations. While it's not possible to say with certainty whether a woman will get a breast cancer when she is older than 45 years of age, there is little doubt that women younger than this age carry increased risks of developing breast cancer due to inherited genes. Smoking causes breast cancer: In the United States, smoking has long been associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer in women; however, many studies over the last few decades suggest that the link between smoking and breast cancer risk is weaker than previously thought. A number of environmental factors such as physical activity, diet, exposure to sunlight, hormones, and various other lifestyle factors are now being investigated in the search of possible explanations for why people smoke and what impact these factors may have on breast cancer rates. Researchers continue to study these complex issues in an attempt to better understand the relationship between cigarette smoking and breast cancer incidence. Risk factors for prostate cancer include: History of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): If you've ever had BPH, chances are good that your genetics predisposes you to developing prostate cancer by way of the same mechanisms that cause BPH. Men who have undergone surgery to remove a bony mass called a prostate gland, also known as a prostatic adenocarcinoma (PAD), have a higher chance of developing prostate cancer because the removal of PADs results in inflammation within the prostate itself. There are several different ways that inflammation can occur in the prostate leading to cancer formation. Research shows that inflammatory cytokines in the blood stream stimulate growth of normal prostate cells while inhibiting growth of abnormal prostate cells.",117,stage 4 metastatic lung cancer outcome,-1.1183192729949951,21,question,8,0.0846774193548387,435,20

The American Psychiatric Association (APA) defines psychotherapy in their Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV as treatment designed to help people change their mindsets or beliefs about mental health issues. The first version of the DSM was published in 1952, and Psychotherapy has been recognized as an integral part of mental health care since its introduction in 1935.1,2 There are many different types of psychotherapies, but all involve some type of interaction between the clinician and patient.3–5 These can include group sessions, individual counseling, cognitive behavioral therapy, problem-solving techniques, self-help groups, family counseling, etc. Most forms of psychotherapy can be administered individually or in groups, though they may not require this level of training and expertise for the practitioner.4 Some forms of psychotherapy have additional requirements for approval from government agencies, such as passing state licensing boards, which may take time and cost more than other treatments that do not require licensing.6

Psychoeducation is widely accepted as one form of psychotherapy;7 however, there is no consensus on whether it should be considered a valid approach. Some research indicates that psychoeducation can benefit patients with chronic diseases,8 yet others claim it does little to improve outcomes among those with serious conditions like cancer, heart disease, or stroke.9,10 Psychoeducation may increase awareness and understanding of mental illness, but without rigorous scientific evidence it cannot be recommended as a method of treatment.11

What are the benefits of psychotherapy?

As we will see below, there are several reasons why it might be worthwhile to explore psychotherapy in addition to other methods. Here are just three reasons that I believe it may be beneficial to consider psychotherapy when treating various physical illnesses:12

1. Improved quality of life

Studies have found improvements in quality of life after psychotherapy.13 For example, a 2012 study found that a 20-minute session of psychotherapy for children diagnosed with asthma improved their symptoms significantly more than placebo (placebo consisted of water).14 Furthermore, a 2015 study revealed significant decreases in anxiety, depression, social phobia, perfectionism, anger/hostility, and posttraumatic stress disorder after being treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), compared with MBSR alone.15 In another",53,what is psychotherapy?,-0.1917291134595871,5,question,8,0.027777777777777776,386,5
gpt2-xl_108,"Dysautonomia is defined as the autonomic nervous system dysfunction and associated symptoms that may occur in a patient with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) who have not been diagnosed by a physician. Dysautonomia is also known as autonomic neuropathy, autonomic dysfunction, autonomic imbalance or autonomic impairment. The autonomic nervous system controls all functions of the entire body including digestion, breathing, blood pressure, muscle tone, heart rate and heartbeat. Dysautonomia causes a variety of symptoms including fever, headache, chills, vomiting, dizziness, weakness, poor concentration, difficulty thinking, feelings of anxiety, irritability, depression, loss of appetite and many more. It is often difficult for patients who are experiencing these symptoms to describe what they are feeling because they do not know why their bodies respond differently from other people when they experience these same symptoms. In this article, we will discuss some common questions patients have about dysautonomia and how to better manage them if you are suffering from it.

How does dysautonomia cause symptoms?

The autonomic nervous system regulates every function of your body including digestion, metabolism, respiration, circulation, immune responses, and much more. Dysautonomia can be caused by anything or someone causing an imbalance in the body's regulation of these systems. If there is a disorder where your body lacks certain hormones necessary to regulate your nervous system then your body has issues regulating itself. When this happens, your brain thinks its doing fine but it isn't so your body responds to any situations like you would expect without actually having any problems with regulating itself. Dysautonomia most commonly occurs when there is a lack of certain natural hormones in your body such as thyroid hormone and/or adrenal hormones which are essential for the proper functioning of the central nervous system. This makes sense since the CNS is responsible for controlling a number of functions, including digestion, muscle movement, cardiovascular function, respiratory function, etc.

In CFS, the normal level of thyroid hormones is either too low or too high making the body think that everything is okay. A person with hyperthyroidism will get hypothyroidism which means that the body needs more thyroid hormone than it normally produces. Hypothyroidism can lead to weight gain, lethargy, fatigue, decreased energy levels, hair loss, brittle nails and mood swings. Another example of thyroid hormone imbalance is Hashimoto's disease which is characterized by an overproduction of thyroid hormone leading to elevated thyrox",108,chronic diarrhea short-term memory sweating inability to regulate body temperature heart palpitations dysautonomia,-0.0427793823182582,0,question,8,0.0,395,24

Q: How long does it take to recover from hypoglycemia?\nAnswer: Within 3-4 hours, but this depends on the severity of hypoglycemia and your pre-existing medical condition.

Q: What is the best treatment for type 1 diabetes?\nAnswer: Treatment consists mainly of insulin injections. Other medications such as sulfonylureas (glucotrol), metformin, glucagon, folic acid, cholestyramine are also used in combination with insulin injections to increase blood glucose levels by improving insulin sensitivity. The effectiveness of these treatments depend on several factors including the age at onset and extent of insulin resistance.

Q: Is there a difference between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes? \nAnswer: There is no difference in the complications associated with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

Q: Can I lose weight if I have type 1 diabetes? \nAnswer: You cannot lose weight if you do not have diabetes. Your body needs carbohydrate for energy, and carbohydrates in the form of glucose are stored in cells in your liver. When these cells become deficient in glycogen, they begin using fat instead. This creates a state called ketosis which results in high blood sugar levels and often also seizures, weakness and fatigue. Therefore, losing 5kg of weight will improve your health by preventing severe diabetic ketoacidosis.",45,Can diabetes be cured?,-2.153597116470337,43,question,8,0.3412698412698413,214,3
gpt2-xl_119,"Pain from a tight or bunched-up collarbone.

What is the difference between a collar bone and a collar joint? A collar bone is an extension of the shoulder blade (shoulder socket). It's located directly above the elbow, behind the rib cage. The shoulder joint is found at the junction of the clavicle and scapula bones; it connects to the upper arm bone.

A collar joint is not part of your shoulder but rather is a location that forms when the humerus moves in relation to the hip joint. In most people, this movement happens through the ball of the foot.

Pain from a collar bone occurs because the shoulder has moved too far forward during a flexion phase of the exercise. Because this movement does not occur naturally, you have to consciously create it by holding the weight or using a resistance band for example. In addition, you must be careful not to overstretch the shoulders, which can cause them to become injured as well.

How do I know if my shoulder is a collar bone? If your collar bone feels painful, this may indicate that there is something wrong with your shoulder joint.

Do not rest your arm on a bench! This is just another way of asking yourself if you really need to lift weights to lose weight. And don't think about doing any dumbbell exercises either. Dumbbells will not help you lose fat, and they are very effective at building strength only in short bursts – 10 reps in the gym is all they'll ever need.

What should I do instead? Exercise with a heavy object such as barbell, dumbbell, medicine ball or kettle bell. Also, use resistance bands or weight plates to increase the challenge.

Do not try to stretch your neck after you've finished lifting. Do NOT bend your head sideways while bending over to reach around for something.

What causes Ehlers Danlos Syndrome?

Ehlers Danlos syndrome (EDS), also known as myasthenia gravis syndrome (MGSS), is a chronic disease affecting one in every 100,000 people worldwide. The exact cause is unknown, but there is evidence pointing toward a genetic basis. People with EDS have two distinct types of collagen in their connective tissue, called type 1 collagen and type 2 collagen. Type 1 collagen has a higher density than type 2 collagen and helps support cartilage and bone. However, when this high-density collagen breaks down over time, causing fibrosis, it leads to the formation of scar tissue around joints, which can lead to joint pain, pitting, and arthritis. In addition, the increased production of collagen that occurs during healing after injury, such as from a fall, can contribute to joint pain. Additionally, people with EDS often develop a condition called osteoporosis because of decreased levels of calcium and phosphorus in their bones. This leads to weaker bone. People with EDS also tend to lose weight due to a decrease in the activity of the hormone ghrelin, which inhibits food intake. Finally, people with EDS often suffer from sleep apnea, or",109,ehlers danlos syndrome POTS nausea stomach pain,-0.1833862662315368,0,question,9,0.0,377,11

Episode #19: How to deal with your friends who don't want to see you happy\ nQuestion: Do people really talk about how they're feeling when you're around them? Answer: Yes! It happens all the time! If someone asks ""How are things?"" chances are you're doing just fine; if someone else says something like ""I'm miserable"" or ""Everything sucks!"" then odds are he or she is trying to sound like a normal person. Don't be afraid to admit that you might need some help if you aren't quite where you'd like to be in life...because even though other people may think you're crazy, you probably ARE crazy.

Episode #20: What makes a great relationship between two guys in high school?\nQuestion: Two guys in high school, how would you describe a good friendship? Answer: A very good one. You go through periods where you might argue, have arguments, but once again, you understand why each other thinks the way we do. We don't judge our friends, because they are people, and that's what friendship should look like. We love to tell stories, laugh at jokes, and discuss our feelings. Our favorite times together are when we've had time away from our families. When we're having problems, we try to work out our issues before taking too much stress on each other. That's when the best friendships come into play.

Stage 1 - No Cancer

This is the first time that a patient has been diagnosed with stage I breast cancer. Patients may have different symptoms and/or more advanced disease than those found in women who have undergone surgery for early stage breast cancers. A complete history will be taken, including any previous medical problems or family histories of breast cancer. The results from blood tests can then be obtained to see if there are any pre-cancerous changes. If a positive test result is observed at this stage, the surgeon will decide whether surgery should be performed.

If the breast biopsy shows no pre-cancerous changes, treatment usually consists of chemotherapy (chemo) and radiation therapy (radiation). Breast cancer patients are typically treated for 6 months after diagnosis. Treatment duration varies depending on the type of breast cancer and how far along it was discovered. It's also important to know that some tumors cannot be removed without significant complications that could lead to death. For example, non-invasive benign nodules are often left untreated as they require very little effort to remove. Many other types of tumors can only be removed surgically.

Treatment can be divided into two stages: early detection and late detection. Early detection occurs before cancer cells spread beyond the breast area. Late detection is when an overabundance of tumor cells causes severe harm to nearby tissues. Radiation therapy is often required in order to kill these dangerous cancer cells which may not be detected until later stages of the disease.

In early detection, the treatments used most frequently include chemo, hormonal therapy, tamoxifen and hormone replacement therapies. In the second stage, chemotherapy is given to destroy all cancer cells and prevent them from spreading further. Some cases are cured by surgical removal of a large portion of the tumors. If treatment fails to eliminate the growths completely, radiation therapy may be considered.

However, it's not an easy decision because each person's situation is different. If you need medication to help control symptoms, talk to your physician about whether this is appropriate.

gpt2-xl_77,"Menopause is the end of menstruation in women, and it's associated with a number of symptoms. This includes tiredness, weight loss (weight gain), fatigue, and mood changes. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease where a person has inflammation of the brain and spinal cord caused by myelin-related proteins called oligodendrocytes that form an insulation around nerve fibers. These proteins are also known as demyelinating oligodendrocyte glycoproteins, or DOGs.

Symptoms from MS can include numbness, tingling, weakness, difficulty swallowing, problems with vision, hearing, balance, coordination, and trouble walking. The disease affects about one out of every 100 people worldwide. It often begins between ages 20 and 50 years old.

In addition to the common symptoms of MS, some people develop symptoms such as numbness on the side of the face, arm, leg, foot or other body part. Symptoms may occur suddenly but usually resolve within 3 months after the onset of menopause.

It's not clear why menopause occurs at different times for each woman but scientists believe that there may be an immune system effect that causes more MS infections during this time. In other words, when women get their periods, they don't have antibodies attacking themselves. During these times, menopausal hormones promote the growth of certain T cells that could lead to more infections. However, this link hasn't been proven yet.

Why might this happen? It's unclear why menopause occurs differently in different populations. For example, it's thought that differences in lifestyle, diet, stress levels, exposure to radiation, and genetic factors contribute to menopause timing. Other possible reasons that make people more susceptible to getting MS later in life, include genetics, age, medications, smoking, alcohol consumption, pregnancy, and hormonal fluctuations that affect how much estrogen you produce in your body.",77,How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?,-0.0593003816902637,0,question,9,0.0,291,16

How many people have a history of any one of these disorders?

I've talked to patients who have had multiple sclerosis, who were still suffering from headaches at age 30, when they died, yet had no record of it on their death certificate. The majority of them lived into their 60s or even 70s with no known history of MS. And those that did develop MS also seem to be living longer than average, so again the incidence is increasing, but there isn't enough data to know how much longer. They could have been misdiagnosed, or could have simply died in middle age from other causes before seeking medical attention.

What about chronic pain?

There seems to be more research into pain management and opioids as treatment for chronic pain. There seems to be evidence showing that opioids may help ease pain without making symptoms worse. This could mean less use of pharmaceutical drugs, reducing opioid dependence (which is an issue), and helping reduce the number of overdose deaths by keeping addicts off heroin. Some researchers believe opioids could help prevent and treat the spread of HIV/AIDS. But this study shows just how little we really understand about the role of opioids in causing chronic illness.

In my opinion, one big reason that we don't know the full extent of opioids' role in chronic illness is because a lot of studies have looked only at short-term use, and not long-term abuse or dependency. We need longitudinal studies in order to get at the true impact that opioids can have on health. Until then, I would recommend against using opioids for chronic illness. A better choice would probably be to avoid all prescription medications altogether, except perhaps if you have severe allergies to food, water, or certain ingredients like coffee. Or for occasional use of opioids such as some forms of asthma medication.

Are you involved in any clinical trials investigating cannabinoids/cannabinoids for treating or preventing chronic illness? If so, can you please describe your involvement in these studies?

Ask about how many teeth you need to replace.

If you don't know the answer and aren't sure which ones you should get, you should consult with a dentist or oral surgeon for an estimate of the number of teeth you'll need to replace. The most common procedure is dentures, but there are other options as well such as partial denture (which requires only the front three or four teeth) and full denture (which requires all five). For example, one person's lower lip could become so painful because his tongue was missing (a condition called ""dental abscess""), while another person's bottom line is that he needs six teeth (a condition called ""cavities""). If you think you may not want to keep any of those, it helps to think about what would happen if you had fewer teeth. You'll probably also want to talk to your doctor about how much surgery will cost and when you'll need to start having treatments.

It's good to know some general tips on dental care, too. For instance, getting the right amount of fluoride in your drinking water can help prevent cavities.

What the Experts Say

The following are comments from physicians and other health care providers on how they use this type of diet to treat or manage patients. These doctors have been asked to write about their experience with this type of diet because it's one of the most frequently requested treatments by those who are trying to improve their condition.

Dr. Richard J. Johnson, MD. ""Ketosis may be more effective than medication for controlling blood sugar levels in some persons."" (Johnson et al., 2005)

""A high-fat/low-carbohydrate diet can induce insulin resistance, which in turn causes hyperglycemia,"" said Dr. Richard J. Johnson, Medical Director of the Center for Diabetes Research at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. He explained that if individuals were unable to control blood glucose levels through regular medication, then using an alternative approach such as this low carbohydrate diet could provide a successful means of achieving weight loss and lowering blood glucose. (Heide, 2004; Johnson & Hoehn, 2009)

Dr. Mary Pappas, DNP, RDN. ""Many people have very high cholesterol levels, but there also seem to be less heart disease cases among those with normal cholesterol levels and higher fasting insulin levels. Low-glycemic index foods help people regulate their blood sugars better than high glycemic load foods. A well-designed low-carbohydrate diet is generally safe and helps reduce the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease,"" she told Medscape Medical News.

Dr. Susanne Romm, PhD, RHC. This nutritionist at the University of California, San Francisco agrees. ""People with diabetes should try a ketogenic diet first before attempting any treatment involving medications. I recommend starting with a relatively moderate amount of carbohydrates like breads and pastries. Then add more slowly into the meal. The goal is to maintain a constant level of carbs, with no spikes. In addition, the body will respond faster to lower carb meals and will produce less insulin. The net effect is rapid weight loss and improved blood sugar control.""

Dr. Kevin Hall, ND, FACC. When he was working with obese children, he often found that when he started them off on a very low-calorie diet, they lost much more weight and felt healthier. ""This diet allowed us to keep their calorie intake low while having a positive impact on their metabolic health—and they maintained the weight loss despite having significant food cravings,"" said Dr.",35,Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?,-0.0665029287338256,3,question,9,0.01935483870967742,392,28

gpt2-xl_98,"How can I tell whether my cervix is dilated or not?

Cervical dilation and effacement (D&E) is a very normal part of the course of pregnancy. It occurs when your body learns to work better with what it's been given by the placenta, increasing blood flow around the cervix, which helps reduce pain. D&E often leads to bleeding and infection, so you need to be careful about handling things that are inserted into the vagina during labor because they might cause problems.

Can I have cervical dilation if I am pregnant?


Yes, but the chances of having symptoms related to dilation after the birth is high. Most women will start experiencing vaginal bleeding within 5-7 days after delivery, sometimes much sooner.

Pregnancy is more likely to lead to painful intercourse during this time than at any other point in their lives. If you're concerned that this may be happening for you, talk to your doctor. It could be due to a problem with your cervix. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that you wait 24 hours before using tampons. They also suggest wearing sanitary pads as soon as possible once you feel full-term.

The most common complication from cervical dilation is expulsion of an object. This is usually caused by a finger or pencil passed too close to the opening of the cervix. To make sure no objects get inside of you, use only clean cotton or absorbent underwear whenever you touch your labia during sex. Tampons should stay out while you're sitting down on your toilet. You shouldn't use anything else until you've finished urinating.

What do I do if I want to take precautions to prevent dilation?

In some cases, it's important to keep your cervix open longer than usual to avoid complications such as an abscess or a tear. However, other women don't even notice when they have a long cervix. Since it doesn't affect you, you should feel free to go ahead and let yourself become pregnant without worrying about dilating your uterus.

You may experience discomfort during or immediately after giving birth, especially if you've had a caesarean section. These feelings often fade fairly quickly and there aren't many ways to treat them. Try taking ibuprofen or acetaminophen if they give you headache or nausea.

gpt2-xl_63,"Yes, MS can impact your job prospects and productivity. The symptoms of the disease are subtle to those who do not have it but can be quite debilitating for those with the condition. However, people with MS can work in many different positions including physicians, nurses, architects and engineers. A number of jobs are particularly vulnerable to MS as they require a combination of physical strength, fine motor skills and mental agility that patients may experience with some frequency in their careers. For example, someone suffering from MS who is working as an electrician might find that he or she cannot perform such tasks as disconnecting electric power lines due to pain and discomfort. Additionally, the inability to drive could pose problems, if you own your own car but have trouble moving around on your feet while driving due to fatigue. It is important to remember that even though MS affects a person's ability to work, these conditions will not cause you to lose your job or make your salary drop significantly. Although employers may have difficulty finding qualified applicants with the required skill set for certain jobs, there are several ways to mitigate any potential negative effects. First, make sure that you get regular check-ups by your doctor and other health care providers for all areas of your body. Also, ensure that you are following up with your employer regularly so that you are properly informed about all procedures needed when you return to work. Some employers will pay extra attention to employees who have had MS symptoms as well as those who have had recent changes in their lives. Finally, while you should maintain good relationships with coworkers, avoid gossiping about anyone unless you know for sure that this is not going to be done out of malice or spite. If you suspect the rumor has been spread to hurt someone's feelings then politely bring it to their attention before making another big deal about it, and try to keep things quiet until it is no longer affecting others.

Q: How is MS diagnosed?\nAnswer: Typically, individuals who suffer from MS first notice the symptoms during middle age (50 years old), and they can develop the illness at any time between ages 15 and 60 (usually between 40 and 50). People who live into their 70s and 80s usually experience the onset of a more severe form of the disease which includes impaired coordination, muscle weakness and sometimes blindness or paralysis. Diagnosis of MS often depends on the history and physical exam findings given by a physician. While most doctors agree that it is difficult to diagnose MS in children because they are often misdiagnosed with a variety of medical conditions, they also point",63,Will multiple sclerosis affect my career?,-0.0033080638386309,0,question,9,0.0,455,2

The main findings from this study were that there was a positive correlation between the duration of cannabis use and the risk of MS. In addition, the findings showed that the overall cumulative exposure to cannabis users (perceived) increased with increasing duration of use and that the cumulative dose per person could be used as an indicator of cumulative risks of developing MS. The results are consistent with those reported by other researchers who have studied the relationship between smoking cannabis and MS in different populations [2]. The authors concluded that ""the present data suggest that the presence of at least one lifetime episode of cannabis use is associated with an increased incidence of MS"". Furthermore they stated that ""the current findings should not lead to the conclusion that it is safe or advisable for people to smoke cannabis as a daily habit without regard to its possible effect on human health"" [8]. This report has been challenged by some researchers because although it does show that the prevalence of heavy cannabis use was higher among patients with MS than healthy controls, the authors had failed to examine whether the association was causal, which is critical in determining causality. Other studies have looked into the causal nature of the association but have found no convincing evidence of causation either way; instead, they have indicated that both genetic and environmental factors are likely involved [1,3,4]

Conclusion: The results of our study do indicate an association between cannabis use and the development of MS. It also appears that many of these symptoms may be caused by another disease process such as rheumatoid arthritis rather than being directly due to cannabis use. However, there is still some ambiguity about the mechanism whereby cannabis causes MS since we did not find any direct link between cannabis use and immune responses.

gpt2-xl_54,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that results from an imbalance between myelin sheath and axon. It usually begins in childhood or adolescence as a neurologic disease with symptoms that are similar to those of other chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. MS has also been called Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS).

A number of factors may increase your risk for developing MS, including exposure to toxic substances during pregnancy; genetic predisposition; inherited factor(s); immunosuppression; malnutrition; infections; and certain environmental exposures, particularly smoking. Smoking increases the likelihood of developing MS by suppressing the production of interleukin (IL)-10, which plays a role in the body's immune response. IL-10 is produced by macrophages in your lungs when you breathe. This suppression prevents your body's natural defense mechanisms against infection from working properly. As a result, bacteria can enter into your bloodstream and cause inflammation that leads to MS. The increased risk of getting MS in smokers could be attributed to their decreased ability to produce IL-10.

What happens if I develop MS? If you have MS, you might experience several of these signs and symptoms. You might also experience some of the following complications: disability;

muscle weakness;

seizures;

convulsions (fits);

psychosis (delusions), especially hallucinations;

arthritis/joint pain; and

visual impairment (blindness). These complications are related to both physical and mental impairments associated with MS. The extent of your impairment will depend on how severe your MS is, how long you have had it, and whether you are taking medications for this condition. In addition, all patients who develop symptoms and signs of MS should be evaluated by a physician. An evaluation includes evaluating your medical history, asking about current treatment options, examining you closely using a variety of techniques such as special tests and MRIs, conducting laboratory studies, and performing imaging studies. A complete examination should include reviewing your neurological exam, checking blood pressure, measuring your heart rate, and looking at other signs and symptoms.

What causes MS? Scientists still do not know what triggers MS and why it occurs. They believe that MS develops over time due to changes within your brain cells. Some experts think that the major trigger may be the environment you live in.

Question: Is there a correlation between MS and high cholesterol? Answer: No. If an individual has either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, they can have elevated blood lipids because their body is producing insulin, which in turn helps control blood sugar levels. There is no evidence that patients with MS have elevated cholesterol levels. However, if someone has high triglycerides (fats), then they may be at risk for developing MS. A healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and fish oil are recommended by health care providers.

It has been determined by others that some people are genetically predisposed to developing MS. For example, patients who carry mutations in genes for a protein called interleukin-10, which helps protect the immune system from invading the body's own tissues, have an increased risk for developing multiple sclerosis. Other researchers believe that genetic factors also play a role in many cases of MS. However, much research still needs to be done to understand the exact relationship between genetics and MS.

Q: What is the difference between Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson's Disease?

A: The primary differences between MS and PD are that MS generally affects individuals in their 20s to 60s while the majority of PD occurs at a younger age. In addition, the main symptom of both disorders involves problems relating to movement (a tremor) or balance (balance disturbances), whereas the symptoms of either type of motor neuron disease typically involve weakness on one side of the body. Although this distinction is important, it doesn't really explain why these diseases occur in different populations. As mentioned above, even within the same family, there is variation in susceptibility to MS and PD. There are also differences in how the cells are affected, including differences in whether they produce myelin, the protective insulation around nerve fibers; whether they use cholesterol, copper, iron or other substances that influence the ability of those nerves to communicate properly; and whether they produce proteins called amyloid plaques or tau tangles, which accumulate around nerve cells. Some scientists think these differences could account for why the disease occurs differently among different ethnic groups. They say that the white population tends to have higher levels of the ""bad"" protein associated with PD and a lower level of the ""good"" proteins involved in",92,causes of fatigue in MS,-6.890380382537842,42,question,9,0.1875,397,25

How Do We Get High Cholesterol? There are two ways that we can get cholesterol:

Our bodies make cholesterol when we absorb food containing cholesterol. Our liver makes this cholesterol in response to eating foods containing cholesterol.

In each case, the cholesterol gets into our blood vessels and tissues where it accumulates in our cells, including the walls of our arteries.

This accumulation occurs as our cholesterol levels rise. If the level rises too quickly, however, we experience the symptoms of hypercholesterolemia and heart disease—like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, swollen hearts and arteries and hardening of the arteries.

The Causes of High Cholesterol Levels

Cholesterol is made by the body when we ingest foods rich in cholesterol. When these foods enter our system, some of the cholesterol passes through our intestines and ends up inside the fat cells located there",22,my risk for developing type 2 diabetes,-5.586404800415039,126,question,9,0.504,401,5

gpt2-xl_57,"multiple sclerosis stages are usually divided into the following three stages: 1. inflammatory phase; 2. immune-mediated stage; and 3. neurodegenerative stage. (1) inflammation is characterized by uncontrolled release of proteins, cytokines and other substances from cells, which may cause an increase in proinflammatory enzymes such as COX-2 and IL-6; this leads to a cascade of events leading to cell death or tissue damage. This can occur via either apoptosis (programmed cell death), necrosis (death without cell death) or invasion of the central nervous system into brain tissues. There are many factors involved with various types of MS (e.g., type of T cell receptor that the cell expresses, duration of the disease, number of neurons damaged at one time point and so on). It is believed that a single factor cannot be responsible for most types of MS. (2) Immune mediated is thought to represent a major part of multiple sclerosis pathology. In fact, immunological changes in the CNS can lead to the onset of MS. However, it is unclear whether autoimmune destruction of myelin sheaths and/or myelination is more frequent in patients with progressive versus relapsing forms of MS. These findings suggest that some of these changes can be initiated during or after the first episode of the disease. (3) Neurodegeneration represents a new aspect of multiple sclerosis since the initial focus was on immune involvement in MS. The role of neurotrophic factors has been studied mainly through their effect on oligodendrocytes, microglia and astrocytes and their regulation. Although there is evidence suggesting that some of these effects have a direct impact on the initiation of symptoms in different phases of MS, it is also possible that alterations of neuronal development might be responsible. Nevertheless, neurodegenerative changes occurring early in the course of multiple sclerosis appear to play a critical role in the progression of the disease and result in a significant loss of function in the motor circuits of the brain.

The disease appears to change according to its stage of occurrence, i.e. the incidence of relapse increases at higher levels of severity (see below). This suggests that the disease is not fixed but dynamic in nature.

Sleep Apnea is another problem that affects people with MS. It is characterized by repeated pauses or interruptions in breathing. Sleep apnea causes daytime drowsiness and often results in reduced mobility.

Symptoms of Sleep Problems in MS

People with MS experience a range of symptoms related to fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, difficulty concentrating, mood swings, memory problems, and more. However, in most cases, these problems occur alongside a host of other conditions such as depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, digestive issues, arthritis, and so on. Some people also develop chronic illnesses like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, or metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes. As mentioned above, many people who have MS report having more than one sleep disorder. They may be experiencing one particular disorder while still experiencing others. To make matters worse, different types of sleep disorders cause different effects. Although everyone has different patterns, one common symptom pattern seen in many people with MS is the following:

1) Insomnia – Difficulty staying alert and focused throughout the day. Sometimes this can result in being late to work or school.

2) Restlessness/Anxiety - Feelings of nervousness, fear, or excitement that arise throughout the day. These feelings may come from things like nightmares, hearing voices, having panic attacks, seeing objects out of focus or moving too fast, or feeling trapped in small spaces. A sleep disorder, whether caused by insomnia or anxiety, could increase these feelings.

Why You Should Have The Vaccine

How It Works

The Covid-19 vaccine is a live virus (virus that can replicate in your body) that has been weakened or killed by heat and pressure in order to produce an injectionable form of the disease-causing agent. As with all vaccines, you get the ""live"" product inactivated in your body before it's made into its injected, cure-all form.

Who Gets The Vaccine Injections?

Children younger than 6 months old who have had two doses of the same influenza strain and are at risk from influenza are eligible for this vaccine. This includes those who:

Are hospitalized or may become hospitalized due to respiratory illnesses caused by the A(H3N2) virus.


Have close contact with patients who were infected with the H1N1 virus or the C959 virus. If you have close contact with someone who was sickened by either virus, talk to them about getting vaccinated. For more information on influenza viruses and their symptoms, please visit Fluoridealert.org

If you are traveling abroad and you will be staying with an individual who recently traveled outside of the United States, ask them if they would like to receive the vaccine or if they need additional time to recover before they travel. There may also be questions regarding vaccination during pregnancy. Contact CDC for more details.

What Are The Side Effects Of The Vaccination?

All children who received the vaccine developed mild upper respiratory tract illness (nasal congestion), fever (temperature less than 100.4 F or 38.8°C), headache, muscle aches, and rash. Some children reported neck stiffness. Children under 2 years old who got the vaccine had no significant side effects.

Most people don't experience serious side effects. Most common side effects include soreness or redness at the site where the injection was given. Other side effects include low energy or sleepy feeling. Serious allergic reactions (including eye swelling, itching, skin rash, hives, difficulty breathing, trouble swallowing, coughing up blood, or wheezing) have been reported rarely. However, these can happen even after receiving the recommended number of shots within 24 hours.

Is Anyone Getting Sick From The Vaccine?

gpt2-xl_79,"This is a very important question, and there are some circumstances that may help with this. If you have multiple sclerosis and your child has the disease or an affected parent or sibling, they may be able to pass it on if you're not careful. The most common way to do this is by using an enzyme called Factor VIII (FVIII) to repair damaged DNA in your body. However, sometimes this isn't possible. Other people who inherit genetic mutations that cause multiple sclerosis can pass their genes for the condition onto their children. In these cases, the child's mother or father could pass the gene on as well. It's also possible to pass the disease to another person through blood transfusions. Ask your doctor about whether FVIII therapy might be appropriate for you and your family.

Q: How often should my child have his/her spleen biopsied?\nAnswer: Spleen biopsy is usually done every three years, but occasionally it's recommended at least once more. When spleen biopsies are performed, a small amount of fluid is removed from around the edge of the abdomen under local anesthesia. During the procedure, doctors remove cells that are likely causing symptoms, such as inflammation, scarring, or nodules. These cells are then sent to a lab for analysis. Your child will need to go home after the procedure so that he or she won't have any complications. The length of time your child needs to stay home depends on how severe the symptoms are. Most patients return within two weeks, but it's important to keep track of the results of your son or daughter's test so that you can monitor treatment progress. Tell your physician if your child's spleen is clear or cloudy, or if you feel uncomfortable during the procedure because of discomfort caused by the needle. It's also a good idea to let your physician know if any symptoms appear while your child is being treated.",79,Can I pass multiple sclerosis to other family members?,-0.0061216945759952,0,question,9,0.0,321,21

gpt2-xl_130,"Shoulder Flexion.

Q: Is the lower back too tight? Answer: Yes, it is. If you are doing yoga, you will see that there is a lot of emphasis on stretching the upper part of the body (back) while the shoulders are still in place. When you first start out with this type of exercise, your shoulders may feel very tense after you stretch them. They need to relax so they can be more flexible and able to move as freely as possible. You should also be able to use one or both arms to provide support for each other at all times when performing these exercises.

A good way to work toward releasing tension and allowing flexibility in the lower back, but not in the shoulders, is to make sure the head and neck are relaxed. In fact, I recommend keeping a tennis ball under your chin for 30 seconds before every set of these poses, especially if you have had problems with muscle knots in the past. The key is to keep the neck relaxed throughout the entire routine. To do this simply hold a light ball between the thumb and index finger of each hand, without moving your head or eyes from side-to-side. This allows you to use gravity to help release the knots that have been building up over time. Try this anytime, anywhere, as long as you are working towards proper alignment of the spine. Do NOT try to force yourself into a certain position by pushing hard against any of the points of resistance; this is counterproductive. For example, try lying face down and holding a light tennis ball between the thumb and index finger of each hand. Just let go of the ball slowly without trying to squeeze it like a ball. Let gravity take care of all that and then pull up on the ball as much as you want. By gradually easing the pressure off the balls, you will find that it becomes easier to get into proper alignment. If you don't notice how easy it is to become more relaxed just by relaxing your hands and letting gravity take care of it, you aren't practicing relaxation enough! Relaxation is what keeps us healthy.

The results showed that the number of patients with high-grade disease (5+ lesions) was increased in both groups, while the numbers of patients with low-grade disease remained constant between the two groups. However, there were significant differences between the two study groups, as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. The mean survival time for these patients who did not receive chemotherapy was 20 weeks in the group receiving CIMT and 21 weeks in the group treated with radiation alone. Those who received a combination of radiotherapy plus CT after initial treatment had a shorter survival than those who received only one therapy. This may be because the combination of treatment modalities can improve the overall prognosis of the patient. Additionally, the researchers believe it is possible that the use of CT in conjunction with chemotherapy has been shown to reduce tumor burden by increasing cell turnover and decreasing apoptosis. These findings suggest that combining the treatment modality could increase tumor regression rates which would likely lead to better overall outcomes. A large randomized trial to determine whether this strategy actually leads to improved outcomes is needed.

Dr. Robert Wagers, Director of Clinical Trials at Dana Farber Cancer Institute said: ""We are very pleased to have found an innovative and potentially game changing approach to treating advanced nonmetastatic breast cancer using two different chemotherapies.""

In total, 30 men and women underwent radiation and/or chemotherapy combined with PET scans at least once every 6 months. All participants received standard care including adjuvant medical care and surgery. Patients were followed up until death or December 31, 2010. The majority of the patients developed early-stage breast tumors which were localized within the breasts. In addition, 7% of the subjects experienced high grade disease and 25% of the subjects developed late-stage disease. There were no deaths from cancer during the 8 years of followup. Overall, 80% of the patients responded to either the radiation or chemotherapy treatments, but most responses occurred within 3 years following completion of treatment. Of the 10 patients who died, all were experiencing late-stage disease at the time they died.

Question: swollen lymph node(s) and swollen veins

Answer: yes, especially if you're taking corticosteroids

Question: swollen lymph node(s) but no swelling of the vein is it possible to drain a lymphedema cyst? Answer: yes, without surgery it's possible (especially if you have arthritis). You should see your doctor. Lymphedema is an inflammation of the tissues that surround your organs. It can be caused by conditions such as diabetes or certain medications. Your doctor will check for any underlying causes of lymphedema. You may need medical treatment if you already have one. The most common causes include: Aortic valve disease – This condition affects the valves that control blood flow in the arteries which supply the heart and brain. Other symptoms include low blood pressure (hypotension), chest pain, and shortness of breath (pulmonary edema).

– This condition affects the valves that control blood flow in the arteries which supply the heart and brain. Other symptoms include low blood pressure (hypotension), chest pain, and shortness of breath (pulmonary edema). Diabetes – Diabetes leads to high levels of sugar in your bloodstream and excess insulin production, both of which can cause enlargement of body fluids. As the pancreas becomes less sensitive to signals from the stomach and intestines, the amount of sugars stored in the liver increases. As this happens, fat cells are added to the fatty deposits on the inside of your walls, making them more prominent. This process causes abnormal fluid retention and can also increase the risk of developing other diseases related to liver function such as cirrhosis. This can happen with people who are not overweight. However, there is evidence that fatty deposits associated with diabetes are common among obese individuals (see pictures above).

gpt2-xl_45,"Yes, it can. But not without a major effort to change our lifestyle.

Diabetes is like cancer in that it takes many different factors to cause it. The good news is that there are several things we can do to slow the progression of this disease. You may have heard this before but I'm going to repeat it because I think everyone needs to know it. If you continue on your current diet and exercise routine for more than 2 years (and even longer), then you will likely improve. What does improve depends upon how quickly you address the underlying causes of the condition. It's very important to start with a clean slate when considering these changes because the old habits won't go away as easily as they used to.

The most common reason people stop doing what works for them is because their current lifestyle doesn't work anymore or it no longer suits the body type that causes the disease to develop. So before making any significant changes, determine if what you currently eat/exercise is working for you. One way to do so would be to measure insulin levels after changing your eating habits and exercise patterns. Another way is by doing something like the following:

1) Have an IV line inserted into one of the main blood vessels in the body for 3 weeks. Measure your fasting blood sugar at least every day during this time. Monitor for side effects such as headaches or dizziness. A drop in blood sugar occurs around 90 minutes after meals; this may take up to 24 hours to occur.

2) Take 10 grams of insulin once daily for three days. Insulin is stored in storage sites throughout the body in fat cells which are the fastest growing organ system. This means that if you're overweight or obese, you need to lose weight or at least stay close to the recommended 25% calorie restriction. Make sure to use pure glucose rather than dextrose or maltodextrin, since dextrose has additives added to make it appear healthier. Your doctor can prescribe 100-200 mcg of glucomannan per day. This should provide sufficient insulin for 3 months, depending upon age and medical history.

3) Increase caloric intake 50-100% over the baseline by increasing total calories, carbohydrates, protein, fats and/or adding extra fruit, vegetables and whole grains.

4) Change your exercise program and activity level. Choose activities that offer the greatest physical challenge with minimal recovery time. These include swimming laps, walking briskly, stair climbing and jogging. Exercise should be done",45,Can diabetes be cured?,-0.1920190900564193,22,question,9,0.1746031746031746,423,5

Q. How do I know if my symptoms are due to POTS?


A. Symptoms of POTS can be caused by many factors, including dehydration, low potassium, excess sodium in the blood, and hyperventilation. But, a recent study found that POTS was most commonly linked to a hormone called renin which controls acid-base balance.2 Renin deficiency may result from decreased production or impaired function of this gland.3 The symptoms of POTS can range from mild fatigue to severe muscle weakness resulting from shortness of breath, constricted airways, and breathlessness. If you have any of these symptoms, or have any questions about them, we recommend consulting your doctor. Q. My symptoms do not seem consistent with POTS and I still suspect that I'm having some sort of underlying problem (such as an eating disorder or thyroid issue). What should I do now?


A. There is no simple test for POTS, so it's difficult to confirm diagnosis. You will need to get more specific information about what's causing your symptoms. For instance, you may want to see your doctor if you notice any changes in how much energy you are using when trying to exercise, how often you fall asleep at night, or if you feel unwell while watching TV. Also, make sure that other people around you who also have POTS don't notice anything unusual. It's hard to diagnose POTS in isolation; thus, it's important to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms before taking a further medical step. Q. Do all people with POTS experience symptoms similar to those described here?


A. According to Dr. Zebis' article ""POTS-An Overview,"" there were 1,004 cases of POTS diagnosed during his period of research between 1974 and 1996.4 Of those people with POTS, 75% had a history of gastrointestinal problems. As shown in Table 5 below, most people with POTS experienced fatigue/fatigue related to the following:1) Difficulty maintaining adequate fluid levels within the body;2) Muscle cramps during exertion or sleep;3) Shortness of breath;4) Nausea;5) Vomiting;6) Excessive sweating;7) Frequent urination;8) Irritability/anger;9) Headache;10) Depression;11) Anxiety;12) Tiredness;13) Changes in sexual desire/performance;14) Un",109,ehlers danlos syndrome POTS nausea stomach pain,-0.4304234087467193,0,question,10,0.0,351,12

Stage 3 Breast Cancer

Q: I had breast cancer in stage three. What is the likelihood of my surviving and living long enough to have a baby? Answer: about 5% probability (5-10%)

Stage 2 Breast Cancer

Q: I had breast cancer in stage two. How long will it take before I can start chemotherapy? Answer: it depends on how quickly you recover from your cancer. It may take up to 6 months after diagnosis for your symptoms to subside, so your treatment could be delayed. But you should still schedule an appointment with your doctor soon after you begin treatment so that they can monitor you closely.

Stage 1 Breast Cancer

The numbers given below are estimates based upon research studies of breast cancers survivors published over the past several decades. The numbers shown for the most common kinds of breast cancer are averages which do not apply to every survivor. Your chance of survival at any one year from the time of diagnosis depends greatly on the type of cancer you have and whether or not you started screening early. Some survivors have died within a few years after being diagnosed.

They will also ensure that you receive appropriate training and support.

Q: What is the range of daily functions you can perform without limitation?\nAnswer: Some areas of daily activity, such as dressing, eating, sleeping, grooming, bathing, reading, writing, talking, and playing games, require no special skills beyond basic communication. For others, such as driving or operating machinery, simple motor skills are required to operate safely. Other areas of daily functioning, such as cooking and using computers, involve learning skills which develop over time to become more complex. These abilities include making choices, remembering things, understanding instructions, speaking clearly, and following rules. To help prevent accidents, make sure that your employer has trained you appropriately in the proper use of equipment and in safety procedures.

Q: How much time must I spend doing my day's usual routine activities every day?\nAnswer: Most daily tasks take only 10 minutes or less to complete. Your work schedule and lifestyle factors may affect the amount of time you actually spend performing your normal activities, but you cannot significantly exceed those limits (see question #3 above).

Q: Should I wear a special type of protective clothing or eye protection during daytime work?\nAnswer: No, as long as you are protected from direct sunlight and are adequately covered by your overall garment, you should not be concerned.

gpt2-xl_77,"There is a relationship between the two, but only if you are taking anti-rejection drugs.

Q: Can I get MS from having sex with someone who has MS? \nAnswer: No. Multiple sclerosis is caused by an immune response that targets and destroys myelin, a protective sheath around nerve cells in the brain, spinal cord and limbs (myelination). In other words, it's not the body attacking your nervous system. Having sexual intercourse doesn't affect any of these processes at all.

Q: Is there a connection between MS and high blood pressure? \nAnswer: Yes. When myelin damage occurs, the immune system attacks the fluid surrounding myelin. This results in abnormal pressure within the bloodstream, which can lead to hypertension (high blood pressure), stroke or heart attack. And just like with MS, this kind of inflammation will occur even when no one is trying to hurt anyone else!

Q: What causes MS? \nAnswer: At birth, there are three types of cells found throughout our bodies. These cell types have their own genes. Over time, as we age, the number of these cell types decreases (a process called ""neurodegeneration""). The cause of most chronic diseases such as MS is unknown, but scientists believe it may be because some of our inherited gene variants alter the body's immune response to certain substances. For example, one genetic variant may make your immune system less sensitive to bacteria or viruses. By being exposed to more pathogens over longer periods of time, the body becomes unable to clear out the invaders and begins to accumulate them. A second genetic variation may contribute to the formation of scar tissue. With age, this scar tissue begins to harden and blocks nerves in the peripheral nervous system (the part of the brain and spinal cord that controls movement, sensation and emotions). In addition to causing pain, numbness, tingling sensations, fatigue and mental confusion, MS also affects vision, hearing, coordination, balance, speech and swallowing. Most people with MS experience problems with walking, climbing stairs or getting into cars. About 5% of MS patients suffer permanent disability after diagnosis.

Q: Why does MS progress so quickly?\nAnswer: Because MS is often misdiagnosed, the disease progresses slowly, which makes diagnosis more difficult. Even though the disease progresses rapidly, early diagnosis and treatment may improve overall mobility. If left untreated, however, the condition can worsen until full recovery takes place. The good news is that MS can be",77,How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?,-3.090043544769287,7,question,10,0.028925619834710745,402,12

gpt2-xl_62,"Many people are surprised and shocked when they discover you have MS. I am not surprised because I had many conversations with my coworkers who were also surprised to learn about the disease. It is very common that people don't know or understand about this.

I've heard from more than one person, ""Oh wow! So you're a doctor now?"" A few were skeptical but others thought it was interesting and wanted to find out more information. The good news is most people did not seem to be too concerned for their own safety. Some took it as an opportunity to connect on a deeper level and to share personal stories of personal struggles that contributed to MS. Others shared similar concerns regarding workplace wellness programs. However, there was some concern over employers providing benefits based on MS diagnoses rather than other conditions. One employer asked me if I would want to consider taking time off or being let go from my job due to MS. While I do understand the need to provide workers health care coverage, those types of policies typically exclude any type of pre-existing condition.

What's next for you after receiving your Master of Science in Epidemiology degree? My PhD research interests lie in identifying risk factors associated with MS, including lifestyle behaviors, environmental exposures (such as air pollution), genetics, and genetic variation. This has implications for public health policy efforts such as regulating smoking cessation programs, which can affect the likelihood of developing MS, as well as controlling population growth.

gpt2-xl_35,"Yes, it can help you achieve and maintain blood glucose control. You should avoid high-glycemic foods (such as white bread or sugar) while following a low-carbohydrate/low-fat diet in order to decrease the risk of developing ketosis (the state in which your body breaks down fat).

Ketones are produced by your liver when carbohydrates become unavailable due to increased insulin resistance and/or inadequate amounts being consumed via diet. This is why ketones may be a useful marker of energy deficiency and/or insulin resistance in the presence of type 1 diabetes. While these biomarkers were originally discovered to help diagnose diabetic ketoacidosis, they are now equally useful in predicting glucose levels after an oral glucose tolerance test.

The bottom line:

If you have diabetes but don't know whether you have hyperglycemia, then a low carb / no carb diet seems like the best option. If you do have diabetes, however, I would recommend that you go on a strict ketogenic diet in order to lower glucose output and thus prevent ketoacidosis from occurring.

In addition to lowering overall glycaemic and insulin levels, this dietary approach also has the added benefit of helping you drop weight through a reduction in appetite and food cravings. In contrast, an unhealthy low calorie diet usually leads to increased calories eaten per day over time, leading to weight gain. By limiting carbohydrate intake, you will likely feel better, even if you don't lose weight.

What about losing weight? How does a ketogenic diet affect my metabolism?

A low carb / no carb diet won't cause rapid weight loss because it doesn't reduce insulin secretion. However, it will dramatically improve metabolic health by reducing the production of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby preventing oxidative damage associated with obesity. Also, since ketones are generated during exercise and not stored as fat, they actually contribute to a reduction in total caloric expenditure.

So what's the catch?

It's important to understand that there are two major caveats to using a ketogenic diet for weight loss. First, the optimal amount of fat needed to get into ketosis depends upon your genetic makeup and body composition. Second, maintaining sufficient physical activity to support brain function during the fasting phase could lead to a slight increase in metabolic rate during ketosis compared to eating normally. It therefore isn't recommended for obese individuals, as long as any significant improvements in metabolic health are maintained throughout the fasted period.",35,Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?,-0.046594712883234,2,question,10,0.012903225806451613,404,26

A good alternative would be a large quantity of fruits and veggies before lunch and dinner. Try to include lots of fibre as well as low calorie snacks throughout the day (eg. nuts, seeds etc).

A5) After playing football all through high school, I was injured while playing lacrosse at Texas Tech University. It took me another 2-1/2 years to recover from this injury. Finally, after going on hiatus from college sports, I found out about CrossFit by chance one day while browsing Reddit and Bodybuilding.com. At first I wasn't sure whether or not I should try it. However, I decided to give it a shot, even though it had only just come into existence 3 years earlier. In early 2011, I joined our team at the beginning of the year. For the first few months, I didn't think I'd be able to stay motivated; however, after meeting a lot of people, it became very apparent that this type of training worked for them as well. Since then, I've continued to keep up with this program every week and have improved tremendously with each workout. Currently, I am attending a state level weightlifting competition scheduled in late April, which will likely be the last contest that I compete in before retirement (I plan on competing in power lifting as well).

What you're looking for is a very mild-to-moderate papulopustular rash with an underlying cause of skin inflammation (not necessarily an infection). Psoriasis is caused by a number of different bacteria and fungi as well as viruses. In many cases, only one or two of these causes are present at any given time. This means there's never a single cause of psoriasis, but rather several factors acting together. The most common are:

Acne - this is the ""root"" cause of psoriasis, the primary lesion that can occur anywhere along your face. Acne affects up to 40% of adults who have acne, and it is usually not controlled by topical medications. It also often worsens over time, leading some people to believe they just need to use an anti-acne product every day. Acne is also the main reason why people experience severe itching and scaling, which is what we see on our scalp. Antibiotics are frequently prescribed to treat acne, so if there's a bacterial infection underneath your skin's surface, you'll probably feel better after taking antibiotics.

Question: I read on this site that your products contain a chemical called titanium dioxide or TiO2? Answer: yes, our products contain both titanium dioxide and titanium oxide. We would love to share more information about them as we've received many inquiries regarding these two ingredients recently. Our products do contain titanium dioxide, however, it's a natural product from the earth, so there shouldn't be any concern with it being present in cosmetic products. There are a few factors to take into account though that might make some consumers uneasy - titanium dioxide does have its benefits when used properly; it helps prevent skin aging while also brightening skin tones. Titanium dioxide has been proven safe for use in makeup applications as well, but what you may be less familiar with is titanium oxide, which is known as an oxidizing agent and can cause redness under certain circumstances. This will occur most often around the eyes. If you experience redness at the eye area due to using a sunscreen, try applying an additional layer of sunscreen overtop of your original one before trying out a new formula.

A little bit of research goes a long way, as well. You should always ask questions first. For example, if you don't know if the company uses chemicals like parabens (they don't), then you should definitely be asking. It doesn't hurt to check with your local or state health department as well.

Causes:

There are a variety of conditions that can cause this complication. If you have been pregnant for more than 5 years or are prone to pre-eclampsia, the risk is higher. The condition is known as gestational hypertension. This occurs when your blood pressure rises during pregnancy. As a result, your placenta grows too tightly and can tear. It is usually not serious, but it may interfere with a baby's ability to get enough oxygen. Also, if there are many red blood cells floating around in your urine, your baby will be exposed to increased amounts of iron, which could increase anemia. A ruptured uterus can also occur when a woman has a miscarriage or gets an ectopic pregnancy (when a fertilized egg implants outside the womb). An ectopic pregnancy might grow into a fallopian tube and block off the passage between the ovaries and uterus. If left untreated, the pregnancy could end in abortion or stillbirth (death after delivery from lack of oxygen). Another complication that can happen during pregnancy includes high blood sugar levels. High blood sugar means your liver isn't able to produce much insulin and sugar, so your body needs extra glucose to burn calories. Without adequate nutrients, your blood sugar can rapidly rise and cause your baby to develop hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).

Diagnosis and treatment:

Your doctor can diagnose pre-eclampsia by conducting a physical exam. Your doctor will ask about symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, and shortness of breath. They'll also look at your height, weight, family history, medications, and any other factors that might raise a concern. Blood tests, ultrasound scans, and fetal ultrasounds will help identify the problem and make sure there aren't any underlying health issues. In severe cases, you might need to undergo surgery. A blood test called a beta-HCG test helps confirm the diagnosis. Beta-HCG stands for betaglucose-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and its purpose is to analyze a type of protein produced in your pancreas. Since pregnancy causes your pancreas to produce a lot of this enzyme, an abnormal reading indicates pre-eclampsia. You're given a shot of beta-HCG along with medication to lower your blood sugar. Depending on what stage of labor you go through, your doctor may recommend further testing, like ultrasound examinations, to determine how soon you should deliver",98,most common complications in pregnancy,-0.3174303472042084,10,question,10,0.056179775280898875,388,9

gpt2-xl_63,"Yes, MS can impact your ability to work. Because of the nature of the disease and its severity, it may also limit your employment opportunities. However, you should not lose confidence in your abilities because of this. For many people with MS, their symptoms are so debilitating that they cannot perform at any level. Even if your job requires very little activity on a daily basis (such as cleaning), it is important for you to maintain an active lifestyle through exercise, sports, or hobbies.

Q: Do I have to be married before having children?A: No, there is no minimum age requirement for marriage. Many couples who get pregnant by accident during their first pregnancy can be helped along by using fertility treatments. If you want to become pregnant yourself, consider finding out if your health insurance will cover prenatal care. It would be wise to consult with your doctor prior to deciding whether to try to conceive naturally, since some people find that natural methods of conception take much longer than trying to induce ovulation via artificial means (like fertility drugs).

Q: Can I use birth control pills when taking my medication?A: You need to make sure that the pill does not interfere with your treatment. If it does, talk to your doctor about changing the regimen to avoid pregnancy while taking your medications. A number of brands of oral contraceptive pills contain estrogen. Using these types of pills is often associated with more severe side effects such as breast tenderness, weight gain, mood swings, acne, irregular periods, and depression. Some women feel better after switching to less potent forms of estrogen. These less potent formulations include progestin-only pills like Ella, Cyproterone acetate, and Mirena®. In addition to making sure that your pill doesn't interfere with your medicine, do not forget to check with your doctor periodically to ensure that the pill is still being taken correctly and that you're maintaining a healthy body weight.

Q: Can I eat raw foods without getting sick?A: Raw food diets are considered dangerous by the FDA. Raw nuts, grains, fruits, vegetables, fish, meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products should only be eaten as part of a balanced diet.

E: 30 years

F: 40 years

G: 50+ years

H: Never answered Answer: E = never; H = never lived together; F = divorced/divorced

Note that the answers to questions 11 and 12 are always positive for these respondents. This is because the participants are asked whether the length of their marriages has been longer than ten years, which corresponds well with the average lifespan in the United States (about fifty-eight years). The length of marriage was also measured at two points during the respondents' lives (one point when the respondent first got married, and another point when he or she moved out of the marital home), which gives us some information on the duration of their previous relationships. In contrast, the responses on question 13 indicate that the respondents knew each other for only five years prior to this interview. Thereby we can assume that the respondents may have been involved in many different kinds of relationships prior to marrying. As a result of this, we cannot be certain that these respondents really had been dating since high school, since the frequency of such dating events was unknown.

It causes weakness in muscles, vision problems, trouble speaking or walking, loss of balance, and pain. The most common signs are headache, difficulty swallowing, numbness around your neck, arm and/or leg, fatigue, tingling sensations on the skin, muscle spasms (spasticity), stiffness, and shortness of breath. In people with MS, these symptoms may start before any other symptoms show up.


This disease may cause you to have seizures, which can be life-threatening. If you do experience an episode of seizure, get medical help right away because it could turn into another attack called a full-blown seizure (also known as a grand mal).

Q: Can my child get MS if they had it when they were younger?


A: Yes. But if their body didn't develop enough antibodies against the autoimmune diseases, then they're unlikely to get them again, according to Dr. Michael Nader, professor of pediatrics at the University of Chicago Medicine. Some research suggests there's no ""cure"" for a genetic form of MS. However, if you did have it as a child, there are treatments available now that may help prevent future episodes of symptoms. See our article: MS Drugs May Help Prevent Seizures, by Dr. Michael Nader, for more information.

Q: Why should I take blood tests when diagnosing MS?


A: All doctors who treat patients with MS are familiar with the fact that many children are misdiagnosed. This happens when a doctor thinks he or she has one thing and discovers later that the patient really has another condition. Sometimes, there is no way to know for sure whether a person has MS until years after they've been diagnosed—and some young people don't even realize they have it. It's important to check both sides of a patient's family history, including possible risk factors such as maternal smoking during pregnancy, having several siblings with the same MS type, and siblings with or without MS. Also, consider taking the test early so that you'll know what results to expect.

This approach includes a complete medical history and physical examination, evaluation of the patient's response to treatment including disease processes (including organ function), treatment options, and the use of complementary and alternative therapies (CATs) that are not currently recommended by current guidelines or government regulations. The integrated approach should be conducted as part of a comprehensive chronic illness management plan with a focus on improving health behaviors, managing stressors, maintaining fitness levels, and optimizing quality of life and overall well being.

In addition, a complete understanding of all aspects of your condition, including both acute symptoms and their underlying causes, must be achieved. There may be times when there is no one specific cause for a particular problem, such as gastrointestinal or cardiovascular problems. In these cases, the physician will consider all possibilities including those which might indicate a diagnosis of digestive disorders, or cancer, or infectious diseases. It should also be noted that some illnesses can appear at any age; therefore, if you have been experiencing fatigue since age 20, it is important that you have your condition evaluated by a healthcare professional who can make recommendations about appropriate treatments. Also, the more severe your illness, the more urgent it is that you seek immediate medical attention. A primary care provider or doctor who is experienced in diagnosing and treating chronic illnesses, however, should not be expected to provide you with an explanation regarding why this illness exists. However, they do need to have an accurate assessment of your overall health status and a thorough understanding of how the various body systems work together to support the normal functioning of each organ system.

What is holistic medicine and what does it NOT include?

It should be noted that many people confuse ""holistic"" with ""alternative."" Holistic means that the practitioner examines the entire person, from head to toe. If, for example, a chiropractor places his hand on your back while he puts pressure on your neck muscles, is the chiropractor showing you the full picture? Of course not! He only has his hands touching parts of your anatomy, but not the rest of your body. Similarly, if a naturopathic physician, for example, was to place needles through your skin into your spine, would he be teaching you the true nature of the human body? Not necessarily! Naturopathy teaches that the human body functions like a computer, or that a cure-all drug has been found for every ailment.

Q: What does a person with BPD look like?

A: People with Borderline Personality Disorder often have significant mood swings in their personalities (often referred to as emotional dysregulation), which can include extreme highs and lows, irritability, anger, impulsivity, self-destructive behavior, and even suicidal tendencies. These people may display two or more different emotions simultaneously at any given time, with no apparent reason why.

Q: How does one know if someone has BPD?

A: There is not an objective physical test for BPD. However, there are other tests that can be used to determine whether someone is experiencing symptoms of BPD. For example, by interviewing family members who regularly interact with the person with BPD, the therapist could determine how much the individual has changed over the course of years. If the symptoms continue to change, then this would indicate that BPD must be present.

Q: Is it possible to treat borderline personality disorder?

A: Unfortunately, the only treatment available for BPD is medication. That said, there are some medications that can help manage symptoms, although these drugs also carry side effects. Also, therapy remains the most effective way of treating BPD.

The bottom line is that once you recognize that BPD exists, you need to get help! You will also find that your diagnosis doesn't mean you're doomed to live alone forever—many people manage to work through life's challenges without BPD.

What is Bipolar Disorder?

Borderline Personality Disorder is just one of many different disorders called ""bipolar"" or ""manic depressive illness."" Bipolar I disorders such as bipolar II (Bipolar II) typically occur when there are both high levels of energy and low amounts of energy in the same day. As a result, people experience a roller coaster ride of feelings and highs and lows.

People with Bipolar II disorder may experience mood swings from extremely positive (e.g., elated) days to depressed or sad ones. In addition, Bipolar II may cause anxiety attacks or panic attacks when manic episodes hit. At its worst, Bipolar II causes severe depression that can last months or longer.

Q: My son has multiple sclerosis, but I don't think he should have his own insurance coverage. How do I explain this to my insurance company?

I've just completed my residency program and am in need of health care in order to take up another job as a primary care provider (PCP) with the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services. What kind of medical benefits can I get from Medicare? Answer: Medicare does cover many services, including most PCPs. However, it is important to note that there are strict limits on the scope of services covered by Medicare. These caps vary depending upon whether or not an individual is eligible for Medicaid. In addition, some PCPs may require additional funding through private insurance plans such as Medigap (also known as managed care), though there are several organizations who provide these services free of charge to patients with MS.

Can I use a third-party payer during my residency? Answer: While many insurance companies will cover your expenses for a full year while you're still working at home, others may require you to submit proof of your income before covering any out-of-pocket expenses, and many third parties only cover a portion of what Medicare covers. As a rule of thumb, the more cash you make, the less likely you are to receive coverage. Also, remember that certain medications must either be bought through the government or purchased from a private insurer, so please contact us for assistance if you have questions about purchasing prescription drugs or other health services.

Is there a special way to tell when my symptoms improve? Answer: Yes. Symptoms of improvement begin to appear soon after starting treatment. In fact, symptoms may be evident as early as 10 days following diagnosis. Most often, however, improvement takes place within 3 months of the initial diagnosis. Symptoms may also start sooner if you experience fatigue, pain, mental confusion, loss of muscle control, or cognitive problems.

What Is Multiple Sclerosis (MS)?\u00a0The most common form of MS is called relapsing-remitting or progressive MS (RRMS). It affects 2% to 5% of people over age 50 who have had an MS diagnosis, but it can strike at any age. The two main types are primary progressive and secondary progressive. Most people with RRMS develop it between ages 20 and 40; some experience it earlier, while others later. Most people with RRMS have more severe disability than those without it. A person with RRMS has about 1/4 to 1/2 of his brain devoted to motor functions such as walking, swallowing, talking, dressing, breathing, and moving around. This is usually not enough for independent life. However, there's always a chance that it will improve if the disease is controlled and the body's immune system is restored to normal. Some people do very well after surgery, radiation therapy, immunotherapy treatments, or drugs designed to treat MS. However, many people don't respond to these treatments, or don't get better at all. For some people, however, MS relapse occurs within months rather than years. These individuals often take time to learn to live independently again. Although some people think they've been diagnosed with MS, they're actually dealing with another disease called neurodegenerative disorders, which involve changes in how the nerve cells communicate with one another. Sometimes, these diseases cause problems that affect the nervous system throughout the body, including spinal cord damage and brain shrinkage.

As people are made more and more accustomed to having a specific medication administered by physicians, their expectations will change.

The Risks of Being Overweight and Obese in Australia

People with obesity are more likely to develop conditions like heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain cancers than people who aren't obese. This means that being overweight and/or obese puts you at higher risk of these diseases than if you were normal weight. So, it's important to be aware of how many kilos (kg) you're carrying around, so you can take steps to lose weight if necessary. There are also some health risks associated with overfatness such as sleep apnea and osteoarthritis of the knees, hip and spine. Read on to find out what to do about these health issues and how much extra care you need when exercising.


How Do I Know If I'm Overweight?

If you weigh yourself regularly, you'll notice that your body mass index (BMI), which measures the amount of fat (in kilograms per metre squared) on your body compared to height (metres tall), will vary from time to time. Your BMI may range between 25 and 30; however, most women who have an excess amount of belly fat (the 'belly' or abdominal area) will have a BMI greater than 30. Women who carry extra pounds around their waist may also have a BMI lower than 25 because they might have some muscle on their upper arms and legs, which gives them a slightly wider waistline but less of a bulge around the middle (abdomen). Having a healthy BMI makes your body feel better, reduces the chance of developing cancer, helps control blood pressure, cholesterol and triglycerides, improves blood flow throughout the body, keeps you feeling full longer, reduces the risk of falls and strokes, protects against cardiovascular disease and can even help reduce the chances of getting Type 2 diabetes.


What Are Some Signs That I Could Be Overweight?

Being overweight or obese increases your risk of developing many of the same conditions as those already linked to being underweight – including:

Heart disease: The higher your BMI, the greater your risk of having heart disease. It's estimated that one third of all deaths among Australians in 2011 related to heart disease. And although researchers don't yet know exactly why this is the case, research suggests a number of factors, including increased levels of saturated fat in our diet",22,my risk for developing type 2 diabetes,-2.0466201305389404,78,question,10,0.312,417,18
gpt2-xl_68,"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects all parts of the body. The main symptom associated with MS are numbness, tingling and/or burning sensations on one or both sides of your face, hands, arms or legs.

The severity of MS is affected by the number of myelin sheath lesions in the brain. The more lesions there are, the worse the disease becomes. It can be quite common for people who have MS to notice their problems as being caused by something else - not a primary condition. This means that it's possible to experience some symptoms without knowing which specific MS-related disease is responsible for them. Some symptoms may also arise while you're taking medicines that affect the immune system, such as corticosteroids. Your GP will do tests to check if any of these conditions are causing you symptoms. If they are, you'll need to take extra steps so you don't feel unwell again when your medication is stopped. For instance, you could try taking vitamin supplements. You should also talk to your doctor about how to reduce the risk of getting side effects from prescribed medicine, including those connected with MS. Common MS symptoms include: dizziness, balance problems, poor memory, loss of balance or coordination, nausea, headaches, fatigue, muscle pain, weakness and joint pain.

What causes myeloid leukaemia? Myeloid leukaemia can cause symptoms such as fever, tiredness, weight loss, stomach aches and diarrhoea. These usually last at least a week but may persist for up to 3 months. A person with this type of cancer has an abnormal build up of white blood cells called T cells and B cells. These two types of cells help fight infections, such as flu. When T cells and B cells accumulate abnormally in the bone marrow, they can form tumours that spread throughout the body and damage normal organs, such as the liver, kidneys and thymus gland. As well as leukaemias, other types of cancer that involve the bone marrow include lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALS). People with both forms of these cancers can develop symptoms similar to those seen with MS.

gpt2-xl_57,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive disease of the nervous system that causes destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, resulting in weakness, numbness or paralysis.

The disease is considered to be one of multiple sclerosis's many manifestations because it affects different parts of the body; each stage represents an area where MS patients are experiencing symptoms.

In MS, the immune system attacks myelin sheath around nerves fibers, which results in sensory loss, fatigue, pain, difficulty with speech, vision problems, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and cognitive dysfunction.

Multiple sclerosis may also result from a problem with blood vessels and tissue within the brain. The condition can cause significant disability, though only about 1 out of every 4 people who have MS will develop clinical signs of the disease.

It's estimated that nearly 1 million Americans, or 11% of all adults, have MS. It most commonly affects women between 40 and 55 years old. Most cases occur in those ages 25-44, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

Other conditions that share characteristics with MS include chronic kidney disease, epilepsy, Crohn's Disease, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.

gpt2-xl_93,"Although there is no clear evidence for a connection between MS and sleep, it is believed that the two conditions are related. MS patients frequently report difficulties in falling asleep or staying asleep (insomnia) and have difficulty remembering important events from their past.


MS may also cause memory loss. However, this can be prevented by taking medications called an anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen which block inflammation in the brain. This means that MS patients should not feel sleepy during the day and instead they will be more alert and focused during their days. Additionally, there is some evidence to suggest that regular exercise helps alleviate insomnia in MS patients. Therefore, avoiding stress may help reduce anxiety and keep MS patients from feeling tired at night.


Another reason why MS patients experience these symptoms is because of a lack of sleep itself. Some researchers believe that this may occur due to an imbalance in the body's natural clock system known as the circadian rhythm. The body produces melatonin when it receives certain cues from the sun. As this process begins around midnight, it becomes increasingly difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep until morning.


Researchers believe that many MS patients who do not have insomnia are having trouble falling asleep, but are unaware that they are not getting enough sleep. A recent study suggests that those with MS who sleep less than six hours per night are twice as likely to develop an autoimmune disorder. Many studies show that being more physically active improves sleeping patterns in people with MS. In addition, physical activity improves mood, reduces pain, and stimulates your immune system.


Therefore, being more physically active will reduce depression and improve sleep patterns while reducing fatigue. Being in control of your lifestyle and exercising regularly has been found to lower your risk for developing MS. It is best to make sure you eat well and drink plenty of water. Try to avoid alcohol. Alcohol consumption causes hyperactivity and affects your metabolism which decreases the effectiveness of melatonin making you unable to sleep naturally.",93,Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?,-0.0094307409599423,0,question,10,0.0,345,26

Although it is possible for a person with an inherited form of MS (usually referred to as ""genetic"") to have MS later on, this has not been documented in clinical studies. Other risks include birth defects due to genetic mutations or environmental agents such as chemicals during pregnancy, or exposure to toxins from smoking or asbestos during childhood or adolescence. It is also possible to develop MS after receiving certain drugs that affect the immune system, particularly when used by people who do not have adequate levels of T cells. Finally, some women may become pregnant while taking immunosuppressant drugs. In rare cases, these drugs can cause birth defects.

Q: Why should I get vaccinated before getting my MMR shot?

A: Most children will receive their first dose of MMR vaccine prior to going through puberty. Some pediatricians recommend delaying the second dose until the child's 9th birthday, but others think that delaying both doses provides sufficient time to build up immunity. Many vaccines are given to young children between 3 months and 2 years of age. These vaccines include diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine (PCV7), Hepatitis A vaccine (Pneumovax H1N1), meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MenACWY), pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PSV4), rotavirus vaccine, rabies vaccine, varicella vaccine, chicken pox virus vaccine, pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine and yellow fever vaccine. Children should be routinely monitored for any signs or symptoms of disease caused by these vaccines and for the development of allergies to them or to egg proteins contained in the vaccines themselves. In addition, there is concern about acquiring vaccine-induced encephalopathy (vaccine-associated encephalomyelitis/encephalopathy). This occurs when an otherwise healthy individual develops neurological problems related to the brain inflammation caused by vaccination. An estimated 30% of cases involve infants and younger children and up to 40% of those affected die within 3 weeks after being diagnosed. Most individuals with vaccine-induced encephalopathy recover completely without long-term disability, and most deaths occur in the 1st year after diagnosis.

Self-reported intakes were adjusted using the diet-history method, which includes a weighting factor that adjusts for food preparation and eating behaviors.13 The distribution of energy intake among participants was similar across strata defined by educational level (<High school graduate; High school graduate; some college graduate; college graduate); sex; race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, Mexican American; Hispanic, non-Hispanic black; African American); and BMI (<25 kg/m2; 25–29.9 kg/m2; 30–34.9 kg/m2; 35–39.9 kg/m2; ≥40 kg/m2); however, individuals with a higher BMI had an elevated risk of death compared to those with lower BMIs.14 For each individual in our cohort, we calculated the percentage of calories consumed from fat (excluding saturated fatty acids and trans fats), protein, carbohydrate, and fiber intake using nutrient database information available through the National Cancer Institute's National Center for Health Statistics' Web-based Epidemiologic Information System for Diet Study Data.15

Statistical Analysis

We estimated the association between total energy intake and all-cause mortality in our cohort using Cox proportional hazards regression models.16 First, we determined the incidence rate ratio (IRR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) with 95% CIs (for men) and 100% CIs (for women) comparing the highest versus lowest quintile of total energy intake. Next, we stratified analyses by baseline physical activity by using the results from a validated health examination survey in 1997 (the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) that examined leisure time physical activities, which include walking and swimming as well as active transportation (",116,outcome prostate cancer,-11.437350273132324,209,question,10,0.842741935483871,349,6

Q. Is it true that eating eggs can prevent cancer? Answer: This is not a well-known fact. But there are some people who are worried about their cholesterol levels, so they might try egg yolks as a way to lower those numbers. However, other studies suggest that egg consumption does not actually reduce cardiovascular disease risk in healthy individuals.

Q. Do you know how many grams of fat in an egg or how long it would take to digest it if you ate one? Answer: We do not know what this food contains because these data are based on commercial recipes. It's probably around 1/2 gram of fat per serving.

gpt2-xl_130,"Back stretches are an excellent stretch for the shoulders, but I do not include them in my exercises because of a very important reason.

The muscles of your back should be relaxed before you begin to work on your wrists. The purpose is to develop your forearm strength through passive tension. This will increase with time if you use proper form. It takes only about 10 seconds per muscle to strengthen it. You can also add more movements into this section. If you feel a problem or have any questions, ask me! Also, remember that working on your wrist flexibility will help you perform better at all other parts of your game.

Q: Shoulder blades (shoulder blades) stretching

A: A great way to improve your shoulders is to practice these shoulder blade stretches by yourself before practicing against others. Remember to start from the same position as when doing the exercises, and just relax when going over the top of each movement. Use a foam roller for this exercise. It's simple, and it makes a huge difference. Practice these shoulder blades stretches for 5-10 minutes a day.

1. Place a towel under the edge of a table so you're able to rest your arm on the back side.

2. Take your hands off the edge of the table and place them behind your head (not behind your ears).

3. Squeeze your bicep, pull the skin between your shoulder blades toward your spine and pull the skin back, while contracting your quadriceps. Repeat 2 times.

4. Stretch your left shoulder blade towards the ceiling, keeping your elbows bent.

5. Spread your right arm out wide, then gently squeeze your triceps, pulling the skin away from your back. Keep your elbow in contact with the floor. Make sure to keep the fingers together and don't bend the elbow. Hold for 30-60 seconds.

6. Rotate both arms so they face forward.

7. Repeat 6 steps again. Try to complete 3 sets of 15 repetitions.


It doesn't matter how long you hold the previous exercises for. They'll become easier after some days. When you go to train, try to start with your arms extended straight ahead, and slowly contract your biceps to make them bigger and stronger. Be patient and don't rush to reach your goal immediately.

This study found that patients who received two cycles of high dose temozolomide plus gemcitabine were more likely to respond than those treated only with gemcitabine. The response rate was 76 percent versus 44 percent among patients receiving one cycle of treatment.

The authors say this may be due to the ""significantly higher doses of temozolomide."" For example, temozolomide can cause systemic hypotension, which could lead to reduced survival. In addition, the researchers note that while it has been shown that gemcitabine alone does not improve overall survival compared with the combination of temozolomide and gemcitabine, the two therapies do appear to be effective when used together.

In another large randomized trial comparing two different combinations of temozolomide and gemcitabine (no chemotherapy), patients receiving both temozolomide and gemcitabine had a significantly better survival rate (95 percent CI [95% CI] 1.19 to 1.34 vs 93.5 percent CI [93.7-94.8 percent]) compared to patients treated with one or the other drug alone.",117,stage 4 metastatic lung cancer outcome,-1.3872699737548828,21,question,10,0.0846774193548387,295,14

5.2. The body has a tendency to absorb water from the air in times of extreme stress or extreme cold or heat. This is called evaporation. When this happens, the water leaves your cells through pores that are not normally open. These pores are located between each cell's membrane and its nucleus (the center of the cell). It can take up to two weeks for water molecules to pass through these pore spaces into your bloodstream, so if you have been in an environment where the weather was hot or cold, it can be very hard to breathe because all of the water evaporated before it could get out.

Because there are certain substances that make us more sensitive to changes in our environment, we need constant rest and exercise. We also need to drink water at least twice daily in order to keep ourselves hydrated and maintain proper blood sugar levels and electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and calcium. If we go without water, the kidneys will start to conserve it by drawing on stored water from other parts of the body. This allows the body to avoid losing water too quickly. But over time, the kidneys lose enough water to eventually cause dehydration (low blood volume) unless you are drinking plenty of fluids.

The body needs a lot of salt during times when you're exercising and your body isn't getting enough rest. Because the kidneys regulate how much salt we consume, people with diabetes who do not drink enough fluid may develop kidney stones, which can lead to serious health problems. Many athletes use sports drinks containing electrolytes to help control their thirst. However, many sports drinks contain artificial sweeteners, which raise the level of insulin in the body, making the person feel hungry. This can interfere with weight loss efforts. You should choose foods that give you energy, but don't increase hunger.

In addition to the above issues involving water, sweating is another common problem among people with type 2 diabetes. Sweating occurs when the skin produces excess amounts of perspiration, especially when you sweat profusely after vigorous activity. In some cases, these excessive feelings of thirst may last for hours. Sometimes, the pain associated with excessive sweating may actually make you thirsty. And sometimes, these symptoms of thirst may be due to a normal response of the nervous system. For example, the brain thinks that you need water or other liquids to prevent dehydration, even though you aren't thirsty. As a result, your body releases the hormone norepinephrine, causing you",101,heavy flares swelling lymph nodes,-13.978074073791504,114,question,10,0.926829268292683,429,0
gpt2-xl_96,"It is best to avoid consuming foods that are high in sugar, fat or saturated fats. When we think about how our bodies digest food we must realize that there is a balance between the three nutrients. The most important nutrient for you as an adult is water. Without water your body cannot survive. Water is needed for brain function, digestion and elimination of waste products from cells such as uric acid, ammonia, glucose and carbon dioxide. All these functions are very important for keeping your organs healthy and functioning properly. It should be noted that some nutrients (such as sodium) are too concentrated to be absorbed through the normal mechanism by the small intestine. Therefore you need to eat a balanced diet. If you have a high blood pressure, you will probably want to reduce your sodium intake. As always it is wise to consult with a physician before making any changes in dietary habits. In order for your body to get rid of excess salt, especially sodium chloride, your kidneys have to process the salt in urine. Sodium citrate is used in many medications and other products. It works well in reducing urinary volume which improves kidney function. So if you do not like the taste of salty foods, try taking sodium citrate and see how it affects your bowel movements.


For people on low cholesterol levels, lowering their cholesterol level can also help lower their blood pressure. Although this type of therapy is only recommended after all other therapeutic efforts have failed and has not been proven effective by clinical trials. The only way to know if there is a connection between your LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and your blood pressure is to undergo a complete medical evaluation including a lipid panel. A simple blood test of the lipids, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and blood pressure is usually done at your doctor's office for $20-$30.

What Are Therapeutic Techniques?: \r

Therapeutic techniques include methods which attempt to address underlying causes of one's distress or emotional disturbance, as well as strategies for changing dysfunctional patterns of thought, behavior and perception. It is important to understand that not all therapeutic techniques can be used to treat everyone equally well; some treatments will produce greater benefits than others. For instance, there might be a need for a different set of approaches if an individual has a tendency towards obsessive-compulsive disorder or even borderline personality disorder. However, those therapists who have experience working with people who suffer from these disorders know that they can often offer much needed insight into the causes of the symptoms and even possible solutions.\r

How Does Therapy Work?: \r

In therapy, both the therapist and the patient engage in a process where each attempts to uncover what causes the individual's problem(s), identify obstacles preventing the solution, and then seek creative or productive means of addressing the condition.\r

This disease causes the body to rely on sugar as its main source of energy; therefore, if you don't control your blood glucose levels by controlling your food and drink intake, you will eventually run out of it.

Is diabetes contagious? It depends on who gets it and how quickly they do, and this usually depends on genetics. If one person has Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes, their children are more likely than other people to have it themselves. However, there isn't any reason that anyone should get the condition unless they are genetically predisposed to getting it. The best prevention would be to monitor your own blood glucose level carefully. You can find out more about how to test yourself on our page on testing your blood glucose level.

If you have a diagnosis of type-1 or type-2 diabetes, you need insulin injections every three hours to keep your blood glucose levels in check. These injections contain insulin (the hormone that regulates the amount of sugar in the bloodstream) and sometimes beta cells from the pancreas that release the medication into your bloodstream.

Q7. What are the different types of contraception and how do they work?

A. Contraceptives prevent pregnancy by preventing ovulation, which means that if you have sex while using a contraceptive method or after having sex with another person during your fertile period, the sperm is unable to fertilize an egg (the one in your uterus) because it has been blocked or impeded from reaching an egg. There are three main kinds of contraceptives: vaginal ring, intrauterine device (IUD), and implant. The IUD is the most effective form of long-term contraception currently available. It works by releasing small amounts of hormones into the uterine wall. Because it releases just enough hormones for it to be effective, these methods are only available as long as you use them regularly. If you don't use them, you may experience side effects such as spotting, pain, heavy bleeding, and cramping. If any of these problems occur, you should talk to your doctor about other options. Some people also choose to get pregnant naturally (without using hormonal methods). For example, many women who want to become mothers take home remedies such as garlic and chamomile tea to make their menstrual cycles less regular. Other strategies include taking extra birth control pills every day for several years so you will avoid missed periods when you're trying to conceive, or taking a drug called gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs (GnRHaAs) to mimic the natural process of ovulation.

Q8. How does contraception affect fertility?

A. Most methods of contraception can cause some degree of infertility. However, depending on the type of contraception used and the woman's health history, contraceptive methods might help increase fertility or even replace some fertility loss. You'll need to see your physician if you'd like more information.

Q9. Can all forms of contraception help reduce risk of STDs?

A. Contraceptive pills (such as Plan B One-Step) may help lower the chance of getting infections caused by bacteria such as Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis, HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis C (HCV) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1). Some birth control pills contain estrogen, which can decrease the chances of getting certain types of cancer, including cervical cancer. Birth control patches, rings, and spermicides (creams) can protect against STIs such as gonorrhea and genital warts.
