gpt2-large_112,"A respiratory disease affecting the airways that can cause shortness of breath or wheezing in people with weakened immune systems. This form of asthma often occurs when an individual is exposed to smoke during outdoor activity. The most commonly reported symptoms include shortness of breath and wheezing. Question: What causes heart attack? Complete Answer: Cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, is the leading cause of death worldwide.\nQuestion: How many people die from lung cancer every year? Complete Answer: Lung cancer is the second leading cause of death among men. It accounts for approximately one out of every three deaths in the United States each year. For women it is the fourth leading cause of death.\nQuestion: Is there any link between smoking and lung cancer? Complete Answer: No, smokers do not experience increased risk for developing lung cancer. Most researchers who have studied this question conclude that the association between cigarette smoking and lung cancer was once thought to be causal. However, recent studies suggest that long-term exposure to secondhand smoke may result in reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.\nQuestion: What causes kidney failure? Complete Answer: Kidney disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. In fact, if you measure the number of deaths associated with kidney disease per person every year, the United States has the highest rate in the industrialized nations. These numbers indicate that nearly 400 million Americans live with some degree of kidney impairment.\nQuestion: Does vitamin D really prevent heart attacks? Complete Answer: Vitamin D does not protect against cardiovascular disease. People who have high blood concentrations of vitamin D should supplement their diet with vitamin D as part of a healthy lifestyle. This includes taking 400 IU (international units) of vitamin D per day. Ask your doctor whether he or she recommends vitamin D supplementation.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION

1. Health care professionals receive frequent requests for information regarding potential links between tobacco use and chronic diseases such as stroke and hypertension. The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of current knowledge on these topics related to smoking cessation and smoking cessation medication.

2. Cigarette smoking is responsible for the majority of the deaths resulting from chronic diseases across all age groups, but it also results in significant morbidity and mortality. Cigarette smoking contributes directly to the development of several cancers, and a variety of other diseases. With the exception of lung cancer, however, cigarette smoking appears to",112,symptoms of asthma,-9.023681640625,119,multimedqa,1,0.5666666666666667,413,23
gpt2-large_109,"This is an inherited disease (genetically related to rheumatoid arthritis) that affects all types of people with either familial or sporadic forms. It affects the autonomic nervous system (which controls many bodily functions), causing increased heart rate and sweating. The most severe symptoms are found in infants, children, teenagers, young adults, menopausal women, elderly individuals, pregnant women, diabetics, smokers, those with high blood pressure, migraineurs, people who take medication for depression, and anyone who eats fast food.

gpt2-large_83,"There have been several studies that show MS is more prevalent than many people think. For example, in one study, a total of 8 million Americans were seen for a diagnosis of MS. The most common type of MS was relapsing; but other types were also reported from patients who did not respond to previous treatments. In addition, some doctors incorrectly diagnose this disease as a chronic form of MS or another autoimmune condition like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A better answer might be that it's simply an overdiagnosis. When you see the number of people with MS increase, many doctors believe that they must have multiple sclerosis and treat them all at once. This leads to unnecessary medication, which can often lead to serious side effects. Instead, get a thorough physical examination and make sure your symptoms don't seem so severe that there's nothing else that could be wrong. If any of these conditions exist, then consider getting a second opinion from someone you trust. Question: I'm a diabetic. How do I know if I have diabetes? Complete Answer: One of the first things to check for when diagnosing MS is whether you're a diabetic. It may sound obvious, but some people just aren't aware that they have diabetes. Diabetes occurs when your blood sugar levels are too high and cannot properly control them. As a result, your pancreas releases insulin to keep your body's blood sugar level stable. Once your blood glucose levels drop below a certain point, you experience what's known as hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can cause your muscles to feel weak, tired, and sluggish. Also, high blood pressure and heart failure sometimes occur. Many people find it difficult to function normally after becoming hypoglycemic. If you have diabetes, however, the best way to test your blood sugar is through a finger prick test. Your doctor will give you a standard needle stick test to ensure that your level is within normal range. You should never try to change your diet or exercise habits while taking insulin, however. Your doctor will tell you how much insulin to take based on your individual situation. But even then, it's important to stay vigilant, especially if you have high cholesterol, high triglycerides, or large amounts of fat around your abdomen. This means you should continue working out, eating healthy foods, and keeping your weight under 50 pounds.",83,Why get episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis?,-0.0999935716390609,9,multimedqa,1,0.038461538461538464,397,39

Complete Answer: A medical debt is an amount owed by you or another individual as compensation for a service rendered. Your medical debts can be incurred when doctors perform services on you that they do not have authority to provide (e.g., hospitalization). You should also be aware of what types of treatment may be covered by insurance coverage.\nQuestion: Do I need to pay back my credit card interest if it was charged more than $50? \nAnswer: Yes, you must pay your balance due each month regardless of whether you receive any payments from the creditor. It is important to remember that some creditors will refuse to honor a payment request from someone who does not pay their bill each month. However, most creditors will still honor a request made directly to them, so it's often better to contact the creditor first before making such a claim. The creditor usually has many different ways of paying off your account. Many cards, including those issued by banks or credit unions, allow you to make payments through direct deposit. If you are having difficulty getting your money out quickly, a personal loan can be a good option. It takes time to repay a student loan, but there are no monthly charges associated with a personal loan. Some loans require you to put up a certain amount every week, and other lenders offer monthly installments on a schedule. You could even find a mortgage company that offers mortgages on the same terms as payday loans. Most people agree that making regular monthly payments is a good thing to do. Keep in mind that your financial situation may change over time. For example, if you moved out of state and lost your job, you might be forced to re-establish yourself financially. Also, some companies charge additional fees and/or require you to pay a percentage of the purchase price of goods or services while under contract. To help manage your financial life, consider seeking assistance from a professional counselor or financial advisor. With time, you will learn the details of your finances and will be able to set realistic goals to achieve success.

MS patients have found jobs in business, medicine, technology or marketing.\nQuestion: What is the difference between an ""MS patient"" and a ""patient""? Complete Answer: An MS patient has one symptom that they are currently experiencing. Patients will sometimes experience other symptoms as well and their condition will change over time. Most people with MS suffer from several different conditions at once which requires more than one diagnosis. The term ""patients"" refers only to those who are not receiving treatment or therapies for their MS, but still want to be treated. While most people with MS do recover and feel better in many ways, some continue to live with chronic pain, cognitive problems and disability. This makes it difficult to find a job where you can make a positive impact on your community and take care of yourself. Students may choose to pursue additional education, such as nursing or law school. To learn more about these options, please read about MS employment opportunities. \nQuestion: How do I get started teaching? Complete Answer: The most effective way to teach your students is to encourage them to think about all areas of study in depth and create a cohesive and supportive learning environment through which your students become knowledgeable learners. At MSA, we provide the tools necessary to help teachers develop effective approaches to class discussion and assignments. We offer courses focused on critical thinking, writing, and problem solving.

Myelin sheath proteins that support myelin cell axons and act as signal transducers for nerve impulses also contribute to both MS and MMS.\nQuestion: What is the difference between male and female reproductive system in humans and what causes the differences in the genders?\nAnswer: Human males and females have distinct internal reproductive organs with separate parts (ovaries, testes). Males produce estrogen from their testes while females produce testosterone. Estrogen has been detected at low levels in serum of both sexes throughout gestation, birth, and early childhood. However, during adolescence and young adulthood, most of the excess estrogen produced by men is eliminated through a process called autocrine estrogens production; this produces similar effects on women and children. For example, if a woman's body begins producing less estrogen than expected because of her age, her ovaries will not release an adequate amount of estrogen to ensure proper development of her eggs. When this happens, fertilization failure may result. This phenomenon, referred to as ""menopausal symptoms"" or ""masculinized symptoms,"" does not affect all individuals equally, although it occurs more frequently in older people.\nQuestion: Why does acne occur among adults when there is no obvious cause?\nAnswer: There appear to be numerous factors that cause acne including genetics, environmental stressors, lifestyle choices, hormones, hormonal imbalances, physical illnesses, and other conditions affecting skin color and appearance. While it is possible that some genetic predisposition to acne could exist, studies show that acne develops in response to a variety of external triggers. In particular, one study found that acne occurred more often in patients who were prescribed antibiotics. In another study, 80 percent of people taking prednisone had mild-to-moderate acne, whereas only 8 percent took oral steroids, which increase production of the immune system's killer T cells. Other studies have shown that higher doses of aspirin decrease the effectiveness of antibiotics against acne. Acne is more likely to develop in persons with certain genes involved in the activity of sebaceous glands and other glands that secrete secretions such as sebum and oils. \nQuestion: Do we know anything about why the human body changes colors after a certain period of time?\nAnswer: It is believed that melanocytes convert white to brownish red in response to light exposure over time.

When it comes down to it, there is a lot of misinformation surrounding fluoridation programs. As we discussed in an earlier article, the CDC has admitted they did not conduct any studies regarding their anti-fluoride campaign before instituting it. Instead, they relied upon ""independent"" scientists who were paid by the pharmaceutical industry. A recent study conducted by the University of Rochester found that there was a strong link between fluoridated drinking water and autism in children born after 1984 - this time when children were less likely to receive these vaccinations.

The Ketogenic Diet is not suitable for all people. It can be extremely difficult to control the amount of carbohydrates you consume on this diet. If you do decide to start a ketogenic diet, it is strongly advised that you consult your doctor before beginning a new diet. In addition, you should keep in mind that many supplements will alter the composition of your diet, so be sure to discuss them with your healthcare professional first! \r


What is Ketosis?\r

Ketosis is the state where body fat stores are reduced to very low levels. Fat cells produce less energy per unit of fuel as opposed to glucose cells which make more energy from glucose. This creates a situation where there is less available oxygen and less available energy. That's why most people experience ketones. However, some people do NOT experience any ketosis and they don't even know it exists. So what causes ketosis?\r

\r

When we eat food that contains carbs, our bodies use the stored carbohydrate as fuel for energy production. When we eat foods that contain fats, our body uses the fats as energy source. When we eat foods that contain proteins, our body uses protein as its main fuel. Therefore, when we eat carbohydrates or fat, we can change the way our bodies burn energy.\r


How do I get my calories back if I am eating carbs and/or fat?\r

As soon as we stop consuming carbs or fats, we start using less energy to carry out these activities. The end result is an increase in hunger which can cause us to eat more than necessary. At times, the desire to eat can also trigger overeating behavior that leads to weight gain.\r


Do I need to reduce or eliminate sugars?\r

Yes. Sugar has been linked to obesity, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and osteoporosis. Even moderate amounts of added sugars can negatively affect moods, sleep patterns, appetite, and overall quality of life. Studies show that adding simple sugars such as honey, agave syrup, cane juice and sucrose to a typical American diet increases the chances of developing Type 2 Diabetes, especially among children.

gpt2-large_131,"You may not have the time or inclination to go through the research yourself, so we recommend you take a look at our resources on this topic. \nQuestion: which foods to eat for weight loss? Complete Answer: The most important factor to consider when looking for food sources of calories is how much you burn from them. While it would be fine if your daily intake were strictly controlled (e.g., you ate one large serving of vegetables every day), there's no reason why it shouldn't be possible to add some additional calories to your diet by consuming other things that provide a similar effect. For example, eating more protein can increase your burning rate significantly, but it will also boost the level of carbohydrates in your diet. \nQuestion: what's the best way to get back an extra 40 lbs.? Complete Answer: Most people simply need to start working out again (or stop) after having lost the amount they used to gain. If you're already healthy and able to train hard enough, then it doesn't really matter whether or not you lose weight as long as you've got enough energy left over to make sure you stay strong and fit. After all, it takes quite a bit of effort just to maintain the body you started with...and then some! \nQuestion: How do I stay fit while being active? Complete Answer: Once your diet becomes more balanced and healthy, you should be able to perform at least some moderate physical activity regularly (i.e., walking to work). As such, keep a running journal where you record the number of miles you run each week, and also record the times you exercise (on foot, bike, etc.). This information can help guide you toward an optimal approach to fitness and health. Your goal should still be to remain physically active at all times; however, it does help to determine the appropriate percentage of your total energy expenditure for both aerobic and resistance training activities. \nQuestion: how far can I go without taking any breaks? Complete Answer: It's easy to feel like you're always getting distracted or stuck doing something else. That's because many of us live in a constant state of motion; constantly moving between activities, routines, and priorities. However, this isn't necessarily harmful, since you can learn to manage your schedule and focus on only certain types of tasks. There are various ways to improve efficiency.

gpt2-large_121,"This is an abnormal pain in the muscles that surround your fingertips. The symptoms of this disorder usually develop as you get older. It can range from slight discomfort to deep irritation and sometimes even permanent damage. You may have numbness on one or both hands and it's very common for people with this condition to find themselves unable to do things like write, hold up books, lift heavy objects, fold clothes, or use a computer keyboard. What causes this? People who suffer from chronic low back pain often experience loss of muscle tone in their lower extremities. In most cases, when these muscles weaken, they tend to become permanently damaged over time.

The culprit is inflammation. When your body doesn't produce enough natural painkillers, the body starts to fight off the infection causing the pain. But too much inflammatory response (which happens naturally) also tends to lead to degeneration of your nerves, which ultimately leads to numbness in those parts of your hand that aren't covered by skin.\nQuestion: I've had a hard time sleeping and I'm getting headaches and sleepiness all the time. Do I need to go see a doctor? Complete Answer: You probably should be seeing a doctor if your insomnia is severe or lasts more than three nights a week. If you're having trouble falling asleep at night without some other form of help, talk to your doctor or therapist immediately. They'll make recommendations for what kind of treatment might help. Some types of medications, such as benzodiazepines, may help some patients and won't affect others. Ask whether any drugs prescribed for high blood pressure are OK for you. Many medications used for sleep problems can cause dangerous side effects such as heart disease, stroke, and cancer, so always consult with your doctor before starting any medication. \nQuestion: My wife has been trying to keep me awake since last night.

The inflammatory cells then become trapped within the follicle which produces large amounts of sebum and other oils known as sebum barrier proteins. These toxins attach themselves to the cell membranes causing swelling of the follicular wall, the cell layer that covers most of the body from the bottom to top. Symptoms include frequent itching and redness of the face, neck, and hands (usually in the upper arm). The irritation caused by the toxic protein build up and subsequent inflammation can also lead to rashes, burning sensations, sores, and inflamed lymph nodes. Although psoriasis is not a contagious disease it does spread quickly through close contact. When psoriasis first appears it usually only affects one person in the family. Once the illness progresses, however, it becomes more common and even widespread across generations. As psoriasis progresses it develops into two distinct disorders; erythema multiforme (EM) and erythematosarcoma (EOS). EM is a chronic disease characterized by persistent, non-specific dermatitis and inflammation of the epidermis and dermis, often involving the palms, soles, buttocks, and underarms (also called ""underarm psoriasis""). EOS is more limited in its manifestation, affecting a small number of people (typically fewer than 10%) with a rash spreading down the back and trunk.

gpt2-large_94,"You should be feeling much better by the end of this year (2016). Your symptoms may not appear until January 2017 or later. A person's response is influenced by many factors. For example, your age, the type of MS, how long you have had it, your medication, lifestyle habits, and environmental factors can all affect how well you respond to treatment.

Answer: This disease is treatable, but a diagnosis requires careful evaluation. The majority of people with MS do very well. Most people with MS recover completely without disability within 4 years after receiving their first dose of a new drug. However, some people don't get better for several months after they begin taking their first course of an older drug. In addition, as in any chronic condition such as diabetes, the best way to determine whether you'll make a full recovery is to monitor your progress, follow your doctor's instructions carefully and use medications that help prevent future relapse. With each successive dose of an anti-inflammatory drug, your risk of developing recurrent relapses increases. Once you've made substantial progress in managing your MS symptoms and have made two consecutive doses of an anti-inflammatory drug, the likelihood that you'll recur becomes less likely.

In summary, the good news is that many people who develop multiple sclerosis experience improvement over time, with few permanent consequences. People who manage their illness effectively also tend to make significant gains in quality of life over time. If you have been diagnosed with MS and you want to understand how effective treatments work, you might benefit from consulting an MS specialist.

Anesthesia or anesthesia is an essential part of the delivery process. There are several types of anesthesia used during childbirth, including midwifery and surgical. Although many women will have an epidural, this may not be possible due to their current position or because of personal reasons. If you're having a vaginal birth, you can choose between either the epidural or the local anesthetic. If you're experiencing discomfort with either option, it's best to try both before making your final decision. The epidural is administered by inserting a tube through which fluid is pumped into the cervix. This technique is known as epidurals. Some doctors use lidocaine, which is injected directly into the muscle walls and helps relax the muscles involved. Local anesthetics are often applied intravenously to help control pain during labor and delivery. When choosing an epidural, ask whether there will be any risks for you and your baby. Do you need to wait at least 24 hours after injection? How long should I hold my breath if my blood pressure gets too high while the epidural is being inserted? Can we monitor your heart rate while using the epidural? What if I'm allergic to the medication? Are there any side effects? Question: how do I know when the epidural has been put in correctly? Complete Answer: You'll want to listen carefully to what the doctor says before trying to insert the epidural. While some women prefer to simply push down on the back of the table until they feel no pain, others find that if they place their hands near the base of the table, then lean forward a little bit, they can feel the needle coming out easily. Another tip is to press gently against your abdomen before putting your feet on the table to make sure the needles don't slide away from the skin. Ask yourself a few simple questions to determine if your body is ready to receive this treatment: Is the epidural comfortable? Does the insertion feel right? Will this procedure take more than a minute? If so, ask the doctor or nurse to start slowly with the insertion process. A gentle tingling sensation could indicate that your body feels ready to receive the epidural injection. Are you able to move the seat up or down as needed? Does it hurt? If so, don't hesitate to stop the epidural, but don't rush into giving birth if the procedure takes longer than expected. In some cases, the epidural can last up to two hours.

The disease may be associated with an increase in mortality but not with increased risk of early deaths. (2) MS patients who develop a new clinical presentation of the disease during their lifetime are more likely than other individuals to have at least one serious illness later on in life. Therefore, the majority of people diagnosed with MS will remain healthy throughout their lifetimes. (3) There is no clear evidence that there are any long term side effects from MS treatment. Most people with MS experience few if any complications after having had their MS treatment. Some people say they feel better immediately after stopping all treatments except for a couple of weeks of anti-inflammatory medication which is very rarely necessary. However, this does not mean that it's a good idea to stop MS treatment. It may take months or years before you can fully recover from your MS treatment. Other problems such as low bone density and joint pain should also be considered when deciding whether to continue with therapy.\nQuestion: what is the current cost for treating MS? Complete Answer: The cost varies widely depending on how many hours are required for each appointment, how much time you spend with the doctor, and how much money you pay. For example, most insurance companies will cover some of the initial costs of an appointment to treat MS. If you don't have insurance, you'll have to find out which insurance company covers you, how much you'll need to pay, and what coverage there is. Be aware that it could take several months to determine your payment amount. You should ask the doctor for an estimate. Ask for an estimated total annual cost as well; this includes both expenses incurred while waiting to see a doctor and payments made by the insurer as part of a policy. Make sure you check your insurance plan prior to going to the doctor to make sure the deductibles and co-payments are covered too.

Most people with a history of mental illnesses know at some point in their lives that something is wrong. However, many people don't realize until it becomes too much of a problem that it may just be normal and healthy behavior changes that occur over time.

Someone who used to work in an occupation where she could get paid often feels less motivated now that she works in a lower paying job. People do this all the time. The following questions might prompt you to think about how these normal behaviors could affect your loved one and determine whether something is seriously wrong:

Do you see any change in your loved one's behavior? Is your loved one taking a different approach to work, school, recreation, social activities, family life, etc.? Do you notice a difference in his or her appearance? Does he or she seem depressed or tired? Are there differences in his or her eating habits (such as weight loss)? Do you notice new symptoms such as anxiety or mood swings? Have other members of the family noticed changes in your loved one? Did others ever say anything bad about him or her? Has anyone else told you about your loved one's behavioral difficulties? Why did you decide to ask me questions about them? Is your loved one doing well, making progress toward recovery or coping with the past? Is there something else bothering your loved one that you haven't seen or heard about?

The most important thing to remember is that the disorders may overlap or coexist. For example, it's possible for someone who has been diagnosed as having BPD but also shows signs of depression and low functioning to have both BPD and another mental illness such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or PTSD. You can help patients by providing information on the different types of these conditions, warning them that their behaviors may be related, and helping them find resources they need, such as counseling, treatment programs, or medications.

Question: I was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome when I was 16 years old. Since then, I've had several personality changes, including extreme shyness. When does a person become autistic? What should I do? Complete Answer: People with autism often present in different ways. Some develop problems at an early age, while others show no observable physical symptoms until adolescence or adulthood. It is not uncommon for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to have a variety of impairments, from mild to severe. However, there is no single diagnosis for all autistic individuals. Some people with ASDs seem to display some combination of social skills, repetitive behaviors (such as rocking), speech delay, and deficits in language development, while others appear to have a lack of social skills but little other physical impairment. Sometimes symptoms are more apparent during childhood, but this doesn't necessarily mean that a child will develop ASD later in life. What is known about the differences between adults with ASD and those without is relatively limited, although research into developmental trajectories suggests that adults with ASD may eventually exhibit significant deficits compared to their peers and relatives. In general, people with ASD tend to live longer than other individuals, are more likely to take time off from work or school, and report higher rates of poverty. Many children with ASD also struggle with peer relations and difficulties relating to others, which might lead to greater isolation and anxiety. Although there is considerable debate over what causes autism, it is believed that genetic factors play a role. Individuals who carry certain mutations in specific genes are much more likely to develop ASD than individuals who don't carry this mutation. Additionally, the risk of developing autism increases if you are older or if your mother or father were diagnosed with autism prior to age 30",114,borderline personality disorder symptoms,-0.1879644095897674,19,multimedqa,1,0.17592592592592593,428,8

For additional information regarding MS, visit its Web site: http://www.remincenetwork.com/MS.aspx. (2) Multiple sclerosis is an immune system disorder that affects the central nervous system. There are two types of multiple sclerosis, each with different causes and treatment options. MS is also called demyelinating multiple sclerosis because it results in nerve cell death. \r

The first type of MS is relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis or MRSA. This disease is usually treated surgically with surgery of the spinal cord, including removal of all but one segment. Treatment is generally given over the course of several months and includes medications such as corticosteroids, steroids, immunosuppressants, antibiotics, and other therapies. Medications used for MS include rituximab, rituximab monotherapy, and rituximab plus interferon beta-1b, which is administered together with standard treatment. The second type of MS is progressive multiple sclerosis or PDMS. This disease develops gradually over years, starting in early adulthood, with symptoms appearing after age 50. The treatment typically begins when patients reach age 50, often during treatment with corticosteroid injections before surgery to remove the entire spleen, which reduces inflammation. Most people who develop this form of MS recover fully within five years of their initial diagnosis. However, there may be some residual neurological damage from the initial attack. Some studies show that the majority of those who relapse do so in their late 60s or even later, suggesting that some MS can persist for decades, perhaps longer than 20 years. \r

In addition to these treatments, the most effective way to prevent the development of new MS and cure it once it occurs is to reduce overall inflammation, eliminate triggers for autoimmunity, and maintain adequate blood flow throughout the body. In addition, people should avoid smoking and drinking alcohol and exercise moderately. Smoking increases the risk of developing both HIV infection and lung cancer. People taking certain drugs that interfere with the function of the immune system, such as steroid hormones, anti-rejection drugs, chemotherapy, and chemotherapy agents specifically designed to stimulate the immune system such as temozolomide (TZDs), have been reported to develop MS more quickly.

In MS, there are several primary causes that can be diagnosed in adults (Mendelian transmission), children (primary demyelinating agents), or pediatric patients (inflammatory processes). At this time, there are no known treatments for MS. One treatment option is to use systemic therapies, which include intravenous immunoglobulin G (IgG) therapy for severe cases; corticosteroids for moderate-to-severe cases; and anti-TNF drugs, such as propranolol (Prilosec); for milder cases. All three types of MS medications may help reduce symptoms, but it is important not to overuse them or to take more than prescribed due to possible side effects. For example, long-term oral steroids used to treat active MS may have detrimental effects on bones, joints, and blood vessels, which can lead to osteoporosis.

For example, your eyes are not centered when looking through your eyeglass frames, so they don't fit correctly. You can tell if your eyeglasses are warped by measuring the distance between where their lenses meet.\nQuestion: how long does it take for my blood pressure to go down after wearing glasses?\nAnswer: This depends upon the person's age, body mass index (BMI) and other factors. For most people, taking regular medication such as aspirin or ibuprofen may help lower blood pressure. However, some individuals may need a more complicated approach than aspirin or ibuprofen alone. In addition, blood pressure medications can cause side effects that are often unpleasant or even dangerous. Some of these include heartburn, nausea, blurred vision, headache, dizziness and feeling faint. Taking any type of prescription drug could also affect your ability to drive safely and make it harder for you to work.

gpt2-large_92,"In the short term, you can reduce the risk of developing a condition called ""fatigue syndrome"" by following these simple steps. First, learn how your body processes food and other nutrients, and develop a good understanding of why certain foods trigger an immune response that makes people feel tired.

Second, start taking steps to avoid triggers that cause fatigue; for example, don't eat fried or salted foods until after bedtime, avoid caffeine before bedtime, and try not to eat sweets, chocolate bars, sodas or fruit juice until after dinner. Take no more than three weeks to make sure your digestive system is functioning well. It's best to begin by reading this article about symptoms associated with stress. If that doesn't work, consult your doctor.

Third, avoid alcohol while you're trying to sleep because it lowers your blood pressure and may aggravate chronic illness (and therefore worsen your fatigue). Also take care when eating out or going on vacations. Don't drink beer or wine, particularly if you have a cold or flu.

Finally, know that many medications used to treat fatigue (such as anticonvulsants) can actually worsen fatigue and increase symptoms. Your doctor will recommend one of several different medications to control your problem. For most patients, these include antihistamines, antidepressants and antipsychotics. Although these drugs can help alleviate some of the symptoms of chronic fatigue, they may be too powerful for severe cases of fatigue.

gpt2-large_22,"yes. \nQuestion: what is the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes? Complete Answer: the two conditions have some of the same symptoms but different causes. There may be some overlap in diagnostic tests performed at the same time. Type 1 Diabetes (T1DM) occurs when your body does not produce enough insulin for the amount of sugar that your cells need. The condition is caused by a defect in how your blood-forming cells handle sugar; it is characterized by excessive production of glucose from the bloodstream rather than the pancreas. You will most likely develop T1DM if you have had problems with weight gain, lack of exercise or insufficient sleep. Your doctor may suggest that you follow a low-carbohydrate diet and/or exercise more during this phase of your disease. Symptoms include loss of appetite, decreased energy levels, fatigue, and sometimes weakness. Most people who get T1DM develop insulin resistance, which increases their sensitivity to insulin. After 5 years on treatment, you should be able to continue normal daily activities without requiring any additional help. However, because there are still risks involved in taking medication for long periods of time, many patients choose to discontinue treatment early and begin eating healthier again. If you wish to change your health status, consult your physician before changing lifestyle habits. Types of Diabetes In addition to the two types of diabetes, there are also three other types of diabetes - juvenile-onset type 1 (juvenile-onset diabetes), adult-onset type 1 (adult-onset diabetes), and advanced-stage type 1 (advanced-stage diabetes). Juvenile-onset Type I (JOTI) Adult-onset Type II (ASMI) JotI Adult-onset Type III (ASV) ASMI Advanced-stage Type I (ASVI) ASVI

Type 1 Diabetes (T1DM) is an inherited disease that affects mainly the young, male population of industrialized countries. It can occur in people of all ages, but most commonly develops during childhood or adolescence. In adults with T1DM, the pancreas produces too little insulin, causing the blood sugar level to rise rapidly as well as putting extra pressure on the heart muscle. As a result, the person becomes severely impaired in several areas of their lives, including mental function, physical function, appetite control, and quality of life.

gpt2-large_86,"\N\The most common form of MS is called primary progressive MS (PPMS). It's the type of MS that people with this disease have. People who are diagnosed as having PPSS usually develop secondary progressive MS later in life. In some cases, it can be a long-term or even lifelong condition for these patients. The two forms of MS are different. Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Symptoms Primary progressive MS (PPS) affects your brain cells and causes them to lose their ability to function normally. These problems range from muscle spasms to vision loss to hearing loss. Treatment depends on how severe the symptoms are. If you feel better after 3 months of treatment, your doctor will probably recommend maintenance therapy. This means that you'll continue to take medicine, but at higher doses for longer periods than usual so that you can maintain a normal level of blood sugar. Once your doctor tells you what dose to take, don't change it until your doctor tells you again. At least twice a year, your doctor should check your glucose levels. You may also need to do extra tests or visits to see if there's something wrong with your blood sugar control. When your doctor orders diabetes tests, they're often done before they've started treating the underlying cause of your diabetes. Many types of diabetes start in childhood and lead to more serious complications later in life. For example, diabetic retinopathy - an eye problem caused by the body not properly regulating the amount of red blood cell - has been found to affect people with PPS. Most commonly, the affected retina becomes dark brown or black. Some experts believe this results from a deficiency in vitamin D. Sometimes, however, the reason behind the yellow color goes undiagnosed. Although most PPS sufferers live much longer than others with this disease, the illness itself isn't always fatal. If all other medical treatments haven't worked, you might still benefit from medication. In some cases, drugs used for treating autoimmune diseases are sometimes prescribed to people with PPS. This is because the condition can mimic autoimmune disorders. Examples include rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease, and inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBD). Your doctor may want to ask you questions to help make sure your medications aren't causing any side effects that are troubling you. The drug used to treat PPS is known as rituximab.

gpt2-large_116,"The rate of clinical trial data available for patients with prostate cancer is limited, especially in the context of high mortality rates among these patients (over 20% lifetime). Many studies have been published on the efficacy of various treatments, including surgery and radiotherapy for localized tumors. However, as there is no approved treatment currently available for metastatic prostate cancers (with or without localizing symptoms), further research is necessary. In addition, many studies that document the effectiveness of other interventions such as lifestyle changes and medication, are not considered by most physicians to be suitable for use as primary care solutions. Nevertheless, several randomized trials are ongoing using testosterone gel or injectable transdermal testosterone for treating early stage localized prostate cancer. Based on this evidence, I recommend that you consult your doctor before initiating any therapies based solely on anecdotal reports from patients. This is because some patients may become aware of their condition through Internet searches or referrals from friends, family members, or colleagues who also believe they are having problems with their prostate gland. It can take at least 6 months after a diagnosis for the first symptoms of active disease to emerge, so it could be years before a physician would consider prescribing any hormonal therapy for prostate cancer treatment. Your doctor will likely ask you which questions to ask if you suspect you might have prostate cancer. Some common questions include: How old do you think I am? What do you know about my sex life? Have I had any personal experience with anything like this before? Is it possible that another person with this problem has treated me successfully? I noticed an increase in blood flow to my prostate when I was younger. Why did I feel this way back then? When did this happen?

If so, what are the best possible actions that a patient should take to reduce his/her risk of death from the condition? Question: What's the difference between the treatment options for men diagnosed with benign prostatitis? Complete Answer: There are two major types of treatment for benign prostatitis; one involves steroid injections and the other involves either hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or hormone blocking agents. Both options involve the administration of certain hormones into the body, typically by injection.

Lactic acidosis is a term used to describe low blood sugar levels because of physical activity, diet, stress, fatigue, and other conditions. The most commonly known cause of this type of illness is Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). T2DM usually develops in adults between ages 20 and 40 years old. In some cases it may also develop later in life. Certain types of cancer also have a higher risk of developing T2DM than normal people. Some types of T2DM can even occur without having any other medical problems.

Question: What is the difference between an acupressure technique for neck pain and a massage technique?\nAnswer: Acupuncture and massages have some similarities in that they both use pressure to stimulate specific areas of the body, but there are significant differences as well. In addition to being able to treat specific injuries or problems, acupuncture can also help relieve muscle tension and reduce aches. Massage has more similarities in terms of its effects on the rest of the body, and it's often used to treat other conditions like back pain.

Question: How do I know which type of massage should be best for my patients?\nAnswer: Many of the basic factors, such as location, intensity, duration, amount of stimulation, and frequency, affect how effective the massage will be and what types of muscles you'll get stimulated. Here are some recommendations based upon your experience with massage therapy. For example, if you've been doing yoga and a particular spot on your upper arm feels tender, try using a gentle downward motion while holding onto something near your elbow. If you have a big bruise under one shoulder, you might prefer to use a light massage; however, when using a lot of pressure to apply pressure on one particular area, this may cause discomfort to other parts of your body.

Question: What is the average cost of massage in my city?\nAnswer: There really isn't any data to provide insight into the price of massage services, so we're assuming a general ballpark figure here. The total cost for a typical session ranges from $30-$60 per hour, depending upon the strength and length of the treatment. You could also expect to spend up to 25% of your total budget on supplies (clothing and toys), although these items should not increase your overall cost.


The good news is that it would take a large number of sessions to equal out the cost of a standard home visit.

Complete Answer: \nWhat kind of information do you need about drugs? How can I find more information about a specific drug? Questions: What's going on with my blood sugar? Complete Answer: \nYour diabetes has been diagnosed by an endocrinologist or pharmacist; it was usually tested for a few years ago, but could be misdiagnosed at any time. Your blood sugars should stay within normal ranges. If they're not, consult your doctor immediately. To see if your blood glucose levels are abnormal, contact your primary care physician. \nQuestions: Which tests will help me determine if I am pregnant? Complete Answer: \nThere are several methods available for determining whether you are pregnant. The most accurate method involves taking a pregnancy test that measures the amount of protein in your placenta before and after delivery. This test indicates whether your baby is developing normally. However, there is no reliable way to know how many weeks along your pregnancy has gone without the testing. Questions: Where can I get free blood pressure medication? Complete Answer: \nThe National Blood Pressure Association (NBPHA) provides free medications and supplies to anyone who needs them. Contact your local NBPHA office to find out where you may receive assistance. For more information about getting free medication, call 1-800-252-4453. \nWhat is a good place to start when seeking additional medical advice? Complete Answer: \nAsk yourself two questions before selecting a professional's recommendation. First, what medical condition am I looking to treat? Second, what is the likelihood of achieving significant results from this treatment? Answers to these questions will help guide you toward a specialist you feel comfortable recommending. The same questions might also apply to other forms of treatment you may choose to pursue. In some cases, a doctor might suggest a different course of action depending on which of the above questions is applicable. Finally, don't forget that no matter how well you think you understand the answer to a question, sometimes that question isn't actually clear. It is important to ask as much as possible.

In contrast, many people who work with children also ask about whether feeding breast milk is appropriate when infants are fed formula. What should a physician do? Physicians must be knowledgeable in this area so that they can provide clear, accurate, nonjudgmental advice regarding nutrition. There are several reasons why physicians may not offer dietary recommendations. First, it would violate their professional duties, including ethical standards as well as those of practicing medicine. Second, some doctors might fear that doing so could lead to a loss of license. Third, there is evidence that patients' perceptions of a doctor's lack of knowledge about nutrition affect how likely they will seek treatment, even if the advice was actually provided. Finally, because many people distrust food companies, doctors might fear that giving them wrong information could cause them to lose business. As one expert told Dr. Katz, ``It is always better to inform than convince.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \3\ This statement came from a telephone interview conducted June 23, 1999. While both parents were interviewed separately, these statements are taken together. It is not possible to verify that either parent's testimony is entirely accurate. On balance, however, it seems reasonable that the two parents may have had some degree of credibility based on their experiences as pediatricians and perhaps their own experience in working with adolescents. Indeed, both parents told me that they had treated their adolescent child for eating disorders and that both did not think it advisable to continue treating the child without addressing his nutritional needs first. In any event, I find it unlikely that, given their past experience, they would make an unsupported decision to treat this patient for eating problems without a thorough evaluation of the patient's nutritional needs.

\nQuestion: How do I prepare for my first appointment?

\nAnswer: Please have a look at your doctor's description of each type of specialty. Ask questions about the benefits and risks associated with taking each drug. You may also wish to read some related articles and follow up with your doctor if you have additional concerns. Also discuss possible alternative treatments before starting therapy. Your doctor will be able to tell you whether these medications will affect your ability to drive, perform daily tasks, sleep, or engage in sexual activity. Some drugs are more likely than others to cause serious side effects, including high blood pressure, seizures, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, heart failure, and death. Talk to your physician about alternatives to medication. Also, ask your doctor about ways to decrease risk factors for adverse reactions.

Your answer is very likely accurate because you have had direct experience with the symptoms described above. The term ""cognitive dysfunction"" was not coined by your doctor but rather refers to the condition known as hyperactivity disorder or ADHD, which has many similar symptoms such as impulsiveness, inattention, distractibility, difficulty focusing, disorganization, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and a decrease in impulse control in children. This is an excellent reason to get help for yourself. There is no cure for ADHD. A thorough medical evaluation by your primary care physician will determine if you should be referred to a specialist or remain on medication. If there is no immediate need for a diagnosis, then you can continue taking your medications at home and avoid having to visit your primary care physician every few months. If the diagnosis of your problem is not urgent, it may take several weeks before you feel that your symptoms improve. In any event, you should start seeing a specialized mental health therapist to treat any current or past psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, mood disorders, eating disorders, and addiction. Your physical health also must improve. As noted above, excessive exercise can increase the concentration of cortisol produced when you eat. Excessive use of alcohol or drugs can also cause high levels of cortisol. Alcohol consumption increases the rate at which cortisol is released from your adrenal glands into circulation. For this reason, people who drink large amounts of alcohol frequently during their lives are at greater risk for hypoglycemia, which decreases blood sugar levels resulting in low energy and loss of coordination.

So even though you may want to stay awake overnight, you'll only see a slight increase in body temperature and probably not enough to cause problems unless you just start drinking too much in the morning.

That means that when you throw a 100 watt incandescent bulb into your house every day for seven years, you'd end up with 1 million lumens. To calculate how many lumens of light are burning per year, simply divide the number of hours you spend sitting in front of the fluorescent tube in question by the number of hours you spend looking at the bulb. For example, a 100 watt bulb would burn off around 200 lumens of energy per hour. If you were burning a 200 watt bulb, you'd burn 4,400,000,000 lumens of energy per year. It would take over four billion years for that amount of energy to be converted to heat, so the next time you look at a 100 watt bulb you might as well go home now!

Complete Answer: \N\N\N\N\N\N Question: how much does it cost to buy an aspirin from a pharmacy? Complete Answer: $1.00 or more Question: do people with asthma have allergies to aspirin? Complete Answer: No. However, there are some things that may cause your body to react to the drug (called allergic reaction). These reactions may be mild and temporary and will pass after one to two days. You should not take an aspirin if you are allergic to anything else in the aspirin. If you develop any severe symptoms (such as hives, swelling of your face, throat, eyes, lips, tongue) within 14 days of taking aspirin, seek immediate medical attention. Allergic Reaction Symptoms There are several types of allergy. Some people who experience symptoms of allergy to aspirin (in addition to hay fever and pollen allergy) also have symptoms associated with other conditions (e.g., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.). Your doctor may refer you to a specialist for testing. This is most often done by a blood test called a chemical sensitization test. The test looks at certain chemicals released into the air when you breathe in dust, fumes, smoke, or other airborne particles. When this happens, the results show whether you are likely to develop allergies to these substances, like those caused by medications. For more information on chemical sensitization tests, see our article How Common Are Chemical Sensitization Tests? A number of different types of medications and their side effects can affect the ability to produce a chemical sensitivity test result. The same medication used for asthma can also make you feel dizzy or nauseated, increase your heart rate, and decrease your breathing rate and pulse. It's important to remember that taking another medication won't stop them from working, but they may reduce the severity of symptoms. Aspirin Side Effects Acute asthma attacks may include shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. Severe or prolonged use of aspirin during pregnancy may lead to birth defects in the fetus. Longer term use of aspirin might actually damage the liver, kidneys, and bones by interfering with enzymes that keep them from breaking down the drugs.

gpt2-large_109,"The cause of this disorder is unknown, but it does occur in animals, primarily cattle, but also sheep. It can be caused by an immune response against the thymus gland, which produces hormones that regulate hormone production. This leads to symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, and weight loss. Other causes include allergic reaction, autoimmune disease, genetic predisposition (such as some types of thyroid disease), pregnancy, and infection with bacteria or viruses. Symptoms usually begin within 2 weeks after birth, but they can continue for years. Treatment is symptomatic treatment (with antiepileptic drugs) and may result in improvement over time if there are no other serious underlying conditions.

I am currently pregnant with my son who has been diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome at birth. My daughter will be a few months older than my son, so I want her to know what this means since she probably won't understand until it's too late. Does the diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome mean you can expect more issues like asthma, allergies, eczema, food intolerance, etc? What would happen if the child were to develop an allergy? Can this affect me during pregnancy? What is it when someone with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome develops a heart problem? Thank you!


Answer


Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is caused by abnormal development of the thymus gland in children whose parents have certain forms of hereditary thymic hyperplasia or thymic insufficiency, often due to inherited diseases. In those cases, thymocytes produce excessive amounts of the hormone TSH, which increases blood clotting in the body. As a result of these changes, the Thymus becomes enlarged and congested. The swelling creates additional difficulties in growth, particularly in infants and young children.

What information do you need to find out if I have MS? Complete Answers: To ensure that all children who are eligible for food stamps receive nutritious foods and nutritional supplements, states must identify certain conditions as having a ""food insecurity"" problem, such as chronic disease, mental disability, pregnancy-induced disabilities, and undernutrition. States also must report data on the number of children enrolled in Medicaid and other government-subsidized programs that provide nutrition assistance. In addition, many families with children with special needs may qualify for free and reduced price school lunches, as long as they meet certain criteria, including being low income, living in an area of poverty, and not receiving state financial aid. If we know that you or one of your family members has MS, then we will ask you questions about your health history, including the following: 1) Current, past, and future diagnoses, including MS; 2) Your race/ethnicity; 3) Whether your spouse is currently receiving Social Security benefits or Disability Insurance benefits; 4) How old were your two kids when they started school; 5) Any additional illnesses you've had since their birth. This information helps us evaluate your eligibility for Medicaid or other federal and state government programs. We'll also use this information to help us determine whether you or any member of your household qualifies for free or reduced price school lunch programs.

This surgery may be done either before or after chemotherapy has been begun. As with any surgical procedure, there will be no postoperative side effects from this surgery. The only other side effect that will occur is an increased risk of infection, but this is easily managed through proper use of antibiotics. Any infections that do develop should be treated immediately by using appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis. After a thorough physical examination of the patient (including breast self-exams), it is generally recommended that the patient undergo some type of radiation therapy. Radiation can be administered via CT scan, X-ray, MRI, or laser beam therapy. If the cancerous tissue in the breast is large enough to require multiple treatments, these treatments can also be performed. In general, it makes sense to begin treatment within 72 hours of receiving the initial report from the primary care physician.

Question: I am pregnant and need to find out if my doctor prescribes birth control pills for me. Does she recommend them? What are they called? Answer: No, the pills mentioned above are not approved for use during pregnancy. You might want to ask your pharmacist which pill(s) is right for you. It is wise to discuss the medication choices with your obstetrician/gynecologist prior to making those decisions. In addition, it would probably be beneficial to consult a family practitioner who knows more about all of your personal lifestyle issues than just about anyone else on staff.

QUESTION: How long does it take to get through school when I'm at the college level? For example, how long does it usually take to graduate high school or college? Answer: About 15 years!

Although many students graduate very quickly, there are many others who graduate much later than expected. Most often, our information comes from graduating high school seniors who graduated between 1996 and 1999. However, we did hear of an earlier student who graduated in 2000!

Complete Answer: For many reasons, including some related to the size of your fallopian tube, you may need to continue on a long course of hormone therapy (hormone replacement therapy), which involves injections of estrogen into your ovaries. This includes either the patch, vaginal ring, transdermal cream, gel, or implant. Some women find they can use a contraceptive method during the post-surgery period. Others opt not to use contraceptives because they believe the risk of developing breast cancer from using this method outweighs any potential benefits. Other people choose not to continue with hormonal birth control at all due to concerns about side effects of other methods of contraception. Women who've had a hysterectomy may want to consider hormone treatment as part of their total care plan for the rest of their lives.

Diabetes - Type 1 Diabetes

The primary goal of diabetes management is control of blood sugar levels within a specific range (usually 6 to 12 mg/dL) while maintaining normal or close to normal body weight. There are three types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. A diagnosis of type 1 diabetes requires a fasting plasma glucose level of at least 5.5 mmol/L. A fasting plasma glucose level of at least 7.0 mmol/L indicates an elevated risk for developing diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes typically live between 10 and 15 years after diagnosis. An average length of stay in the hospital with type 1 diabetes is six weeks. If your diabetes worsens during treatment, you will likely need to be hospitalized until the condition has resolved. In general, if someone who does not currently have type 1 diabetes develops type 1 diabetes, they usually experience an improvement. But, many patients develop long term complications from their disease, including heart failure, kidney damage, amputation, blindness, and other serious consequences. Type 2 diabetes is a much less severe form of diabetes. It results from the breakdown of cells' ability to release insulin into the bloodstream. Since this process is irreversible, it can result in dangerous organ dysfunction and death. With prolonged use of oral medication, these symptoms may occur. Some individuals with type 2 diabetes often need to take insulin injections. Other than a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, there are no known causes of type 2 diabetes. However, researchers suspect that genetic predisposition plays a role. In fact, one out of four Caucasians carry a mutation that disrupts the gene responsible for making insulin. Patients who carry a mutated version of the gene may suffer from type 2 diabetes. A recent study found that individuals with mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were significantly more susceptible to developing type 2 diabetes compared to those without a mutation. These mutations include BRCA1, BRCA2, CACNA1C, and HLA-B27. \nViewed: 0\r

Many folks find that they either want their wisdom teeth removed altogether or that removing just half of the root canal usually does it.

They think that it is some kind of incurable disease and they don't understand why someone should be able to do anything about it. It's not, and often times they just aren't informed enough to make any educated decision. The best way to share information with others is through clear descriptions of what one does (what you do) on an everyday basis.

Exercise may improve your general sense of wellbeing, as well as your mood and memory.\nQuestion: when can I expect my child's first steps? \nAnswer: Your baby will probably start walking at around 6 months old. He or she should be able to walk barefoot on grass, dirt, rocks, and other surfaces until age 5. By then, he or she should have started climbing stairs by his or her own accord. At that point you can encourage him or her to get up and try some activities like pushups, situps, and pull-ups (or just take them for a spin). If he or she isn't interested in starting new things, you can give it a few years and see if they choose their own routes. The key here is to not overtrain your child; don't rush him or her too early! This is especially true for older children who can become very picky about what they want from their parents. Many babies find playing with toys challenging at first, but they quickly learn how to control themselves. While younger kids might enjoy being held and cuddled, it takes longer for them to develop this skill. As they grow into adolescence, your toddler will most likely begin to explore their world independently of you. Eventually, he or she will need more supervision than usual, particularly if he or she's walking down the street to play or exploring new terrain. You'll still help him or her along by making sure everything goes smoothly—but now you can provide lots of different kinds of encouragement, so your child won't feel overwhelmed. Ask questions later in the day so your child knows what to do next. When you're done talking, ask another question. \nQuestion: how much sleep does my child usually need? \nAnswer: Your baby's needs are determined by your child's age, growth rate, and developmental stage. During the first year of your child's life, he or she may need between 3 and 4 hours of sleep per night. After that, he or she tends to require between 6 and 7 hours of sleep per night.

For example, if you do yoga, walking, or tennis exercises to burn calories and get more oxygen in your blood, then you should try a strength routine that will help with those activities. However, if you like to go running or rollerblading to build muscle mass or have a general interest in fitness, then it's fine to do some strength training as well. Exercise programs can include basic movement drills, such as push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups, and so forth. Or they might include more advanced exercises that require additional strength. \nAs for where to start, choose one workout program at a time that works best for you. After choosing your program, you may need to modify it slightly depending on how much activity you'll be doing during your training period. Most people find that their first few days on a new program don't feel too bad; but after a couple of weeks, you can expect pain in certain joints, especially knees and ankles. If this happens, you may need to take a few months off of strength training before getting back into it. Finally, most people who gain a lot of muscle mass tend not to notice any improvement after a year or two. It is important for you to continue strong workouts throughout your life and to adjust your training schedule accordingly. This way, you won't get hurt and you'll retain all the benefits from regular strength training.

The cause of this unpleasant sensation can vary depending on your age and sex. Your child may or may not have it; most women never do.\nQuestion: What are the symptoms of flu and what should I do if im sick with it?\nAnswer: Flu can cause cold sweats and chills, nausea, fever, headache, neck stiffness, dizziness, dry mouth, body aches, irritability, fatigue, weakness, joint pains, loss of appetite, and vomiting.

Then follow up by checking your bleeding regularly. Stop taking your medication as directed. Never stop bleeding with medicines for heart disease because it has been linked to heart attack.

Basic Information About Hair Growth In order to understand the role of hair, it is necessary to first identify its structure.\nHair consists of keratin (a type of connective tissue), cells, and the proteins called\nepithelial growth factor (EGF).\nEpithelial growth factor plays a crucial role in keeping hair in place and protecting it against damage. Without it, hairs could become damaged. It can also stimulate hair growth through several different mechanisms.\nIn women, keratin contains cholesterol, fatty acids, and carbohydrates. This is why hair growth occurs when estrogen levels rise during pregnancy or when a woman has a period.

Complete Answer: Yes. Even if you think it is safe to eat, do so only slowly, particularly if your symptoms worsen. While eating foods that contain sugar, salt, or fat increases the risk of developing diabetes, eating foods rich in fiber improves blood flow to the brain and prevents damage. It helps your body digest food better. If you find yourself having difficulty concentrating or remembering things because your eyes are glazed over, stop eating and drinking until you can perform these tasks correctly again.

This could cause an increase in depression. \nQuestions: How often does my doctor prescribe the oral corticosteroid meds that I'm taking? Complete Answer: Your physician recommends the lowest dose and duration of each prescription when possible. However, some drugs that are commonly prescribed by doctors will be available over-the-counter at most pharmacies throughout the United States. Your doctor will tell you what products are available over the counter.

You should not apply excessive amounts of products as they tend to irritate or burn your face and eyelids. \nQuestion: What kind of masks should I use when applying sunscreen? Complete Answer: If you want something strong enough to shield your sensitive skin from the sun, then I would say try a mask made from natural ingredients such as aloe vera gel or coconut water. A good option is to go with an oil based mask, like this Aloe Vera Gel Mask by Aloe Vera Australia. Other options include using glycerin-based masks (like this Aloe Vera Glycerine Mask) which don't contain harmful chemicals, or even just plain old moisturiser. \nQuestion: How does parabens affect my skin? Complete Answer: Parabens are used in some cosmetics to protect the surface from the damaging effects of UV radiation. However, studies show that people who are exposed to certain types of parabens, especially those found naturally in foods, may experience increased risk of skin cancer. Studies also suggest that paraben exposure may cause changes to the way our DNA works, so if you're concerned about your skin and want to reduce its exposure to parabens, make sure you avoid foods high in parabens (such as white bread). In addition, consider using paraben-free cleansers, sunscreens and anti-aging creams to help prevent any further damage. \nQuestion: What is a vitamin D3 supplement? Complete Answer: Vitamin D3 supplements are usually sold as capsules containing a synthetic version of the hormone. They're often marketed as being an effective way to boost your levels. There isn't much evidence that they work though, either in terms of helping improve your health or improving the appearance of your skin. While many people will find them attractive, there is no proven benefit to taking them and it is highly recommended against taking them.

gpt2-large_98,"The following is an excerpt from a survey of 1,000 pregnant women who were asked questions related to pregnancy (and their experiences):


When did you become pregnant? What was the first symptom of labor or birth? Where were you when this happened? When did you have your last period after conception? Did it happen before or during your third month of pregnancy? What caused the pain and bleeding that occurred at delivery? How long did it take you to recover? Are you still breastfeeding your baby? Was there any physical change during pregnancy? Was there any difference between the types of birth that took place for both mother and baby?

The information contained in these surveys provides valuable data. It can help us create new products for our customers and improve our services. If your query contains several categories such as ""birth"" and ""pain"", we can use one of two methods to narrow down the list of possible responses. The first method will only include those items which accurately describe what had actually taken place during each stage of pregnancy and childbirth. The second method will also provide the most accurate information but will exclude any items that would not be meaningful for our customers due to their nature. For example, a question such as, ""How long did you nurse your baby?"" may answer more effectively if we excluded items such as ""the baby cried while I held him,"" because then the answer could mean something other than ""he was crying while I nursed him.""",98,most common complications in pregnancy,-12.09411907196045,163,multimedqa,2,0.9157303370786517,255,4

It can automatically detect when you fall asleep based on factors such as how much time has passed since you last slept, how long it took you to get to bed, and whether or not you have fallen asleep during the day. The Sleep Monitor app also tells you if your body clock is off by an hour each night.

2nd, it's very important that you eat enough food throughout the day—especially during the first few hours of the day. Eating too little will increase appetite and cause weight gain (the ""fad dieting"" trend). \nAlso, don't be afraid to take supplements—they're good for your brain and immune system too!

\n\n Question: What can I do if I am having problems getting insurance coverage for a prescription drug?\nAnswer: Ask your prescriber about the policy you may qualify for and review your options for obtaining a waiver from Medicare Part D.

\n\n Question: What is your opinion about ""personal responsibility"" programs which encourage employers to pay for workers' compensation when their injuries result from negligence?\nAnswer: Personal responsibility is not a good idea. It encourages employers to believe that they must compensate workers who sustain personal injury without regard to whether any fault can be assigned to them for causing the accident. Unfortunately, many employers take advantage of these programs by requiring employees to purchase expensive products, like cars, while working in their facilities. Employers also often fail to reimburse injured workers for lost wages. A recent survey found that only 7% of employers had paid out benefits for car repairs performed by their own employees. By discouraging the hiring of individuals with preexisting conditions, personal responsibility could lead to high costs and poor outcomes for those who are injured by others. \r

All questions will be used by medical professionals to help determine if you're likely to experience symptoms from any specific drug, food, herbal supplement, etc. A typical question may include: \1) What does ""symptoms"" mean for you? What could you potentially experience? How do you expect these symptoms to affect your life? Do you feel that your overall health would improve with treatment? \2) Have you noticed anything unusual about your symptoms? Are there others who have suffered the same problems as you? Is there something else you can do if you haven't been able to find someone who's had similar problems? \3) Did you notice any improvement in your quality of life while you were treated for MS?

Given that you'll probably live only two years, let us consider four different scenarios, each involving your decision to take a particular medication. The first scenario, which assumes that you choose an aggressive regimen of medicine that leads to full recovery within six months, asks whether MS will be caused by the drug you take and how it may impact your quality of life during that period.

gpt2-large_54,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system that affects the brain. Symptoms may start in childhood or as an adult, can affect both men and women, and vary from person to person. MS causes fatigue, pain, and other symptoms, often with little warning. The disease progresses over time, typically after 5 years. When symptoms do appear, they're usually severe, such as muscle stiffness, numbness and weakness, confusion, loss of vision, or difficulty speaking. Your doctor will determine whether you have MS based on your symptoms alone and your overall health history. It's important to speak to your primary care provider if you think you may be at risk for MS. You should also consult a specialist who specializes in MS. In addition, you might consider getting screened for certain cancers. For more information about this issue, see How to Get Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis. \r

Example: A woman tells her doctor she feels tired all the time during the day but doesn't have any trouble sleeping; however, her sleep apnea keeps waking her up at night. Her doctor will likely diagnose her with fibromyalgia syndrome, which means her illness is characterized by frequent bouts of painful muscles.

Question: I'm concerned about my cat's behavior. Is it normal to have different patterns of anger or irritation toward people when he gets angry? If so, how much difference does it make to him? Answer: Cats sometimes get ""angry"" when upset. This happens because their brains have evolved to respond instinctively to situations that cause distress. So, whenever cats experience discomfort, they may exhibit these behaviors. Examples include snapping, scratching at objects, biting and even urinating on furniture. Cat owners need not worry too much about what their pets are doing when they become agitated. They'll usually calm down soon enough once the situation passes, although some owners say that their dogs don't always behave well around cats.\n",54,What does multiple sclerosis diagnosis include?

gpt2-large_52,"The major problem with mental health is that it's difficult to diagnose and treat. When you have no idea what's wrong, you're more likely to be anxious and depressed instead of feeling better. But there are some very simple ways to reduce your anxiety and depression: 1) Know what you want in life, 2) know how to get there, 3) take care of yourself so you feel good enough for when you do get there, and 4) know where to find support and resources if needed. You'll also need to learn how to cope with stress and keep it under control. To help increase your self-confidence, seek out positive role models who've overcome their mental health problems.

Complete Answer: Sadness isn't sad because it doesn't satisfy us; rather, it's sad because we don't have anything to give. And it's not a bad thing. It's just that sometimes we make it too painful to face up to our feelings, which makes them worse. So, while your sadness might seem like it's only temporary, it's really more like a long journey. Most people can experience a little bit of sadness during a time of high intensity. Just remember that sadness is usually temporary, not permanent. There are different types of sadness and each type has its own characteristics. For example, low emotional pain (such as fear) has physical effects. High emotional pain (such as anger) has psychological ones. These characteristics don't always reflect the same things that we see as negative emotions. Sometimes people have great difficulty seeing themselves as having low emotional pain, even though they believe that they are experiencing high emotion. Often we don't realize that we often have extreme highs, and vice versa. That said, it's",52,What are the most common mental health problems?

The U.S. is currently in the midst of an alarming epidemic of autoimmune thyroid disorders (autoimmune thyroiditis) with over 600,000 Americans suffering from one or more cases each year. In fact, according to the National Cancer Institute there are now approximately 1 million new thyroid cancer cases every year alone. One third of those diagnosed were under age 60 at the time of diagnosis! These new diagnoses also occur frequently among women who had not experienced any prior autoimmune thyroid disease.

Treatment options include surgery for menopause replacement (MRS), iodine supplementation (I) and/or thyroid hormone replacement therapy (THR). The current treatment options for thyroid dysfunction including I and/or TH include the following:


Dietary Restriction : While these diets usually focus on controlling blood sugar levels, they do not address the underlying cause which lies within the cells themselves. Unfortunately, modern food processing methods produce foods that contain too much fructose, glucose, and other carbohydrates which triggers immune response causing inflammation and inflammation leading to autoimmunity. This leads to a vicious cycle of chronic inflammation leading to further deterioration of your internal organs causing further damage. A diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy products, legumes, nuts, seeds and alcohol helps reduce inflammation but does not eliminate it. Your body will respond by making more insulin (and less glucagon) which increases appetite leading to weight gain leading to hyperglycemia resulting in metabolic syndrome. As diabetes increases the risk of developing heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, obesity, depression and other health problems associated with autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammation. Thus, lifestyle changes should be made to reduce inflammation.


Anti-Inflammatories : Anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin, Tylenol, acetaminophen and others can help relieve pain due to inflammatory reactions caused by excessive inflammation. However, if you develop arthritis then anti-inflammatories may no longer be effective so a dietary change needs to be made in order to prevent joint pain or osteoarthritis.

Exercise : Although most exercise programs focus on improving cardiovascular fitness in addition to muscle strength and endurance; the opposite is true when it comes to preventing injuries. By getting enough sleep (6+ hours daily) and exercising regularly, we ensure our muscles are functioning properly and avoiding injury. Additionally, some studies indicate that an aerobic workout",123,hypothyroidism symptoms,-11.459372520446776,120,multimedqa,2,0.7407407407407407,391,0

Your doctor will probably not order more than this amount each day for you because the drugs he prescribes can cause side effects such as dry mouth or sleeplessness if you take too much. If you feel like it is going to be a problem, call your doctor so that they can order more medication.\nQuestion: pain relief\nComplete Answer: To relieve the aches and pains in your joints, you may want to try ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) 10mg to 20mg tablets twice daily for 3 days before taking an injection of acetaminophen (Tylenol). A combination of acetaminophen and aspirin (Aracil, Tums, Aleve) should work well. The best dose for patients with acute pain is 25mg to 50mg once every 8 hours. If you experience pain at night, you may increase the dose to 50mg three times every 4 hours until bedtime. Do not give acetaminophen to children under 12 months old because it has been shown to slow their growth. Give only when the person with arthritis says that he/she cannot tolerate it anymore and there is no other treatment available. For chronic conditions that require frequent injections, there are several options, including: -Medication called Arvin (Vitamix)

-A local injection for ulcers (Penicillin G, Micronase)

-Pediapine (Aleve) For chronic conditions that don't require frequent injections, you might consider: -Injectable anti inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium and others

-Surgery for osteoarthritis

-Surgical implantation of a prosthesis, including a pacemaker or a valve replacement that moves blood from one part of the body to another

-Infusion of insulin to help control blood glucose levels

-Intravenous immunoglobulin for type 1 diabetes

-Surgery to remove bone marrow cells and replace them with stem cells and stem cell transplants For severe cases, you may prefer to go without any treatment altogether.

A number of MS support centers are available throughout the country, some of which may be able to provide more comprehensive or specific information than others. It's important to remember that people with MS often have different needs than those who do not. For example, someone who has had MS for many years might not need as much help as someone just starting out on their road to recovery. When you're looking for information, it's best to speak directly with your primary care physician, who will give you more specific guidance than if you contact other individuals or organizations through the Internet. This will allow you to get the most appropriate information in a timely fashion. \r

One benefit of having an MS support center is that they will answer questions that have been posed to them by consumers, including things like how long does MS take to recover? What treatments work best for patients with MS? Do I need any special medications or supplements when recovering from MS? If so, what is the right dose for me? Are there any side effects of certain drugs? Is there anything else that could possibly be contributing to my recovery? These kinds of questions and more can help you find solutions to problems you might otherwise never discover.

gpt2-large_92,"there are many factors that affect the development of fatigue (see question #2)

Answer 1 is as follows: \begin{equation*} \label{1}\mathrm{FAT} = -\frac{\phi}{3\pi}\end{equation*} In fact, an appropriate answer would be \begin{equation*} \label{1}\mathrm{FAT} = -\frac{\phi}{4\pi}\end{equation*}. This can help us understand why some people experience more pain when using their mobile devices than others. For example, if you have suffered from chronic back problems, you may have experienced significant pain or muscle spasms while typing on your mobile device. It's not unusual for this type of pain to linger long after you stop using your phone. The problem with that symptom is, once it has gone away, you will no longer feel any difference between how much you typed and how much you felt. By definition, the fatigue you experienced on that day was caused by all the other things you had done during that time. Thus, although you did get tired, the cause of your fatigue was entirely different than what you expected. So the actual cause of fatigue in MS was not fatigue at all, but something else.

When I first started using my MS smartphone, the battery would start to die within minutes. While you were browsing through a web page on your laptop or desktop computer, the battery would go dead before long. Even though you've probably never seen or heard anyone complain of such symptoms in the past, it still bothered me because you didn't realize just how badly your battery used up over the course of just one use. For example, I typically read books and magazines from 3 am until 4 am. After reading one page and taking some photos, I could take another look at the same page at 2 pm, leaving little time for anything else. If that was going to happen every few hours, then the battery drain would quickly become unmanageable—even when you weren't even doing anything! It's hard to believe that someone who uses his/her cell phone only several times per day isn't running out of power fast. If we consider just one short usage (say, 10 seconds), this extra 20% battery drain adds up quickly.

Complete Answer: The odds that an individual is pregnant when they become sick is 1 in 100,000. It's best not to consider having a miscarriage unless there was something very serious happening to make it medically advisable. For example, if your baby died shortly after birth or you were experiencing severe vomiting or diarrhea. These circumstances could potentially cause the pregnancy to end early. In these cases, talk with your doctor about whether it's safe to continue the pregnancy. Remember, every woman is unique so it's important for each of them to have their own personal choices about how to treat themselves if they decide to become pregnant again after having recently miscarried. Questions for Support Question: What happens if I don't follow the guidelines for eating right? Complete Answer: The next time you eat food from your grocery store, restaurant, or other place where food is sold, ask yourself if this food would be allowed under federal health law or state law. Some states require businesses to provide calorie counts of any foods sold in stores; others allow restaurants, cafeterias, or other places selling food to sell the menu items even though they're labeled ""fat free."" Many states also require manufacturers of packaged meals such as sandwiches to indicate if the ingredients come from animals. Food labeled as ""100 percent whole grain"" doesn't mean all of its carbohydrates come from whole grains but instead comes from corn or wheat. And many states require manufacturers of prepared foods such as soups and salads to list the amount of sodium, total fat, saturated fat, sugar, potassium, magnesium, fiber, calcium, vitamins A and E, vitamin C, beta carotene, and iron.

gpt2-large_68,"MS is the most common degenerative neurological disease in the United States. Its prevalence varies widely between individuals; in general, people aged 50 years or older account for approximately 60% of all cases. However, certain subtypes have been associated with higher incidence rates; for example, an estimated 1 million Americans with multiple sclerosis suffer from multiple myeloma (a cancer of bone marrow) and an estimated 2 million adults have relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The causes of MS remain unknown, but it has been suggested that immune system overstimulation contributes to its severity, which may be due to a combination of genetics and environmental factors.\r

In addition, MS can affect people who do not exhibit signs and symptoms, such as those without a family history of MS or who had no previous illnesses prior to the onset of the illness. In fact, the exact reason why some people develop the debilitating disease after having normal brain function remains unclear.\r

There are several types of MS; however, the most commonly diagnosed is MS, which affects both males and females equally. People with MS typically report headaches, dizziness, stiffness, fatigue, depression, nausea, vision changes, loss of balance, difficulty speaking, muscle weakness, numbness, tingling sensations, pain, and swelling. Other reported physical effects include difficulty swallowing and/or chewing, sensitivity to light, color, texture, taste, smell, and touch, hearing disorders, and difficulty seeing or focusing. Some people also experience memory problems, confusion, irritability, anxiety, hallucinations, insomnia, and paranoia. Some of these symptoms go away on their own, but others appear worse if left untreated.\r

MS is generally treated successfully with medications that improve overall functioning, reduce disability, decrease disability progression, and prevent recurrence. Because of the limited evidence base, however, specific treatments are not recommended and are only indicated by specific clinical tests. For example, immunotherapy is used to treat active MS patients with antibodies against two viruses involved in the development of the disease. The drugs stimulate the body's production of a type of antibody called cytotoxic T cells to destroy the infection. Cytotoxicity is often difficult to demonstrate with standard clinical trials because the test must be repeated twice during treatment before a statistically significant difference occurs. In contrast, many new anti-cancer therapies are being developed with the goal of reducing the tumor growth rate in animals. This approach aims to increase the survival time of patients following initial treatments to less than 10 months, at which point",68,List of multiple sclerosis symptoms,-0.4284120798110962,6,multimedqa,2,0.027149321266968326,403,20
gpt2-large_57,"This is not a single disease process. When you see the symptoms of multiple sclerosis, they may be signs of one or more conditions that are all in your body, or other causes not yet fully understood. For example, you may have pain as your brain tries to heal itself from damage caused by the inflammatory process that leads up through your spinal cord to affect your peripheral nervous system (which controls things like muscle spasms). You may also feel weakness as muscles get weaker and can't control movement as you age. These are just some examples of diseases that develop at different rates or when people are older than normal.\nQuestion: What are the four major types of MS? Complete Answer: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) occurs as part of an autoimmune disease called rheumatoid arthritis. In this case, it's a systemic immune reaction triggered by the bacteria in our guts, known as enteropathogens, which produce chemicals that attack the lining of our blood vessels, causing inflammation. The condition affects the nerves that deliver messages to the brain, affecting your vision, speech, balance, thinking, memory, coordination, and sensation in your hands, feet, arms, neck, and face. It's often accompanied by other problems such as fever, joint swelling, nausea, weight loss, fatigue, depression, memory impairment, seizures, numbness/tingling, and paralysis. Many people with MS will experience the following symptoms: difficulty walking

weakness in limbs

vision changes

fatigue

muscle cramps

sensitivity to light

dizziness

Complete Answer: A prescription for either can be given if you have symptoms of menopause or need to stop taking your OCP. If you do not use your OCP, the pill may continue to work as well. It's important to know that you cannot take it again without your doctor's permission. If you start taking a new OCP, you will probably have changes in your menstrual cycle. You should avoid taking more than one OCP at a time for several weeks before you decide whether or not you want another. For more information, call 1-800-FDA-1088. Question: I've been using birth control pills, but my periods are late. Why doesn't this mean I'm pregnant? Answer: Birth control pills (the second-generation kind) make sure the body gets used to having sex. When a woman has her period, there are usually no signs of pregnancy because her blood levels of estrogen and progesterone stay normal after ovulation. However, your blood tests will show the absence of sperm in your urine. The only way a man could get pregnant from intercourse with a woman who hasn't had her period is if he ejaculated inside her vagina. If you don't have any obvious symptoms of pregnancy, such as swollen breasts or bleeding on your arm, you aren't pregnant yet. Ask your provider for advice. \nQuestion: My uterus hurts so much when I pee. Is it possible to get rid of it? Answer: This depends on how often you urinate. Your cervix closes during your monthly cycles, preventing urine from coming out. That means, if you have unprotected vaginal intercourse four times per month, your uterine lining won't close all the way and urine will leak out through a hole in the top. If you're worried about leaking urine throughout the day, ask your practitioner to check your lab results. If you still think you might have a problem, talk to your gynecologist. He'll tell you what precautions to follow and give you suggestions for reducing the pain.

If you feel like you are getting old, or just want a change, consider trying hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

Question: Is it true that many vaccines have ingredients that are harmful for babies? Complete Answer: Vaccines come in several forms; some contain only partially active ingredients (e.g., vaccine) while others contain whole-body components and may include substances that interfere with normal immune function. These adverse reactions occur in less than 1 percent of all cases, so an infant's immune system is still healthy enough to receive a dose of this type of vaccine even after being exposed. Although not nearly as prevalent as the flu shot, many infants are vaccinated every year due to their need for specific protection against viruses and bacteria. Therefore, any possible safety concerns must be addressed in addition to the benefits of vaccination.",93,Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?,-0.0372496023774147,2,multimedqa,2,0.010101010101010102,225,18
gpt2-large_72,"The use of this vaccine is not recommended because of the risk of severe side effects from corticosteroids in high doses or long periods of time after vaccination. The Covid-19 vaccine was introduced into the U.S. market as an alternative to other vaccines that could cause serious adverse reactions such as fever, headache, or skin rash (fever caused by inflammation of the body's immune system). Some older clinical studies have reported serious allergic reactions to the vaccine. For example, two cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome were linked to Cervarix® VE vaccine in the 1990s; one case involved a person who developed flu-like symptoms six months after receiving the vaccine; and the second case included a child who developed acute hepatitis due to the presence of mercury-containing thimerosal in the vaccine.[14] In addition, there has been concern over whether children with autism may be at increased risk for developing the disease if they receive the vaccine before age 18 months. While it is impossible to know definitively why some children develop autism even when given the full schedule of vaccines, researchers cannot rule out the possibility that the vaccines might contribute to the development of the condition.[15]

Many parents report that their children do not get any of the flu shots, and that it causes them to feel better sooner. However, there is no evidence that these claims are true. In fact, the majority of research indicates that flu vaccinations only increase the chance of getting a mild illness; some studies indicate that even one dose of the flu shot may significantly reduce your chances of catching influenza. There is also mounting scientific evidence that suggests that having a cold can worsen your condition. Many parents believe the reason their children appear better soon after having received the flu shot is because it makes them look healthier than they actually are. Unfortunately, however, many of these individuals fail to realize that it takes several days for a flu virus to grow. Most scientists agree that influenza viruses don't grow well after exposure to temperatures below 38°F (2°C) for up to three weeks. Moreover, people often experience flu like symptoms without experiencing the flu-like symptoms. In fact, the last recorded case of someone contracting the disease in the United States occurred in 1957—a year before vaccines became available.[16] For more information on how the flu works, visit CDC.gov/flu.

Complete Answer: Many of these illnesses begin in adolescence and continue into adulthood. People with schizophrenia often experience auditory hallucinations, delusions, self-mutilation, loss of social relationships, anxiety, irritability, aggression, depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation. Often when people report hearing voices they believe are coming from their environment or those around them, the voices become more intense.\nQuestion: How does having a mental illness affect my work performance? Complete Answer: Work performance is influenced by many factors including, but not limited to, stress, job strain, personal problems that arise from being affected by mental illness, job-related injuries, physical ailments such as arthritis and back pain, and emotional problems stemming from living in an environment where people are prone to discrimination and violence. It would be wise for individuals suffering from any kind of mental disorder to seek out professional counseling and treatment. When someone reports feeling depressed, anxious, isolated, angry, tired or hopeless, seek help right away. You could also try contacting a support group which might provide advice on coping with these issues and offer a referral network for resources. Please remember that everyone has different strengths and needs. For example, someone suffering from bipolar disorders will likely need more attention than a person with schizophrenia. Some people with severe mental illness require medication (e.g., antipsychotics) and others don't. You should make sure that you're fully informed before making decisions regarding treatment, medication, and lifestyle changes that may affect your well-being.\nQuestion: What happens to me after I'm diagnosed?

gpt2-large_113,"\nAs the name suggests, aspartame is a sweetener which is used in some foods, such as soft drinks, fruit juice, baked goods, cereals, and other processed food products. Aspartame has been approved for use by the FDA to treat certain types of asthma. However, because it is not generally recognized that aspartame can cause adverse effects on humans, it was not classified as a drug until 1999. Aspartame contains a sucrose derivative, phenylalanine. The most commonly consumed form of this compound is found in beverages such as soda pop and sports drinks. Aspartame does not appear to be associated with any serious adverse health effects.\nQuestion: heartburn and \ncomplications that may occur during a meal\nAnswer: \nIn general, heartburn caused by foods is considered a symptom of stomach acid production. Although aspartame does not have an effect on human digestion or absorption, it can result in a temporary reduction of gastric acid secretion due to its metabolic conversion into L-aspartate. This makes it difficult to tell whether a food is actually causing your symptoms or if you're just having a bad day. For example, if a person consumes large amounts of chocolate milk or sugary cereal, then they could be suffering from gastrointestinal distress when eaten after eating a big bowl of ice cream. Other people might also experience gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which causes frequent episodes of severe stomach pain when consuming high levels of carbohydrates or sugars. In the case of aspartame, a small number of studies have indicated that individuals who consume large amounts of low-calorie products -- such as cookies, chips, candy bars, and breakfast cereals -- should avoid taking their medication at all while taking aspartame.

While there is no evidence linking aspartame consumption to cancer, it has been implicated in several cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, colorectal carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, kidney cancer, and oral cavity/pharynx carcinoma. It has also been linked to premature death in those with pre-existing renal insufficiency. These problems can only be prevented by avoiding excessive intake of aspartame (such as using it judiciously) and by preventing chronic exposure to aspartame in general.",113,asthma and covid,-11.248703956604004,191,multimedqa,2,0.8721461187214612,351,6

When babies first develop, their upper limbs don't always grow properly. When they reach 2 years old, they usually need some extra support for growth. Try some simple neck and shoulder stretches. These can help keep your baby's arms, legs, neck, chest, and lower back healthy and strong. \nQuestion: How do I know if my son has a birth defect? Complete Answer: First and foremost, check his head size. A larger head means more weight at the end of his body. Also, if he has a cleft palate, there will likely be fewer teeth than normal because his mouth can move around the way that a kid with no clefts has. Some things are more obvious than others; that's why we ask questions like, ""Do you find that your belly button makes it harder for him to get out?"" If he doesn't seem confused by this question, then he probably hasn't yet been born. And he may have just had surgery which might make him look different in the future. So, if you see any of those signs, start looking up information about birth defects. But before you go searching for information online, you should also consult with your doctor or midwife about your son's birth risk factors. Your midwife can tell you how many children you'll have, how much time your child will spend breastfeeding, and whether he needs special care for certain types of birth injuries or infections, such as urinary tract infection (UTI), preeclampsia, low birthweight, and premature rupture of membranes (PPO). She can also give advice about birth positions and how often you'll be able to visit her office and how she might feel comfortable helping you with childbirth.

gpt2-large_117,"Stage 4 of melanoma is known as ""metastasis,"" which means that the tumor is spread through tissues (including blood vessels) in order for it to become more resistant to treatment. The most advanced form of metastasis usually occurs when there is an increase in white blood cells or lymphocytes and the cells multiply rapidly to fill up the surrounding tissue. This type of metastasis can be deadly for patients who have not yet developed any symptoms or complications from their disease. Unfortunately, there is no way to predict with certainty how many new tumors will develop because the rate at which these cancers grow varies so widely among individuals. In general, the longer a person lives, the more likely they are to experience additional invasive malignant growths. \nQuestion: what should I do if my family doctor refuses to accept me? Complete Answer: First, make sure you ask for help from a trusted physician or other medical source. Second, try to keep your illness private, since doing so could put yourself in danger. And third, even though the disease may have progressed, doctors cannot diagnose all forms of cancer by looking inside the body. Sometimes doctors believe that certain types of tumors, like those that involve the lungs, heart, liver or brain, aren't treated enough or can't be diagnosed effectively unless they are found elsewhere. If this happens to you, talk to a lawyer and/or a friend who knows someone who has had such a diagnosis. It doesn't hurt to contact your local cancer center or see a registered nurse before making a decision on whether to go public with your story. They'll probably be able to tell you where to find information. \nQuestion: What is a metastasis? Complete Answer: A metastasis occurs when new cancer spreads throughout the body (from the surface of the skin into the bloodstream). Often the only way to get rid of the cancer is to remove it completely from the patient's system or, sometimes, transplant it to another part of the body. But since cancer often spreads around the organs that support them, such as the bone marrow and lymph nodes, one must also look outside for any tumors that might be spreading from within. To determine if there are metastases, researchers study the appearance of the cancer over time, using a technique called tissue culture, which involves taking healthy, genetically identical cell samples from various parts of the body and then isolating the cells from the blood, urine, saliva or the tissue of a living animal.\nQuestion: How much does it cost to treat metastatic breast cancer?

gpt2-large_101,"The flare can be caused by many different factors. In general, the most likely cause is that you have an enlarged thyroid gland, and the excess iodine (if it's present) may build up in your blood stream as a result of your elevated levels of iodine in your food or body fluids. When this happens, if not corrected, the thyroid gland becomes inflamed and produces too much of its own iodine, causing inflammation (irritation), which results in increased tissue damage and, ultimately, cancer (and death). A doctor must determine what kind of treatment is needed to correct the problem. There are several approaches available for treating the symptoms of hypothyroidism—in addition to thyroid hormone replacement therapy (which will restore your normal levels of thyroid hormones), there are also other treatments such as dietary changes, exercise, vitamin D supplementation, medication, and/or surgery.

Answer 2: Iodine deficiency is the second leading cause of cancer (after smoking.)

Iodine is essential to life. Unfortunately, we humans do not produce enough naturally occurring iodine. This leads to severe problems with metabolism and nervous system function due to deficiencies of iodine in our diet and environment. Our bodies naturally secrete small amounts of iodine from the skin, muscle tissues, hair, bones, organs, digestive tract, liver, and brain. We don't need to take supplements, but doing so can help to prevent certain diseases.

Question: How is iodine produced?

Answer 3: Most of the iodine you consume comes from eating foods that contain iodine (such as seaweed, egg yolk, citrus fruits, sea vegetables, nuts, garlic, soybean products, and fish oil). You also absorb some iodine through drinking water. But when you eat more iodine than you would otherwise get, your body manufactures larger amounts of radioactive iodide. That means that you may need to take extra precautions, even while traveling or during times where iodine supplements might be readily available.

Why does iodine become dangerous after ingestion?

Because of iodine's role in our bodies, it has been linked to adverse effects ranging from heart disease, stroke, osteoporosis, and multiple sclerosis to cancer, immune dysfunction, and even neurological disorders like dementia. It has been suggested that high consumption of iodine may increase the risk of developing cancers in various parts of the body.

Complete Answer: yes and no. There are two main types of magnesium: Magnesium sulfate (methionine) and Magnesium citrate (sodium). While you can get both at most grocery stores, they're not interchangeable. You'll see many doctors prescribing an over-the-counter form of magnesium sulfate such as Magnesium Citrate 100% MgSO4 or Magnesium Cetearate 200%. These are both fine if your doctor has prescribed them, but be sure to ask your pharmacist if any have been added to your prescription. If you don't feel better after taking one tablet, talk to your physician about switching brands. One study showed that people who took either magnesium sulfate or citrate had higher levels of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex than those given magnesium only. \nAsk Dr. Money: What's your favorite way to relax?

I think this can actually help me sleep less efficiently since I stop thinking about things all night long. The key with relaxing though is to find a comfortable position where your body doesn't move too much. Also, try to avoid stressful situations whenever possible. If something happens at school, family emergencies, and other events, let go of any anxiety and just enjoy the moment.

gpt2-large_108,"The primary cause of myocardial infarction is the accumulation of plaque in the coronary arteries and the resulting blockage. When plaque accumulates in the coronary artery, the abnormal function of the blood vessels causes the heart to be unable to pump blood throughout the body because the electrical impulses have been blocked by the buildup of plaque. The resulting arrhythmia can lead to irregular heartbeat, dizziness, fainting spells, nausea, vomiting, weakness, abdominal pain, and fatigue. \end{question}

(3) What is the difference between an acute and a chronic heart attack? Is it better to get tested at one time or to keep having these tests done until you're diagnosed?

Answer: It's important to differentiate between what happens during the initial symptoms (e.g., chest pain), which may mimic a stroke or other condition, and the later effects that may include the following:

1. Short-Term Symptoms: In a stroke, the affected part of the brain is damaged and it begins to die off. Thereafter, symptoms such as headaches, muscle twitching, and feeling lightheaded come and go. In this situation, no treatment will help your symptom. However, if there is something wrong with the functioning of the heart system, the immediate symptoms will likely improve after some time has passed.

2. Chronic Heart Attack: A chronic heart attack occurs when the heart tissue stops working properly, so that the abnormal flow of blood through the body causes problems like high blood pressure, dizziness, fainting spells, numbness, confusion, or hallucinations. With prolonged treatment, many patients feel able to return to their normal lives with little or no ill effects from having had a heart attack. However, this type of heart disease does not usually progress into a full-blown heart attack, but rather progresses along a series of stages where it becomes more severe and is often followed by death.

If you develop chest pain while taking certain medications for diabetes, the most reliable way to tell if the medication is causing heart trouble is whether your patient reports having pains in his chest (hearing, fluttering, trembling, chest tightness, pain coming from below the neck) after drinking a large amount of alcohol. If he or she experiences similar sensations, then the medicine is probably not helping.

The best advice for anyone considering taking any kind of drug or supplement is to consult a physician who is experienced with drugs and supplements before beginning anything new.

gpt2-large_45,"Yes, all you need is simple lifestyle changes that will help prevent complications of type 1 diabetes (see also ""What Is Diabetes?""). This answer provides the most comprehensive overview available on this topic. A more extensive summary of the many factors affecting the course of diabetes can be found at http://www.diabetes.org/get_informed/resources/dietary_management.html

The following two questions provide additional information on the subject.

1) What should I do if I have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes? \nAnswer: The diagnosis of type 2 diabetes means you're prediabetic and are likely to develop complications in your life. To minimize any problems associated with diabetes, it's best to avoid high blood pressure and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. If you are prediabetic, your doctor may suggest lifestyle adjustments such as reducing sodium intake or eating less starch (sugar), increasing fiber, and consuming a lower calorie diet. In addition, some medications are known to increase insulin levels, which makes you more prone to developing hypoglycemia. You can get a list of diabetic drugs at http://www.diabetes.org/get_informed/medications/.

2) How long does type 2 diabetes last? Does it affect my ability to work? \nAnswer: Type 2 diabetes usually begins in early adulthood but usually occurs later on in life. Although it's not possible to predict when an individual will develop diabetes from their height or weight alone, many studies indicate there's no relationship between these variables and type 2 diabetes. Your body's metabolism tends to slow down during childhood and adolescence, making your chances of developing diabetes seem greater than they really are. For example, a person who weighs 135 pounds at age 10 years has a 5 percent chance of having type 2 diabetes by age 20 years; a 165-pound person at age 15 has only a 4 percent chance. However, if both parents are diabetics, this number rises to nearly 50 percent. For those who were born before 1978, however, the rate rises to 73 percent. Thus, diabetes is often seen at a very young age, after children start growing into healthy adults, suggesting that most individuals develop it earlier than expected. While it's important to stay active and eat properly until you've developed your own normal range of activity and weight, the sooner you can take steps to reduce diabetes risks, the better. Diabetics who exercise regularly lose weight because exercising raises glucose production in muscle tissue.

This pressure can be caused by any number of things such as a blow to your head, falling asleep while wearing sleepwear, or being hit in an accident. It usually goes away after a few days, but it could be something you have to deal with over time. If your head isn't causing problems, don't worry, just get some good sleep and everything will work itself out. If you do have trouble sleeping, try this simple remedy: take 5 minutes to lie down in bed for 20 minutes every night. When you come to, lay back down and relax your body so that you feel comfortable. Do not use pillows or blankets, because they are too soft. Try using a blanket or mattress instead.

Question: How can I keep my hair up?\nAnswer: You need to learn how to control your hair, whether it's curly, wavy, thick, thin, or fine. Many women find themselves struggling with their hair because they cannot seem to figure out what works best. Here are several ways to help: 1) Start by focusing on controlling your hair. For example, if you want short hair, start by pulling a comb through your hair at least twice a day. 2) Look for products that make your scalp more sensitive (e.g., silicones). These chemicals help protect your scalp from dryness during drying. 3) Stay away from shampoos or conditioners that contain harsh ingredients such as parabens, sulfates, or phthalates (which may also contribute to allergies). 4) Use moisturizers which provide moisture without added chemicals. Examples include coconut oil, jojoba oil, aloe vera gel, almond milk, apricot kernels, grape seed extract, rosehip seed oil, safflower oil, and avocado oils. 5) Take steps toward better sleep hygiene practices such as washing your hands before eating, showering, and dressing yourself. 6) Cut out the stress factor by taking frequent breaks throughout the day. 7) Practice good habits like exercising regularly, making healthy food choices, cleaning your home, getting enough rest, and avoiding stressors such as excessive noise, heavy traffic, stressful environments, bad weather, and unhealthy foods (eating too much sugar or candy may cause headaches). 8) Stop smoking! This habit can negatively affect your brain function, increase your risk of developing cancer, and contribute to many other diseases. 9) Avoid alcohol.

gpt2-large_126,"Birth control is often used for many reasons. The most important reason people choose to use contraception (such as condoms or hormonal pills) is that they want to prevent pregnancy. For this reason it's not uncommon for someone to be told by their doctor that they can't have a baby because of the risk that one will become infected with HIV. However, just like any other preventive medicine, such as blood pressure medication or cholesterol-lowering diet, there is no guarantee that using effective contraceptives will protect you from getting pregnant. It is generally safe for women under age 18 to use oral contraceptives if they follow all recommended guidelines and are taking them as directed. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that among 5,300 adults 25 years old and older who were trying to conceive, approximately 1 percent became pregnant when using effective methods of birth control. This means that 1 out of every 10 people who tried to get pregnant while on birth control had that pregnancy ended up being an unintended result. Although some factors contribute toward success, such as using good personal hygiene, there is no way to know what your chance of becoming pregnant is until after you've been able to have a child. Because birth control is usually taken at once each day, even small amounts of exposure can make a big difference in how long it takes before you're pregnant again, and whether you're still fertile.

How does birth control work?


Birth control hormones inhibit ovulation, preventing eggs from being released from your body and allowing sperm to fertilize a woman's egg. Fertility drugs also block sperm from making it through the fallopian tubes into her uterus. These drugs, known as reversible contraceptive options, must be taken every day for several weeks or months so that they do their job properly. They should be taken as soon as possible after unprotected sex without any delay in the morning or evening. If you need help deciding which kind of birth control is right for you, ask your healthcare provider for advice.


What types of birth control are available?


There are two main kinds of birth control medications — injectable or implantable, depending on the method. An injectable contraceptive makes its way directly into your vagina by injection. Once inside, the pill, patch or ring releases a shot containing hormones that prevent ovulation. Your health care provider will probably give you different doses of these medicines based on your individual needs. For example, you may receive an initial dose of the pill or patch before intercourse.

Many people have reported success with just two weeks of treatment. The goal for the homeopathic patient is to get comfortable and then use the remedy at any point during the treatment period. We encourage you to continue to consult with your physician as needed for guidance on which remedies work best together.

Q: When do I need to stop taking a prescription medicine? Complete Answer: The first rule of medicine is, ""Do no harm."" It's important to note here that many natural medicines (such as herbs, vitamins, amino acids, etc.) contain compounds called active ingredients that can interfere with the effectiveness of some medications, including antihistamines. This means that if you are taking something such as aspirin, don't take anything else to prevent or reduce your chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke. Your doctor may prescribe other options after consulting with your physician about whether one of these alternatives would benefit you. For instance, you could choose to drink less alcohol or eat healthier foods.

The FDA has classified many opioids as ""unsafe"" medications because they may adversely affect other organ systems (e.g., liver). If you're on these medications, ask your doctor whether you should stop taking them, especially if you experience kidney problems from long-term use. A patient who experiences symptoms such as thirst, increased urination, decreased appetite or changes in bowel habits while using long-term opioid therapy may need to stop taking the medication.

muscle spasms

difficulty with swallowing

tremors

dizziness

memory loss

loss of vision \nAs you age, these attacks may become more frequent and severe. You may also experience other neurologic issues such as paralysis and seizures. The best way to understand this condition is through its physical manifestations.\nAnswer:\nMS causes many of the same symptoms as relapsing MS. As your brain becomes damaged from repeated infections by viruses, bacteria, and fungi, it is no longer able to fight off these invaders. When an infection occurs, the immune system begins attacking your entire CNS.\nThis results in severe neurological changes which cause problems in thinking, memory, movement, balance, balance, coordination, language, and vision. For example, if MS attacks one area of your brain, it will affect other areas of your brain. Therefore, when someone with MS experiences another type of attack, they can have significant cognitive impairment. A person who is suffering from MS cannot walk without help, do simple tasks like putting on shoes or using a fork, or even keep track of time. If not for a skilled healthcare provider, people with MS would never be able to walk without help.\nIn addition, MS damages a person's ability to smell and taste, reduce the amount of urine they produce, and make them lose bowel control. In addition, MS affects the eyesight, hearing, motor skills, speech, balance, and coordination.\nTo treat MS, you must learn what exactly happens during the attacks.

However, most patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and to a lesser extent Crohn's disease, experience significant disability due to pain, stiffness, tiredness, cognitive impairment and emotional distress. While symptoms vary widely among RA patients, there are certain characteristics that appear to result in a greater likelihood of developing RA. These include: \pnumb\

Complete Answer: Fat stores were once thought to be confined to the liver - they're now known to be distributed throughout the entire body. Although it was believed that fat would only be stored around organs where we needed it most, recent studies have shown that fat can also be stored in multiple locations inside the body including muscle, cartilage, skin and other tissues. In addition to being stored under the skin, fat can also be found deep within the tissue. This means that fat storage can occur anywhere in the body, including on your belly button. The best way to protect yourself against fat storage in the stomach (the area closest to your waistline), is to avoid eating foods high in fat and calories. Many types of vegetables, fruit and low-fat dairy products should also be avoided. To learn more about how to determine whether certain types of fats are harmful, consult your doctor.

It is important to note that many people who have a low BMI (body mass index) already have metabolic problems and should not start exercising unless they want to lose weight or change their eating habits. Physical exercise helps prevent diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer by reducing fat cells, increasing muscle mass, lowering blood glucose levels, increasing energy, decreasing insulin resistance, and improving energy metabolism. The American Heart Association recommends at least 30 minutes per day of moderate aerobic activity for most adults aged 20 years and older and 60 minutes per day for children under age 6.\nComment: \r

Physical activity improves the quality of life and reduces cardiovascular illness risk. In fact, physical activity may be one of the best ways to decrease the risk of developing several chronic conditions linked to coronary artery disease such as hypertension, stroke, congestive heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, and obesity. Physical activity should also serve as an effective stress management tool because it increases cognitive functioning, enhances mood, raises self-esteem, and builds resilience to future events. This advice applies to both women and men and should apply particularly to those with chronic illnesses or other disabilities such as mental retardation and Alzheimer's disease. There are many factors beyond one's individual circumstances that influence one's level of physical activity. For example, young adults who are not active often have more severe health complications than do non-active individuals. People with impaired vision, hearing impairments, or physical handicaps should generally avoid physical activity, even if it does not interfere with work or school. The following table lists some of these factors. However, there are numerous other factors that determine whether someone engages in vigorous physical activity. For example, genetics plays a role in determining how much you can physically do or what kinds of activities might hurt you. Your own personal goals are also likely to affect your level of physical activity. For example, if you want to become ""fat"" but cannot physically tolerate carbohydrates, then you will probably have difficulty engaging in vigorous physical activity. If you want to get stronger but can't lift heavy objects or push yourself out of bed, then you may have trouble reaching your highest potential physical fitness level.

The cause of this condition is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune reaction. \nQuestion: What are the symptoms and signs of allergic rhinitis? Complete Answer: Rhinitis usually starts with itching for 10 days or more. The itch may become worse if you're not wearing any protective clothing. Your doctor will have instructions on how to treat your symptoms. \nQuestion: What is cold sores? Complete Answer: Cold sores are sores that develop around your nose or mouth when you get something irritating on your body. They are caused by bacteria. Most people who have these infections don't know they have them, so they can be difficult to see and treat because the infection spreads quickly through the mucous membranes between your lips and your eyes. This makes cold sores look like pimples. \nQuestion: How do I make sure my kid's school won't bully me? Complete Answer: When your child has had a hard time at school, ask him what his teachers think of him. Tell your teacher about his trouble making friends and talking with other kids. You may want to ask if he wants extra help or has been kicked out of class. Ask him why. \nQuestion: Can I tell you anything about my cat? Complete Answer: Cats are carnivorous animals, meaning they eat both mammals and birds. They also carry parasites called fleas that eat the blood of their prey. So it's important to keep cats away from your pets as much as possible. \nQuestion: Is there such thing as an ""allergy"" to sugar? Complete Answer: There is no such thing as an allergy to sugar or any food containing sugars. It is just a symptom of eating too many calories. Try avoiding sugary foods until you find out which ones really irritate you. \nQuestion: What is the best way to keep children safe at home while they play outside? Complete Answer: Children should wear long pants or shoes at all times. Keep pets inside indoors only when necessary. If you are unsure about the safety of a particular activity, talk with your pediatrician or family physician before taking part. \nQuestion: What does ""good"" mean to you?

The sooner treatments are started, the more likely you will see some results within a few months. However, there are many other factors that can affect how quickly treatment works and whether it helps or not. If you don't get treatment before you develop symptoms, they may get worse or even be permanent. Treatment will take longer if you don't try it early. It may also take several years (or decades) before you actually experience benefit from your MS treatment. And finally, the sooner you begin treatment, the less chance you'll experience side effects.

However, if you're interested in helping people find out more about their illness, here's a few things you might consider doing in addition to just listing everything that exists in the public domain. 1) Look up ""medical"" and try to remember which definitions of that word exist within each medical discipline -- e.g., can someone who has been treated by a doctor receive treatment at home? If so, then go ahead and use the definitions as defined by the American Medical Association. 2) Consider sending in questions via email, rather than using one of the mailing lists listed above. 3) Do you know whether your condition can be cured by herbs? 4) If you're looking for a specific kind of herbal remedy, read the label carefully -- it may contain many different plants and herbs that are used for different purposes. 5) If you've ever felt like your symptoms were getting worse after you ate certain foods, you probably shouldn't eat those foods anymore. 6) Consider buying a supplement; take one if necessary.

Questions About How Long Does Chronic Pain Last? A Short Summary

Q: What is chronic pain?

A: Many people believe chronic pain is something specific to one's body and/or a certain type of injury. In reality, many people feel both general and specific pain.

There are two main kinds of pain: non-specific and specific. Non-specific pain occurs during physical activities where there is little difficulty. Specific pain occurs when there is difficulty performing repetitive tasks, such as walking or lifting heavy objects. Sometimes non-specific pain is associated with nerve damage, while other times, it can occur independently.

Non-specific pain is typically temporary, lasting less than 6 weeks, whereas specific pain can last longer than 2 years, usually due to permanent structural damage, muscle atrophy, joint injuries, or cancer. Some cases of chronic",63,Will multiple sclerosis affect my career?,-0.0089205782860517,2,multimedqa,3,0.008,421,2

gpt2-large_54,"Multiple Sclerosis is an umbrella term that refers to at least 2 different kinds of progressive neurodegenerative diseases: Sjogren's syndrome (also called Lewy bodies disease) and demyelinating polyneuropathy. Both conditions can affect the nervous system and cause symptoms ranging from mild to severe, including memory loss and mental confusion, as well as muscle weakness and joint pain. Although they may appear similar, there are also many important differences between them. The most prominent difference involves how the disease progresses, and in which direction. Sjogren's is characterized by long periods of relatively slow and gradual degeneration of neurons in the brain stem; whereas, Demyelinating Polyneuropathy develops with nerve damage throughout the body, leading to chronic inflammation and disability.\n

Answer: \/PATTERN of question\nThe two terms are not interchangeable because they refer to distinct causes. A person who has progressive (remitting) Sjogren's may be able to lead normal lives but will often have long, persistent and debilitating neurological deficits. Conversely, someone whose primary disorder is Demyelinating Polyneuropathy, would likely experience disability and lifelong impairment regardless of whether he or she developed Sjogren's or a secondary autoimmune disorder (such as rheumatoid arthritis).

gpt2-large_52,"We have gathered data from over 12,000 Americans who participated in the 2012 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). In this survey, we asked respondents how many people in their household had experienced any mental illness during the past year and how often they experienced an episode of depression, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, substance abuse disorder, or suicidal ideation during that same time period. Of those with any mental disorders, more than 7% said they were diagnosed with an ""affective"" condition, while 2.4% reported having been treated for one such condition, 3.3% were prescribed medication by a doctor, and 1.8% reported treatment for another mental disorder.\nBased on these responses, the NHIS estimated that in 2011, 6.5 million adults—or 11.1% of all U.S. residents aged 18 years and older—experienced at least one mental illness in the previous year. About one in four (26%) adult Americans had experienced both symptoms of depression and schizophrenia in the preceding year.\nFor example, 9.2% of men and 4.7% of women reported being diagnosed with schizophrenia, and 5.0% of men and 2.6% of women had received treatment for either depressive disorder or schizophrenic disorder.\nOther popular questions included whether someone had ever felt like he or she was going crazy or if they'd seen someone commit suicide. The majority (62%) of people surveyed believed that no one has ever gone insane. Just under half (49%) thought it likely no one would ever kill himself or herself; 23.9% said it is possible for people to be ""cured"" through psychotherapy, and 14.4% said it is possible for them to experience ""the full effects"" of a major psychiatric diagnosis. Finally, a quarter of all respondents said they have heard of or used tranquilizers or sedatives. On a separate scale, 41% described themselves as being very concerned about the use of prescription medications, such as antidepressants or antihistamines. This concern has increased considerably since 2007, when only 38% of the population expressed this level of concern.\nThe results of the survey also reveal that approximately one in five adults reported experiencing at least one serious mental illness in the last year.

2. You are often overwhelmed by stressors such as financial difficulties, work stresses, and family problems.

3. When you have been unemployed for more than six months, you can be extremely hard on yourself and sometimes lose control over what is happening in your life.

4. You feel like there is something wrong with you and/or that you deserve to fail at everything that you do. \nOther symptoms include impulsivity, low self-esteem, hostility, and anxiety.

5. You may experience extreme mood swings from high to low levels and unpredictability.

6. People see you differently depending on how they perceive you. In particular, certain people may seem friendly, supportive, accepting, caring, and loving, whereas others may seem distant and dismissive.

7. You feel misunderstood and ignored and sometimes have difficulty trusting other people. This can happen both in the workplace and personal relationships.

8. Some days might seem great and others seem horrible. Sometimes it feels like everything goes perfectly, but then there's one day that seems so unkind and unforgiving that you get angry and want to punch them in the face.

9. For example, if you work long hours and are stressed out, you may become depressed. However, if you stop working, things can get back to normal pretty quickly. You may also be happy and relaxed, but then go home frustrated, cranky, angry, or bitter.

gpt2-large_85,"The number of relapses is directly related to the number of medications that have been taken during a specific period in time for treating the disease. In other words, if you take one medication every day, then your chances of relapse is very high. So as long as you do not use any new drugs or start taking them suddenly, this type of relapse can be controlled without additional therapy. (See section below on How Many Medications Can I Take?)

Answer : It depends on how many doses of medication you will need to take over a short period of time to treat symptoms of MS. You should never stop taking an existing medication until after you've had all or most of its effects. For example, if you're using a medicine called Tylenol that has been prescribed for MS, it may help prevent relapses. But if you want to prevent relapses by stopping treatment abruptly right before a relapse occurs, it's important to know whether your current drug regimen is likely to work when there is a relapse. That means comparing the effectiveness of the drug with another drug with similar properties. And be sure you understand that it's impossible to predict which combination of medicines might give the best results for everyone who takes it.

gpt2-large_123,"\n\nHypothyroidism is the most common of all thyroid disorders; it affects up to 4 percent of women in their 40s. It occurs when an individual's thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones to regulate body temperature and other bodily functions.\nQuestion: what causes hypo? Complete Answer:\n\nIn people who have not had a child before they reach age 35, a condition known as premenstrual syndrome (PMS) may result in low levels of estrogen and progesterone that can lead to fatigue and weight loss. The hypothalamus secretes two chemicals called gonadotropins; one, follicle stimulating hormone, stimulates the ovaries to release eggs into the fallopian tubes. The other hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), stimulates the uterus to become swollen with a lump. Symptoms of hypo include nausea, vomiting, headache, weight gain, dizziness, sweating, abdominal pain, mood swings, difficulty sleeping, and weakness.\nQuestion: how to treat my thyroid? Complete Answer:\n\nWhile treatments for hypo can vary widely depending on the exact cause of the disorder, generally there are three primary approaches: increasing thyroid function by taking medication; decreasing thyroid activity via diet or supplements; and eliminating thyroid hormones altogether. Each approach involves a different combination of drugs and therapies. Some medications used to decrease thyroid activity include: magnesium sulfate, albendazole, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Many dietary supplements also work to increase thyroid hormone levels. Other methods of treating hypo include: limiting food intake and exercising regularly; supplementing with iodine if your doctor tells you to; and taking an anti-thyroid drug like thiophanate-iodide or niacinamide.

If you have symptoms of either type, it is very likely that the cause is inattention rather than an underlying mental disorder. For example, a person with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may also suffer from mood changes such as depression or irritability. The most important thing to know about treating ADHD symptoms is that they can occur without any awareness of their severity. While many parents of children with ADHD report that their child's behavior does improve after taking medications for at least five years, others do not believe that medication treatment has made a difference. In fact, some people with ADHD even prefer not to take stimulants, claiming that they just don't work. It is difficult to determine whether this belief stems from a lack of scientific evidence or an unwillingness to listen to advice on how to treat their symptoms.

QUESTION: what should I know about glasses before I go into the hospital? \n\nAnswer: The following information is from the American Society of Anesthesiologists: ""The most important thing is that you have read and understood the following statements. They contain legal advice intended only for physicians licensed in your state and must be followed by all anesthetists and optometrists."" Read the statement carefully before you come to see the optometrist or an anesthesiologist.

""In some cases, patients who have had vision problems due to diabetes or cataracts will require special glasses because of their age and visual acuity. However, when evaluating these patients, it is essential that they understand the risks involved before obtaining glasses. With proper guidance and management, vision is likely to improve over time, although improvement can occur gradually even if the patient continues to receive treatment.""

gpt2-large_57,"The following is the general information on MS stages for women in the United States:


MS stage 1 - Mild disability (no symptoms)


MS stage 2 - Mild or moderate disability (symptoms are present but do not require treatment)


MS stage 3 - Severe disability (severe pain, swelling, and stiffness of muscles/joints)


MS stage 4 - Very severe disability (bleeding from joints, loss of muscle strength and range of motion, loss of vision and hearing)


If you want to find out more about this disease, we recommend that you seek expert advice from your doctor. Our website also contains information on treating MS.

Do I need an MRI? You may be asked to have a CT scan (computed tomography) performed at some time during your treatment program. These scans can reveal signs and symptoms of MS as well as help determine if there are any underlying disorders causing the condition. It's generally recommended that if your doctor does order a scan that it will take place within two weeks after beginning treatment (after six months you should expect to see improvement). However, many people have good results with regular checkups for several years without needing an MRI.


When would I start treatment with Cymbalta? If your primary care physician prescribes Cymbalta, he or she will prescribe starting you off slowly with low doses each week until you notice significant benefit. Your doctor could also suggest switching to higher dose Cymbalta when you begin experiencing serious side effects such as joint pain. After you reach 20 mg, most patients experience a gradual increase in dosage over several months. For example, once your baseline dose of 40 mg has been reached, 50 mg will gradually become a daily dose. At 10 mg, 150 mg becomes 200 mg. If you are taking Cymbalta in combination with other medications, ask your doctor about dosing adjustments. As mentioned above, there is no specific minimum dose of Cymbalta you must follow. If you feel discomfort using Cymbalta, don't use it. The amount you should consume depends on how much you're already taking and how far along you've progressed. Don't miss doses!

gpt2-large_86,"The second major form of MS is called secondary progressive multiples. This disease may be diagnosed in childhood or adulthood. It generally starts with symptoms similar to those of the first form of MS, but it progresses more rapidly than one would expect from its name. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis causes a progressive loss of muscle mass that can lead to paralysis within two years after onset. In addition to these symptoms, many people with primary progressive MS also experience fatigue, headache, joint pain, vision changes, weakness, and numbness in certain areas on their bodies. It is difficult to determine exactly what stage of MS has been detected as long as there are no significant impairments in activities other than walking (exercise). The cause of this progression remains unclear, although scientists have proposed several theories. These include: the immune system attacking nerves or muscles;

a bacterial infection of central nervous system tissue causing an inflammatory response;

an autoimmune reaction against one or more genes encoding for proteins that trigger immune cells into action;

a viral infection that causes T cell activation that leads to damage;

any number of reasons, none of which are specific enough to identify an exact cause for the disease. Treatment of secondary progressive multiples varies depending on the severity of the disability experienced by the person. Most persons treated will achieve some level of mobility. Some require assistance to walk, others need help climbing stairs, and still others use wheelchairs or other forms of assistive devices to facilitate movement. For most individuals who progress to the point where they experience functional limitations, treatment options vary greatly depending on the type of disability and whether the individual has an underlying condition such as diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Depending on the degree of impairment, some patients may not require any special care at all and may even recover completely without any intervention. Other patients may be able to walk only very slowly, requiring a variety of physical treatments. As with any patient whose MS has progressed to the point where he or she requires more intensive treatment, we recommend consulting your physician before deciding whether you should undergo therapy or receive medication for treatment of your MS. \r


What else should I know?

gpt2-large_93,"No. This question is commonly asked by consumers who have suffered from MS for some time. The answer given here is based on the information provided by the FDA, as well as research that has been done in the field of MS in both adults (CPSI) and children (ADNP). There is no scientific evidence that the sleep disturbances experienced by patients with MS are related to their MS symptoms. However, many individuals do report difficulty falling or staying asleep when they have MS. Sleep disorders can be either primary or secondary diseases, such as insomnia. It has been suggested that sleep deprivation may cause an increased risk of developing secondary sleep problems such as dementia or other neurological conditions. Therefore, it is important to determine if your condition affects your ability to fall or stay asleep. \nQuestion: What is the average age at which women first become pregnant?\nComplete Answer: Women of childbearing age typically begin having pregnancies around the time of age 25. In addition, although there are certain conditions that increase the likelihood of becoming pregnant during this period, these include pregnancy complications, diabetes, hypertension, and thyroid disease. At present, there is no established relationship between MS and advanced maternal age. \nQuestion: How long does it take for someone diagnosed with MS to be able to walk again after receiving treatment? Complete Answer: A person with MS must go through an extensive rehabilitation program before he or she is completely free of disability. While most people recover fairly quickly, other people need significant time to reintegrate back into society. Typically, however, the recovery process takes 10 years or more, depending upon severity of the injury. In addition, many individuals find that a second amputation, even a partial one, may result in additional physical difficulties. For these reasons, individuals seeking help should not hesitate to seek out a physician or rehabilitation specialist immediately. As mentioned earlier, there are also many studies indicating that there is no correlation between MS and Alzheimer's Disease. \nQuestion: I am living alone and will soon need to move into a home with a caregiver. Will my mobility be impaired because I live alone? Complete Answer: Unfortunately, yes. If you were born without arms and legs but your mother was married to someone else with them, then you would likely suffer from mild cerebral palsy, which generally means that you cannot move your hands and feet independently. In the event that your mother had two limbs or more, those limbs may or may not work.

This is true even though the drug companies have promised that it will help many patients who were previously treated with a medicine called SML (Sigma Aldrich). However, this new vaccine has been shown to cause serious side effects for some patients. The adverse reactions include increased heart rate, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, weakness, convulsions, headache, seizures, dizziness or lightheadedness, and sometimes death in these patients.[15] \r

What's more, the FDA is recommending that people be advised not to take the vaccines when they do not need them since the doses have changed from their original dosages.\n\nQuestion: I had my first Cervarix injection before Christmas 2007. The next day, I got the flu shot! Are there any benefits to getting the influenza vaccine if you already have the Cervarix virus infection and don't want to get the other vaccine? Complete Answer: You can catch one type of influenza A and B by doing two things: One is to get vaccinated against the H1N1 and H3N2 viruses; one is to get vaccinated against both strains of the H5N1 and H7N9 viruses. Both vaccines should prevent the disease but only the ones that target the same viruses might provide benefit. If you've had your own influenza infection you probably know what the symptoms of the flu look like. And if you're immune to the flu, then getting the flu vaccination may make your body more resistant to its attacks, which could protect you from catching another strain of the disease. But it's important to remember that both the Cervarix vaccine and the flu vaccine also contain live virus. That means they must be kept out of reach of children, pregnant women, and others who aren't yet fully protected. Just as important, those living with the flu shouldn't become sick while receiving either vaccine. It's best to wait until after the season ends before trying either vaccine. For example, some experts recommend waiting until April before attempting to get the flu vaccine so that the antibodies created in response to an infection in earlier months won't be lost. The H1N1 and H3N2 viruses are considered the most dangerous of the three because they are transmitted via respiratory droplets rather than through coughing or sneezing.

gpt2-large_79,"This is not possible because of the vast number of genetic differences between siblings that determine their susceptibility for MS. Even if two people share a few mutations in one of these genes, it does not mean they will develop MS together. If you have had MS before, your chances of developing MS after being exposed to the disease are low because there are very small numbers of those who have had the disease but do not experience symptoms at any time during their lives. The vast majority of MS patients are well-documented as having no history of the disease or who never developed the disease.\nQuestion: Why didn't my doctor tell me about the condition when he was treating me? Complete Answer: A lot of doctors don't know enough about the disease to treat appropriately. Most think that if you have been diagnosed with MS, then you must be suffering from it. However, this isn't true. People with MS can suffer from many different things including headaches, fatigue, weight gain, loss of vision, joint pain, muscle spasms, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, loss of memory, vision changes, rashes, weakness, depression, sleep disorders, anxiety, seizures, tics (spinning movements), hearing problems, and more. There are many factors that contribute to what you will experience following an attack such as how much damage has already occurred. For example, if your eye is damaged or infected then you may not react to light or sound. In addition, some people experience post-attack fatigue which can last up to six months or longer. You should seek help even if you're fine after the attack and feel normal again within a month. Also, many people have had attacks where they felt fine while others were sickened by the infection or eye injury and never recovered fully.\nQuestion: What causes MS? Complete Answer: It's difficult to say why someone develops MS, since so many factors are involved. Many people who believe that MS occurs due to some sort of immune system defect have tried to cure themselves through medication or surgery. Unfortunately, most people who attempt medicine fail. While the drugs that work on your body can cause side effects that you may not want, they usually don't have long lasting effects on your overall quality of life. The biggest factor contributing to MS is inflammation that results from the abnormal way your brain and nervous system function. You cannot control how your body functions naturally like breathing, eating, or sleeping. To combat this natural imbalance you need to balance out the inflammatory response in your body so that it doesn't lead to further",79,Can I pass multiple sclerosis to other family members?,-6.773416519165039,114,multimedqa,3,0.4978165938864629,433,15

For more information on smoking, see our ""Smoking"" page. \nQuestion: How does exposure to asbestos play into my MS? Complete Answer: Asbestos is one of several toxins found in many types of products used during manufacturing processes including electrical equipment, industrial machinery, plastics and other materials used for construction. These chemicals can be inhaled through dusts from contaminated air, water sources, and surfaces where they may enter the lungs. Some workers exposed to these substances report symptoms such as coughing up blood and difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle aches, headaches, nausea, and vomiting; others report little to no illness. It was reported that the rate of pulmonary fibrosis (fibrosis) among workers involved with building projects in Vietnam resulted from the use of asbestos fibers during cement production. In addition to possible health risks for workers exposed to some toxic compounds, asbestos also has a tendency to migrate out of mines where it was mined. Exposure to asbestos can also cause cancer when the material damages the lining of the lung. In the past few years, researchers have started investigating whether a link between asbestos exposure and lung cancer exists. Some of those scientists believe there could possibly be a connection between asbestos exposure and lung cancer since asbestos itself can damage the lining of the lungs.

It also refers to injuries caused by being struck repeatedly with objects such as baseball bats, fists, etc.\r

\nquestion: how much do I need to take before my asthma worsens? Complete Answer: The exact amount of medication you should take depends on your particular situation and the severity of your symptoms. If you suffer from severe asthma, then you may want to take more medication than usual. However, if your symptoms improve but you still experience some worsening (for example, when taking medications for severe depression), then you might consider reducing the dosage of your medication. Your doctor will help determine whether or not you need to reduce your dose of medication in order to prevent further damage to your body from the illness.\r

\nquestion: what causes cancer? Complete Answer: Certain chemicals found naturally in our bodies play an important role in helping us fight disease. These chemical reactions have been described as causing carcinogenesis - or the formation of abnormal cells in the body.\r

\nquestion: how long is a week? Complete Answer: Weeks are generally regarded as the length of time a human is able to tolerate and process food. To complicate matters, each person is born into their own schedule, and most people live around 12 weeks. The average American waits a little over 13 days between the end of the last menstrual period and the beginning of the next one. Thus, women who tend to get pregnant very early on usually wait only about nine months between having children.

\nQuestion: What is the best way for me to get rid of my white streaks?\nComplete Answer: White Bloating - Why Does It Happen When I Have White Slips? There are lots of reasons why someone may develop white streaks on their legs or arms after a long night out. Here's what you need to know: 1. The white spots usually occur when your body has been exposed to certain medications (such as pain medication, antibiotics, diuretics) 2. These medications can cause blood vessels in your skin and around them to become inflamed 3. Once an area has started getting inflamed, it will stay that way until something changes, such as taking anti-inflammatory drugs 4. Sometimes these blobs can be hard to remove because they are so large 5. Once removed, most of the whites may stick to the skin and cause more problems 6. In addition to being painful, these white areas can also create a lot of redness and irritation, which can make people feel very uncomfortable 7. If left untreated, white blotting marks can eventually lead to serious infections like gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, herpes, mumps, and other sexually transmitted diseases 8. Another reason some people experience these blots on their legs and arms is from sweating from the inside 9. In most cases, there isn't much you can do to prevent these blots, but there are a few things you can try 10. Try using a moisturizing cream or lotion with water or a good exfoliant before bed 11.

2. What are the signs of advanced or metastatic lung cancer?

Stage IV cancers generally begin to look like stages I or II cancers before progressing to stage III. However, advanced stages are sometimes called ""extent"" diseases since they continue to grow, and stage IV cancers often progress beyond what would be considered ""stage I."" As with any type of cancer, your doctor will prescribe a course of medications based on his or her diagnosis. For more information see our page on Cancer Drugs and Prescription Information. When treating an advanced lung cancer patient, you may notice that he/she is having difficulty breathing (breathing less than normal), has fatigue, is unable to eat normally, or changes in weight. These symptoms typically go away over time. If all these symptoms persist after 6 months, you should contact your healthcare professional immediately. This does not mean that the lung cancer has disappeared; it means that you've discovered a cause for which you can now take steps to prevent further spread. You'll find your healthcare professional by calling 1-800-959-7937.3. Is my doctor aware of my history of smoking?

Not necessarily. Lung cancer cases are growing rapidly, but the overall number of lung cancers continues to decrease.6. Why do some patients get better while others don't?

Lung cancer is different from other forms of cancer because it grows mainly within cells rather than spreading outwards as tumors do in most other types of cancer. The reason why some patients' tumors shrink while others don't is unknown.7. Do treatments work?

gpt2-large_101,"Heavy flare up of the lymphatic system (and/or lymph node) is caused by an increase in blood flow to the area. The lymphatic system works on a very basic principle called ""thickness"". When there is too much fluid, it can cause a blockage between two fluids. If this blockage causes irritation or discomfort, then you may be experiencing a heavy flare up of your lymphatic system. This is usually accompanied with inflammation of the tissues surrounding the blocked fluid. In some cases, this process will progress to more serious conditions such as leukopenia which means that excess fluid has been forced into the lungs. However, most people who experience heavy flare up of their lymphatic system do not have any signs or symptoms that could indicate the need for urgent attention from healthcare professionals. Some individuals may also suffer with other underlying diseases, including cancer, chronic fatigue syndrome and allergies.

The following is a list of common questions regarding fever, vomiting, excessive sweating, and unexplained bleeding. There are many different factors that contribute to these situations and they can range from simple viral infections through to life threatening illnesses. Your best bet is to contact your healthcare provider right away for advice when faced with these issues.

Fever is a sign of illness. Most often times, however, the reason for fever is unknown at first. This can make things difficult when attempting to diagnose the source of your problem and how to treat it appropriately. It's important to remember that each person reacts differently to certain triggers so it would be wise to consult with someone experienced in diagnosing illness. Many doctors are familiar with these various issues and are able to provide information to help determine what causes them and treatment options are available. A number of medications can assist with controlling both general and acute fevers and help prevent further complications. Other effective solutions include self-medication with anti-inflammatories, vitamins, herbs and herbal supplements.

If you've been drinking too many sodas or other sodas with added sugars, your body may be storing more potassium and converting it into excitotoxins like lactate and hydrogen ions (see page 5). It's best to start with water until your pH balance improves so you can drink alkaline drinks such as pure lemonade or fruit juice with no added sweeteners. You will notice that your urine pH will increase along with your sodium and calcium intakes, which is normal if you're consuming enough minerals. Once your electrolytes are balanced, eat more vegetables such as leafy greens, spinach, cabbage, carrots, celery, beet root, and parsley. These are rich sources of potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, and vitamin C. They are very low in calories and contain fiber, vitamins B1, B3, B6, folate, calcium, iron, and protein.

Complete Answer: ERT is used only by women who had their ovaries removed due to cancer treatment. HRT is used by men as well as women. There are some differences in side effects, safety, and results with each drug. For more information see https://www.cancerwomenshealth.org/topics/treatment/. \nQuestion: What are the risks of taking birth control pills? Complete Answer: They can lead to breast growth, abnormal uterine bleeding, and infertility. They also cause serious problems with blood clots. The risk of death from heart disease is extremely low. However, this depends on many factors including how long you continue using them and the type of pill you use. In general there has never been any evidence that birth control causes cancer. In addition, there have always been many other benefits of these medications that outweigh any possible risks. \nQuestion: Where should I get a prescription for hormones? Complete Answer: Go to www.emedicare.com and click ""What is My Medication"" and enter ""birth control"". You will receive a list of pharmacies in your area.

Complete Answer: No. Some people feel uncomfortable when they first start hormonal medication because their body is still adjusting to the change. This is normal.

Pregnancy Information

When you become pregnant, you should talk with your doctor before starting any medication. Your doctor will give you information about what to expect in terms of pregnancy symptoms and ways to prepare yourself for the arrival of your child. The following questions may help guide you through this process:

However, this does not mean that they will always experience good results. In fact, many women may need to use multiple methods for their entire cycles or even longer to achieve consistent effectiveness with any given method. As long as you make sure your body is receiving adequate amounts of hormones, which include the hormone progestin, it can take some time before all effects from any method of contraception become apparent. It is important that women who use hormonal contraceptives know when they reach their monthly peak periods so that they are ready if necessary during their next period. If you do notice that you are more likely to go through the phase where you don't ovulate (and therefore no sperm is produced), consider using a different method of contraception such as the Pill, patch, or ring. Questions \nQuestion: I am taking hormone replacement therapy for breast cancer. How long should my meds last? Complete Answer: There are a number of factors involved with hormone replacement therapy, including how well the medication is working for you, the length of time since your last dose, and whether you have had previous heart surgery, diabetes, high blood pressure, cysts on the uterus, fibroids, thyroid problems, etc. Generally speaking, your most effective treatments should generally last at least 3 months after stopping them. You might want to try the pill for the first 2 weeks of treatment. After that, you'll probably need to start looking for a new form of protection. While it is true that taking less than 1 mg of estrogen per day can cause hair loss, there isn't enough evidence to recommend taking less than 5 mcg of estradiol/day. Your doctor will also want to talk with you about other medications you may be taking. The best thing to do is find out what your body needs for proper function. Once you've made up your mind, you can adjust your dosage accordingly based on your condition. Remember, once your meds are off the market, you won't be able to buy them again unless you have a prescription for the brand name medication. Some people feel it's much better to get a free sample than pay the extra money for brand name pills. When choosing a brand name option, always consult with your doctor beforehand.

There may be several possible causes for coughing, such as allergies or a sore throat. You may also have a cold that is causing your coughing. Some other factors, like stress or an illness, can cause coughing. Sometimes it's due to poor breathing, but sometimes it's more complex than this. Your doctor should determine whether there is a clear and definite cause for your cough. When you've determined the cause for your cough, they'll usually prescribe some medication to treat it. As with any treatment, the effectiveness depends on how long you take the drug. In most cases, a prescription usually lasts from 2 to 4 weeks. If you're using the medication in a different way (such as by smoking cigarettes or taking other medicines), ask your doctor if he/she has prescribed a different form of the medicine. Ask your doctor what other medications he/she might be prescribing, too. Question: I suffer from migraine headaches every day. How do I stop them?\nAnswer: Migraine headache is a serious and debilitating condition caused by a blockage of the blood vessels in the brain. It occurs when a buildup of excess fluid builds up in certain parts of the skull. This pressure blocks the flow of blood into these areas. With repeated attacks, migraines can destroy life's most basic needs. Treatment for migraine includes medications that reduce the amount of blood flowing through the brain. Most people recover completely within 1 year after stopping the drugs. However, certain conditions, including multiple sclerosis, heart disease, diabetes, obesity and pregnancy can affect recovery. When deciding whether to continue treatment, see your doctor before stopping treatment. A good starting point is to start with one medication at first and gradually increase your dosage.

Migraine headache is often treated with medications, particularly those used for depression. Many times, these pills are taken in combination with antihistamines, which relieve pain and keep your body's immune system functioning normally. If you experience problems with your migraines, consult your physician before switching to another type of medication. If you notice side effects, such as drowsiness, restlessness, loss of appetite and changes in skin color, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

The symptoms you describe, which include dizziness, fatigue, muscle weakness, joint stiffness and pain, and fatigue, start from the day you were born.

You can make this diagnosis yourself if you find what you think is wrong with your body or brain. \nQuestion: What causes migraine headaches?\nAnswer: The cause of these headaches is unknown. Some people have migraines when they're trying to sleep, but that's not necessarily the case with most people who suffer from them. Most migraines can be attributed to changes in nerve signals called excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPs). These are chemical messengers sent across nerves to create electrical impulses that travel throughout the brain. When an electric current passes through the brain, EPs send a message to other parts of the brain.\nWhat causes migraines?\nAnswer: There are many factors at play that lead to migraines, including:

• Increased levels of stress

• Depletion of natural substances that stimulate serotonin production, which increases tension and pain

• Dose response errors due to genetics

• Hormonal imbalances that affect hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone

• Brain lesions

• Neuropsychiatric disorders

• Illness caused by medications

• Drug interactions

These reasons can all contribute to migraines, even though there's no evidence suggesting any one particular factor is responsible. Even so, doctors frequently ask patients to try different things before finding the right medication. That way they'll know if their headache is related to a specific drug. In some cases, using other medications may help ease symptoms. But there are no known cures for migraine headaches. This condition occurs because a part of your brain produces excess amounts of certain chemicals. If you don't respond to those medicines, your headache could return.

There are two types of MS that have similar symptoms (MS1 and MS2): the primary type is progressive and progressive and relapses frequently occur after remission. The secondary type is milder and has no relapses. Both forms share many similarities and some specific symptoms. For example, patients with MS1 often develop a painless or ""slight"" swelling of the leg and foot (hypotonia), and also sometimes have difficulty standing for long periods without assistance from crutches or other assistive devices. They may feel dizzy or faint. A significant reduction in muscle mass results in pain and fatigue. In addition, MS2 includes neuropathy, which can lead to paralysis or death if not treated promptly.\n\nQuestion: What are the most common causes of kidney stones?\nAnswer: Kidney stone formation occurs when calcium deposits build up on a small part of your kidneys at birth. This buildup blocks the flow of urine and makes it difficult for you to urinate. As you age, this calcium deposit builds and can become large enough to cause blockages and problems in daily functioning. You are more likely to experience one kind of kidney stone than another because each person's kidney naturally produces different amounts of these minerals. There are several factors that can influence whether you get a stone or not. These include: age; body weight; number of years since menopause; physical activity; intake of vitamins and minerals; alcohol consumption; drug use; family history; and smoking. Most people who get stones will stop getting them before too much trouble develops. If you develop any of the above conditions, ask your doctor for help right away.

4. Do I Have to Get A Referral Letter?

Most employers require the request for referral letter before an employee can begin working without an appointment. However, some employees (particularly those who already have some training) often qualify for no-obligation referrals.

If you want to use a no-obligation referral, you'll still need to discuss with your employer what kind of recommendation they might give you, but this doesn't necessarily mean that you must agree to participate in a program like the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's Web site. It also doesn't mean that your job won't suffer because you refuse to help out in the form of free research materials.

5. Can My Employer Offer Me An Appointment Without Having My Involvement In It?

Some organizations, including the U.S. Department of Defense and federal agencies, allow for a nonparticipating employee to arrange for his or her own appointments with potential new hires. You might want to consider offering yourself as part of this arrangement, but remember that you don't have to sign a contract or anything like that.

6. What Is The Right Way To Tell Someone Who Has Multiple Sclerosis About Your Condition?

Some people seem baffled by the question of whether it's appropriate to ask a friend or family member about MS -- or perhaps even why we would ask them. While many are genuinely surprised, there are two main reasons for asking this question:

First, most people with MS believe that friends and relatives who have the disease are likely to tell you about it, regardless of whether they know you personally. This can be especially true of people with whom you share a family history, such as parents or siblings. Since you never knew your parents or brother-in-law, and were unaware of anyone in particular with MS",62,"disclosing multiple sclerosis at work, how will colleagues react?",-0.1256657987833023,13,multimedqa,4,0.05909090909090909,421,8

Answer: Ketones are very similar in nature to fats. Both are derived from amino acids in the body. However, when you use ketone bodies like acetoacetate, you get an effect similar to that which occurs during exercise in muscles - you burn calories just as you would if you were running (or riding) on a bike. A similar result is obtained using beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). BHB helps you lose fat stores faster than any other way. In fact, if you give your liver enough BHB, it will convert them into ketones within minutes.\nWhen it comes to carbohydrates, ketosis has several advantages over sugar-based diets: You don't need to eat so much and stay in shape. All the carbs you consume are converted into ketones in the body. This means no more cravings for sweets!

A higher level of energy is required for each gram of carbohydrate consumed. This means your calorie deficit stays low, while your weight remains stable.


The ketogenic diet works great even if you've been eating regular ""empty"" foods all day long! Because it makes you feel fuller longer, you tend to stick with this type of diet throughout the week. So you'll never run out of food again, and your body won't crave junk food at night (which causes your waistline to become enlarged), making it easy to maintain healthy weight.

Another benefit of ketosis is that it actually improves your ability to regulate blood glucose levels, which affects both appetite and weight gain.

In addition, your ketones may help you lose unwanted fatty deposits that build up between cells in your skin. These deposits cause acne. If these fat deposits remain, they can lead to cancerous growths that damage cells and increase risk of heart disease.\nThis is why you should always wear a bandage over your swollen lip or mouth. If you do have acne, you should avoid alcohol and spicy foods.

To learn how to best utilize ketones, see the Ketotic Diet section below.

gpt2-large_131,"http://www.healthcenter.com/get-the-hc...-exercises/ Question: how to use the toilet before bed?\nAnswer: by using a stool to push down on the bottom of your bowel and then sitting up or lying down. This will help you to maintain your posture and allow you to be able to defecate without discomfort. In addition, this is recommended as it helps relieve constipation. You can also use a large spoon to help with any additional difficulty in passing stools. Another option would be to have someone else hold your hand while you pass stools. The only real issue to remember is that there may be some residual pain caused by the pressure from the stools. If it does occur, simply move into another position until you no longer experience such pain. A few extra minutes in bed could help prevent these problems. \nQuestion: what is the best way to clean my hands after eating?\nAnswer: Place one hand over one's mouth and gently suck the food out. It should not feel too rough. Then place the other hand under the tongue and repeat the process. Be sure to keep your fingers well away from your teeth. In most cases, if you have trouble digesting food because of the raw smell, then try to let it settle back into your stomach. If that doesn't work, then just give yourself an hour and eat something again. Finally, you can either swallow it whole or chew or spit it out. Sometimes the problem is due to bacteria being released during chewing. Most times when this occurs, it should take several days before you can stop the activity once the bacteria has settled. However, when the initial irritation has passed, you may feel much better within two weeks of getting rid of the bug. \nQuestion: How do I know which medications are safe for me? Are they all alike? Answer: The safest medication choice for anyone taking a daily medication is a nonprescription drug containing at least 30 micrograms of magnesium per pill (about five teaspoons). Since magnesium plays a role in energy levels, it's important that people who need to take an antidepressant dose be sure that their medication contains enough of the mineral. Many antidepressants contain only small amounts of magnesium as part of a complex combination of ingredients. Because of this, many people find it difficult to know whether their prescribed medications are high enough in magnesium to compensate for any potential negative side effects of the medications. Therefore, it's vital to consult your doctor prior to making any decisions",131,exercises for better posture,-11.622248649597168,44,multimedqa,4,0.5176470588235295,422,5
gpt2-large_121,"Ankylosing spondylitis (inflamed tendons or ligaments of the arm) is an inflammation of the connective tissue in your muscles and tendons. It can occur when there's a buildup of pus around your joint as well as when your body reacts to pain by producing inflammatory proteins called cytokines. The main types of inflammation you may be seeing include those that cause redness, swelling, tenderness, or muscle stiffness, which are symptoms of other conditions. Other causes of inflammation include injury, infection, stress, cold, heat, high altitude, and many medications for disorders such as diabetes. Ankylosing spondylitis occurs most often in people with arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. It doesn't affect everyone, but it is more likely if you have any one or more of these conditions: arthritic (paralysis)

rheumatic (damage from chronic friction to joints)

arthritis (tendon damage or ulceration)

kidney disease

lupus

infectious diseases.

What are the signs and symptoms? Ankylosing spondylitis usually appears over time, typically within a year or two after the initial symptom. However, sometimes the first symptoms aren't noticed until months later. They're also different depending on what type of inflammation is causing them. Some symptoms depend upon the location of the inflammation: Inflamed, inflamed tendon

Tender, swollen tendons and/or ligaments

Red or blistered skin and/or soft tissues

Pain that moves up into your shoulder

A throbbing or burning sensation in your lower back

The inflammation may be worse on days where your body makes certain chemicals known as prostaglandins. These chemicals bind to receptors in the nerves that control movement and help keep blood flowing throughout the body. This helps reduce pain during exercise and helps prevent injuries caused by repetitive strain injuries (RSIs).

When should I see my doctor? You should seek urgent treatment before you notice a change in your symptoms. Your doctor will perform tests to check for any underlying condition that might make things worse or worsen your symptoms. If you notice changes in the way your body responds to something you eat, drink, smoke, or touch — such as the feeling of pressure in your legs, arms, or face — you should see your doctor right away.

In general, people with dry skin should avoid tanning beds. People who have been diagnosed as having psoriasis or other skin conditions can try using an anti-fungal medication such as minoxidil (Zyrtec) daily for 3-7 days before attempting to bathe or shower. The best time for bathing is when you are most tired and stressed out so you can help eliminate bacteria that cause disease.

gpt2-large_94,"You can expect to notice improvement in your symptoms when you have started the therapy that is best for you. The time between starting treatment and getting relief from your condition depends on several factors, including: Your age

Your immune system status (e.g., antibody level)

The type of MS (autoimmune, autoimmune, or chronic)

Initiated therapy such as medications

Current medications used to treat MS

How long after initiation of an MS therapy does it last? How do you know how much time has passed since therapy began? Answer: Multiple Sclerosis may improve more quickly than other diseases, depending on your individual response to different types of therapies. For example, if you respond well to corticosteroids (an anti-inflammatory drug), the treatment might continue to help you for years. If you respond poorly to these drugs, however, a new regimen will be prescribed for at least three months while you undergo evaluation by your doctor. What is the average length of time between when you receive a diagnosis of MS and when you start receiving MS treatments? \nQuestion: Where do I go to get information about my disease? Complete Answer: You should check your local public library or call one of your local MS societies for information on current research. Also see our MS Center Web page. How often does the first symptom of MS appear? Answer: All people experience their first symptoms once they develop lesions on their brain. As time goes on, symptoms become increasingly severe and less frequent. Generally speaking, a person starts to feel sick soon after his/her initial appearance. In some cases, however, this early onset may not occur until later in life. After the initial appearance of the first symptom, the progression of the illness may take 2, 4, 8, 10 or even 12 weeks, but not necessarily longer. When will I begin to feel better? Answer: This varies greatly according to what disease you have. Some conditions (such as glaucoma) cause progressive loss of motor function. Others (including Alzheimer's disease) cause progressive deterioration of cognitive functions. The earliest you would probably notice any real improvement would depend on which of the two disorders you have. However, even in the case of glaucoma, it takes up to a year before symptoms really improve. Other forms of MS affect both eyes, such as optic neuritis. These conditions usually have very short recovery times, typically taking only 3 or 6 weeks, so there is no need to wait for the worst to happen!

gpt2-large_102,"Eczema is caused by the allergic reaction of skin cells that is triggered by bacteria or viruses. It's very common on children who eat foods containing food-borne pathogens such as eggs or nuts. If you get eczema from eating raw fruits or vegetables then it could be a sign of an allergy. Symptoms of an allergy include hives, swelling, redness, pain, red eyes, runny nose, swollen lymph nodes, wheezing, difficulty breathing, coughing up blood, vomiting, diarrhea, and sometimes even death. In addition, some people with eczema may experience anaphylactic shock when they inhale pollen in the air. The best thing to do if you suspect your child has eczema is to take him or her to the doctor right away. You can also use this information to guide you through the proper treatment for your child.

In general, the more severe symptoms you have, the less likely your child will be exposed to food-borne pathogens. When it comes to allergies, however, there is no one correct way to diagnose them. As adults we develop tolerance and sensitivity to certain allergens. This means that our bodies become less sensitive to specific allergens than at any other time in our lives; therefore, some of us have a greater potential risk of getting these kinds of allergies than others. Therefore, although it is important to know the type of reactions your child may be experiencing to avoid exposing yourself, it is not always necessary. For example, some people may react more strongly to foods because they were born with a predisposition to intolerance to particular proteins in food.

Sometimes when someone gets sick, he or she becomes hypersensitive to another substance in his or her body—such as something in the water in which he or she was swimming. Because this can occur suddenly and without warning, someone who has been hospitalized can't tell you how much hypersensitivity might be happening to him or her. While most people with hypersensitivity to chemicals or foreign substances have no symptoms, some cases can result in a life-threatening event. In those cases, doctors must determine whether the person should receive emergency care. In order to prevent this, keep things like swimming pools clean and change out of rags or swimsuits after you go swimming.

If you think your child has eczema, ask your pediatrician questions about the triggers that are causing the symptoms. Ask about your child's activities over the past few weeks, including the food he or she eats, what medications he or she",102,randomly gotten eczema,-0.8931287527084351,6,multimedqa,4,0.061224489795918366,418,4

Most accidents happen because you didn't read them properly. You should take extra care when making turns, especially if you drive on a highway. Make sure you have adequate space between yourself and other vehicles and pedestrians on the road. Also remember that motorized traffic is dangerous for everyone involved; it's important not to get distracted while behind the wheel. If your eyes start blinking too fast after several minutes, use your phone as a guide and slow down to a safe speed. Some children will experience this problem, but they can prevent it using safety seatbelts. See also: The Complete Health Care Guide

However, if you stop smoking, you may be able to reverse these effects with medical treatment. \nQuestion: What medications can help? Complete Answer: There are many available medicines that can help prevent relapse. You should discuss this question with your doctor because certain drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can worsen relapses. In addition, you might need to adjust or discontinue certain prescription medications. As with any medicine, follow your doctor's instructions carefully before taking any medication. Do not change your dose without consulting your physician. A list of all known medications and their contraindications is provided at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/.\nQuestion: How can I reduce my risk for developing Alzheimer's disease? Complete Answer: The best way to prevent developing AD is by making sure you stay physically active. Your risk for dementia increases when you become sedentary too often or consume more than three drinks per day. Some evidence suggests that getting enough physical activity reduces the risk of AD. People who do not get enough physical activity experience higher levels of plaque build up on brain tissue over time. Additionally, people who smoke tend to accumulate more plaques in the brain, which means they make even longer periods of relapses. Finally, it appears that those who exercise more often are less likely to develop AD. While there is no proven cause-and-effect relationship between exercising and decreasing the chance for developing AD, you can take steps now to ensure that you remain physically active. For example, get regular exercise, including walking, jogging, swimming, weight training, yoga, dance classes, pilates, acrobatics, martial arts, hiking, or running. Find out how to join groups like Runners Against Drunk Driving (RAAD). Also, keep a daily log of the number of miles you run every day. This will give you a better idea of whether you're staying active and at optimal health. \nQuestion: Why does my dog have so much plaque in his brain? Complete Answer: Dogs are susceptible to plaque buildup in their brains because their brains metabolize alcohol differently from humans'. They also seem to produce more of the chemical acetaldehyde during the drinking process. Studies have shown that dogs whose owners drink alcohol are more likely to develop AD.

Complete Answer:\nThe primary tumor type for thyroid cancer is adenocarcinoma.\nWhen someone becomes ill with a thyroid cancer, it's called an undiagnosed thyroid cancer. Some experts believe that up to 50% of people with thyroid cancers were not diagnosed until later in life. There are several reasons why people might develop an undiagnosed thyroid cancer, including: \nExposure to radiation from nuclear testing during World War II, which caused iodine deficiency

Genetic predisposition to thyroid cancer

Obesity (especially when accompanied by hyperthyroidism)

Alcohol abuse

Cancer treatments such as radiation therapy or surgery

Chemotherapy

Iodine supplementation

Infection The main risk factor for developing thyroid cancer is hereditary factors. A mutation on one gene may increase the chance of a person getting an undiagnosed case of thyroid cancer. A second genetic change that increases the risk of developing thyroid cancer is mutations in two genes, FOXP2 and SREBP1c. These two genes help regulate the production of thyroid hormones, but they also affect immune function.\nYour doctor may want to test your thyroid levels before trying treatment to see if these changes are related to the condition. If the tests show that you should receive thyroid medication, then your doctor may ask if you would like to start taking one. It's usually best to give each dose once a month. Your doctor may suggest starting at a lower dosage than usual based on how well you feel. If you're starting too high of a dose, you could end up losing more body fat than normal because less gland tissue produces thyroid hormone.

gpt2-large_55,"In most cases, you can stop taking MS medication entirely (as long as it is not harmful). There are several options for managing this condition. The first is called ""treatment with steroids"". This method of treatment has been recommended by many people because it works better than the other two methods (including placebo) in some patients. If you have an autoimmune disease or any serious illness that might affect your immune system such as HIV/AIDS or cancer, you may want to consider this option. After the steroid regimen stops working, you will be at risk of catching something from the drug. This could be anything from bacteria to viruses, or even cancer cells or tumors. You should not take drugs (other than those prescribed for you by your doctor), if you believe they are causing any side effects. It's very important for your doctor to tell you what is safe when trying to treat MS (including getting injections, using steroids, or administering immunosuppressive medications like corticosteroids and warfarin).\end_questions


Q: What do I need to know about my insurance policy before asking questions regarding my illness?

A: Before you ask questions, determine whether there is any benefit or risk associated with the treatment you're considering. Do you feel comfortable discussing your illnesses with someone else without first obtaining an official diagnosis from your primary care physician? For example, do you think you would be comfortable having a friend or relative discuss your symptoms with a family member or close friend without first doing an interview by yourself? Many people who experience MS feel more comfortable if they get their diagnoses directly from their physicians. However, if you don't already have a good understanding of your coverage, contact your state insurance agency or go online (www.nccareer.org/index.cfm) and look up the cost of your plan. A general rule of thumb is $1,500 for individuals and $3,000 for families. You must also make sure you understand all of the available benefits under each coverage type. Even though MS does sometimes require prescription drugs, you should pay for them out of pocket because there isn't enough money left over after deductibles, co-pays, and other charges. Don't forget about preventive services such as regular checkups, vaccinations, and blood work. These activities help prevent future illnesses from occurring. Also remember that your insurer typically pays 100% of costs related to long term disability or death. Finally, keep in mind that there are limitations to how much you can expect your doctor to cover",55,How to manage multiple sclerosis?,-0.0871977061033248,8,multimedqa,4,0.032520325203252036,416,9

Can I get a prescription?

Yes, prescriptions for over-the-counter medications are available in many pharmacies. In addition, many specialty drug stores sell prescription drugs and other supplies. If you go to one of these places, ask the pharmacist about obtaining a prescription from the FDA. Most pharmacies will charge a nominal fee--usually $3-$4 per month--for making the prescription. But if you prefer to do this yourself, there is an easy way to do so without going through the hassle of getting a prescription in the first place.\r

If you go to a pharmacy with prescription pads, you'll find that most have written instructions on how to write prescriptions, including identifying each ingredient. You won't need anything special for this, but some companies have extra pens or cartridges that you might want. See: Prescription Pens.


In addition to a set number of prescription pills, many pharmacies carry all kinds of vitamins and nutritional supplements. These are often sold in sets of two. They generally contain little more than salt, sugar, or caffeine. You don't need any additional supplies besides those listed above. However, some companies offer extras such as vitamins and minerals or dietary supplements. To check out which are around here, start by looking in your local grocery store's health department section. They typically sell the same stuff as your local pharmacy. \r

Many people with Type 2 Diabetes who have never had Type 1 Diabetes also develop it. Some people are able to prevent type 2 diabetes by eating healthy foods at an early age, taking medications as directed, or both. Learn more about the disease, how to prevent it, and ways to manage your condition.

Your risk for developing type 2 diabetes depends largely on your height and weight. Your body mass index (BMI) is usually calculated from your weight, height, age, gender, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity level, and use of medication. You should be aware that BMI increases when you get older and that your height may be less important than once thought because your height increases in relation to your weight. BMI categories: <18.5 18.5 – 24.9 25.0 – 29.9 30.0 – 34.9 35.0 – 39.9 40.0+ There are a lot of different types of diabetes which affect different groups of people differently. Your chances of developing diabetes depend greatly on your sex, age, diet, lifestyle, and genetics. For example, males are twice as likely to develop Type 2 Diabetes than females. And if you have two parents who each have Type 1, you're much more likely to develop Type 2 than if one parent has Type 2. Other differences include: The number of genes for Type 1 vs. Type 2 Diabetes. Men inherit up to 3x as many Type 1 genes from their mothers as they do from fathers. This means that only 50% of men will be diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes. Women inherit 4 times as many Type 1 genes from their mothers as they do from fathers. This means that 80% of women will be diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes. The amount of time that people spend sleeping.

Q: I have recently undergone surgery for an injury that occurred while lifting weights. Will I experience any long term side effects?

A: You will likely have a period of time where you feel like you need to take some breaks from training. Your body may not accept this as normal. This can last up to three months. During these times, it's important to try to focus on what you're doing. Don't let yourself think too much about the pain or lack of progress. Even after several weeks or months, you should still continue to exercise because it helps keep your muscles strong so they can move more effectively.

Q: Do you know if there are medications that can help reduce my symptoms or slow down their progression?

A: There aren't many medications available for treating MS. Some people find that",68,List of multiple sclerosis symptoms,-2.629652738571167,18,multimedqa,4,0.08144796380090498,342,8
gpt2-large_57,"I am the sole source for this information. The information below is based on my personal experiences in treating MS as well as others' opinions and experience. Please read carefully before you write an answer. \nQuestion 1. What is MS? \nAnswer 2.What is the difference between multiple sclerosis (MS) and multiple sclerosis complex (MSC)? \nQuestion 3. Is there any cure for MS? \nAnswer 4. Does MS affect women more than men? If yes, how much less likely do they have MS? A survey of MS patients by Dr. E.B. Trenholme found that men had significantly lower odds of being diagnosed with MS than did women. This was true regardless of age or gender. Women also had significantly higher odds of having been treated successfully for MS compared to men. A study published in the British Medical Journal found that patients who received a diagnosis of MS within three years of beginning treatment had a 75% chance of living with the disease for at least five years. Of those individuals who died, nearly half were under 40 years old. There have not yet been studies examining what factors contribute to the likelihood of dying from MS. However, it seems clear that the longer someone stays sick and the greater their pain, the lower their chances of surviving MS. There are several reasons why people may be more likely to die from MS: 1. The risk of death increases over time; 2. People with MS can develop chronic diseases such as cancer; 3. They take longer to recover than other people; and 4. Some treatments have known side effects that increase the likelihood of illness occurring. For example, medications that decrease immune response or interfere with hormone production, including corticosteroids, can cause inflammation in the body. The more inflammatory the conditions are, the greater the number of illnesses a person can expect to survive. The body's immune system has evolved to fight off infection. When the immune system is suppressed, it responds poorly to stressors that trigger an attack. This may result in multiple sclerosis. Therefore, an individual whose immune system is suppressed by medications may respond to symptoms and signs associated with MS without experiencing long term disability. Another factor in increased mortality among people with MS is alcohol use during periods of remission. In a 2006 study published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers reported that more than 20% of people who stopped drinking at some point after recovery from MS developed relapsing-remitting forms of the disease after returning to normal life. Additionally, research done in France found",57,multiple sclerosis stages phases,-12.679821968078612,157,multimedqa,4,0.7584541062801933,430,5

Complete Answer: For primary MS treatment you will require an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan to look at your entire brain, spine and spine and spine. You may also have scans of both the cerebellum (the part of your brain related to muscle movement) and spinal cord (including the nerve connections between these two parts). If these tests reveal any abnormal changes or if the results indicate potential neurological problems there is a possibility of further surgical intervention. In addition you may be asked for additional blood work. Your surgeon can arrange for blood testing after consultation with your primary care physician. There are many drugs that are available to treat progressive MS and other conditions.

gpt2-large_93,"It is unknown whether there exists any association between MS and sleep disorders in general or to other specific conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). However, it appears that the risk of developing CFS among MS patients with a history of insomnia has been observed in some studies [1]. In addition, one study found an increased prevalence of sleep disturbance symptoms in MS patients compared to those without MS [2], and another report indicated that cognitive impairment may be related to the occurrence of memory loss [3] (See ""Sleep Disorders,"" Section 8.1). Therefore, more research is needed to identify factors associated with the development of MS in patients who have not previously experienced sleep problems.

What do you mean by ""sleep disturbances?"" Your answer might be unexpected. What exactly is ""sleep disturbance""? I don't know, but I can tell you that for many years people were confused by what they thought was a simple condition called narcolepsy. We now understand that there are two kinds of narcoleptic attacks (NAs): nonnarcoleptic attacks (NABs) and narcoleptics (NPs), each characterized by different degrees of REM and NREM sleep deprivation. NABs typically involve excessive daytime sleepiness; however, if severe enough (and perhaps exacerbated by a physical illness or medication), NABs can cause serious psychological consequences. Narcoleptic attacks (NAs) usually last only a few minutes (or less) and generally occur during the middle stages of rapid eye movement sleep (REM). Most often, the attack occurs when REM sleep has ended and NREM sleep begins again. NPs tend to happen at night, especially in women, when REM sleep has stopped and normal wakeful periods return. These are extremely rare, so it's important to get regular sleep tests done and regularly monitor your sleep quality. Although the exact reasons why some patients develop NABS remain unclear, most research indicates that sleep changes due to depression or insomnia may play a role [4, 5]. There are also several theories regarding how narcolepsy may originate. One theory suggests that naps taken while awake can disrupt REM sleep, resulting in an abnormal transition from waking to sleep [6]. Another hypothesis states that napping leads to NPA activity, which causes a disruption in REM sleep leading to NABS [7]. Still others suggest that the inability to fall asleep during REM sleep contributes to the disorder and that napping makes naps harder to recover from [8].

\Nd\bV\cI\l I2A1 or type 1 or Type A: The most commonly observed form of asthmatic attack: The person experiences severe coughing attacks with wheezing, cough and shortness of breath, often for no obvious reason. This type of asthma can last from one day to several weeks. Symptoms may include difficulty breathing, chest tightness, gasping for breath, and shortness of breath.

Type 2 or type II: Severe or prolonged attacks that do not usually cause any symptoms such as wheeze, chest tightness, coughing or shortness of breath. These attacks occur less frequently but still sometimes lead to shortness of breath and/or chest discomfort.

Type III (abnormal) asthma, which has been called ""abnormal"" because it does not always result in acute illness. It also occurs more rarely than type I. During these events, sufferers may experience problems breathing, chest pain, or a feeling of fullness in their chests, throat, tongue or lungs. They may have difficulty swallowing or swallowing well, or they may feel lightheaded or dizzy. In some cases, the condition continues throughout life.

Symptoms of type 3 (abnormal) asthma include:

The inability to breathe when you breathe normally.

Chest pain.

Fever.

Shortness of breath.

Weakness in the arms and legs.

Swelling in the face and hands.

When to see a doctor

If you have symptoms that bother you or make you uncomfortable, talk to your doctor right away. Do not wait until you become too sick or injured to seek help. If you have experienced any kind of sudden onset asthma attack, call 911 immediately so emergency services can begin treatment. Call your doctor if your asthma worsens, including shortness of breath or heart palpitations; if you have trouble sleeping due to breathing difficulties; or if you have had a stroke.

Causes

Asthma is caused by a chemical reaction between inhaled particles and oxygen in the air. When there are large amounts of particles in the air, this triggers inflammation and makes people's breathing difficult and painful. However, other chemicals and disease processes can also trigger asthma attacks, including:

Question: What is the difference between primary and secondary prostate cancer? Is it possible to have both primary and secondary prostate cancer?\nAnswer: Primary prostate cancer is caused by growth of prostate cells within the prostate gland itself. Secondary prostate cancer is a rare form of prostate cancer which arises from abnormal tissue growth elsewhere in the body. The two forms of prostate cancer, however, are not necessarily related to one another. While it is true that there was once an association between these two different conditions, this has now been conclusively proven to be untrue. That being said, if you are concerned about whether or not your primary or secondary prostate cancer might be due to any abnormalities, it's important to consult your doctor before undergoing treatment with any medications or procedures. If this concern comes up, it's best to discuss the matter with your physician prior to starting any specific treatments, as they will likely provide an accurate diagnosis for you. Questions regarding the relationship between prostate cancer and other diseases should also be discussed with your doctor prior to making any changes to your medication regimen or to getting surgery. This is especially important when discussing the possibility of having a biopsy.

If you are having a flare, you may be able to use this information to help identify what type of leukocytes are present, how they affect your tumor, how long they last, and their frequency of appearance.

Question: How often do I need to visit my doctor? Complete Answer: No specific answer will be given for each individual patient, as there is no standard recommendation on when or if you should see your primary care physician. The recommendations are based on a number of factors including age, symptoms, and how well your overall health is doing. Your health, along with any past history, current medications, and general habits and lifestyle choices, determines whether or not you need to see your doctors regularly. For example, people who smoke are more likely than others to experience adverse effects from tobacco smoking and have higher risks of developing cancer. People who drink alcohol too much have lower rates of cancer and other diseases and may require fewer visits to the doctor. In addition, the incidence rate of cancers of the mouth, nose, throat, tongue, larynx, jaw, ear, esophagus, bladder, kidney, lung, breast, colon, rectum, stomach, pancreas, prostate, skin and reproductive organs increases as one ages, and the chances of any new cancer increase dramatically with advancing age. Although most Americans never go to the doctor regularly, many do. When you know why you might want to consult a doctor, your family physician, your pediatrician, or another health professional such as a dentist, you can begin to plan your next appointments. For many patients, getting good health advice has become especially important because many people with cancer face additional challenges during or after treatment.

gpt2-large_96,"A diet rich in fruits and vegetables is an excellent dietary choice for people with chronic health problems such as obesity. The recommended amount of daily fiber (4-6 cups) provided by fruit and vegetable consumption is at least one cup per day for every 2 to 3 pounds of body weight. For women, it should be no more than 1/2 cup per day and for men, 1 cup per day. Most studies have shown that consuming fruits and vegetables provides better nutrition compared to eating foods high in refined carbohydrates or protein. There is some research indicating that people who eat more fruit and vegetables also tend to live longer than those who do not eat these foods, but this has yet to be established. In addition, most of the published evidence suggests that eating whole grains may reduce their risk of certain cancers. \nQuestion: I am currently taking a combination pill containing both acetaminophen and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB). What is the proper dosage? Complete Answer: It depends on how long you take the medication. Do not take more than one pill at a time if you take it often or if you get headaches. Also, if you use this drug while you are pregnant, tell your doctor. If you feel ill, tell your doctor right away. Some other drugs like aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may be prescribed to treat mild pain during treatment with acetaminophen. Although there has been less research, there does not appear to be any increased risk of cancer after taking medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. However, there are many reports of patients developing side effects including liver damage. This can occur because some NSAIDs prevent stomach acid from being released. Your doctor will want to monitor your liver function before making any decisions regarding acetaminophen therapy for arthritis or other conditions. Do not stop taking medications without first talking to your doctor. Acetaminophen is classified as a Schedule IV narcotic drug under federal law. Many states regulate its use in accordance with their laws. If you need further information, call your local state's Drug Enforcement Administration office.

Answer: The cause of this condition is not known. However, some parents believe that this is related to certain foods in their children's diet. If your child has an eating disorder, you may want to consult a doctor or nurse before making any changes in their diet.\nQuestion: What happens if I feed my child too much milk? Answer: Milk is often considered an ideal food for babies. When you first give your baby milk, you should be careful to make sure he/she has enough calcium. Calcium, as well as vitamin D, is required for healthy growth and development. You may need to increase the amount of calcium given, but you must do so slowly to avoid causing nutrient deficiencies. Most people prefer to drink only water when they start feeding their infants. This helps them get more nutrients from the infant formula they consume. After two weeks of regular breast milk consumption, most children will become accustomed to drinking breast milk (not formula) from time to time. If you want to use formula, you should always provide your baby with the same quantity of breast milk every day, regardless of how often you fed him/her. Do not allow your infant to become ""fed"" on solid foods. Even if your infant eats a little bit of solid food each time you visit him/her, you should never force her to eat solid foods. This is especially true after a meal, because solid foods contain protein and fat which are important for proper growth. Keep in mind, however, that there is no scientific evidence that infant formulas contain less than what is found in breast milk. In fact, research shows that breast milk contains more of these nutrients, and a baby who drinks cow's milk may develop different developmental disorders as a result. Breast milk also contains a higher percentage of essential fatty acids, vitamins A, E, B6, B12, D and K, magnesium, potassium, and zinc. This information does not take into account the addition of synthetic ingredients. For example, soybean oil may increase the level of sodium in breast milk, while whey protein increases calcium intake. Be aware of all of the differences between breast milk and formula!

Question: I'm in my 60s, but still overweight. Is there anything I should do to keep myself healthier? Complete Answer: Unfortunately, no. The most effective treatment for weight loss is losing weight. There's nothing you can do about whether you're still fat or not, only about the amount of weight you lose. For example, if you were 10 pounds heavier and eating 3 pounds less each day, you'd be looking at around a 5% reduction in your waist size - that means that you could still drop five pounds without sacrificing much of your height, because you're actually losing 1/3 of your body mass. You can also achieve a smaller waistline by having sex less often - your metabolism slows down when you're sexually active. And by cutting out all fatty foods (fish, red meat, dairy products) from your diet, you'll feel fuller longer and lose a lot more weight. This is why even people who are currently normal weight have had very positive results following lifestyle changes like quitting smoking, eating better, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and so forth. In fact, in some countries people who quit smoking and followed their recommendations for several years ended up being fatter than they started! So while it may seem as though we've learned everything we know about obesity since the days of John Hughes, nothing could be further from the truth.

gpt2-large_126,"The effectiveness of hormonal contraception is highly variable between patients (approximately 20% efficacy). It should be noted that some individuals may experience increased risk for venous thromboembolism with use of the pill compared to other forms of contraceptive medication or hormone replacement therapy. This risk varies depending on individual characteristics, including age, race/ethnicity, and parity (i.e., whether the woman has had children). Although it can reduce the risk of blood clots in women who are at high risk (i.e., those with pre-existing cardiac disease), the benefits from using hormonal contraceptives have not been well studied for this population. Furthermore, the relative risks of venous thrombosis in men who use hormonal methods, such as intrauterine devices (IUDs) and diaphragms, and female partners of male users were greater than among the general population. Therefore, information provided by women regarding adverse events following use of hormonal contraceptives is important because there is no safe level of exposure to these products. Based on the available research, no adverse effects have been demonstrated associated with long-term use of hormonal contraceptives; however, it is important to inform women about the risks associated with prolonged use and the potential benefits of stopping.

The cause is not known for sure but has been linked with several factors, including genetics, environmental exposures, obesity, inflammation, and chronic illnesses. There are multiple types of asthma that range in severity and the most serious types can be fatal; however, the majority of these cases do not require medical attention. The best way to diagnose your condition is through an objective test, which includes blood tests and allergy testing. If you have suspected or documented asthma, seek treatment immediately. If you are at risk for developing asthma, it's important to obtain periodic medical evaluation. Call a doctor or visit a local emergency room if you suspect that you might develop asthma.

The American Lung Association recommends that people use their own judgment when deciding whether to take asthma medicines for relief, particularly if taking medication could pose risks. Most doctors recommend against using prescription medications to treat asthma because of potential side effects (see below), but some doctors also advise patients to try alternative medicine treatments. Some natural products that contain ingredients similar to those found in over-the-counter drugs may offer benefits over traditional inhalers, depending on how often you're exposed to them. For example, tea tree oil, cinnamon bark extract, vitamin E, and fenugreek leaf extract may help reduce the severity of symptoms of asthma, while coffee contains anthocyanins -- naturally occurring compounds that may slow the development of asthma. In addition, supplements may be beneficial if used regularly. These supplements should be taken only under the supervision of a healthcare provider who understands the proper dosages and dosing methods, according to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA). Your doctor will monitor your progress carefully so that you don't experience any adverse reactions after starting any type of supplement therapy.

Symptoms of Asthma Common symptoms of asthma include wheezing or coughing followed by shortness of breath and chest pain and urgency to breathe, although they can be caused by many different things including stress or allergies, infection, or other conditions, such as high blood pressure.

\r QUESTION: How can I find out how much time I need to lose before my heart attack? Is there anything else that I should be doing for my heart? Answer: This is a very simple question! Most people who are concerned with their health do not worry as much about how many minutes they spend on the treadmill (or other exercise equipment) per day as they would like to think; however, some people just want to know how long they must work to shed any excess pounds before they experience serious signs of aging. Unfortunately, it takes about 30 hours to build up 15 pounds of fat; thus, it is easy to overwork and fail to meet your fitness goals. However, if you know what you are looking for, there are several things you can do to help you reach your goal:\nFirst, keep your diet simple. Start small and build slowly; this will reduce the likelihood of overeating while at the same time reducing the chance of developing chronic diseases like hypertension or type II diabetes.\nSecond, learn to recognize when you are getting old.

Question: How much do I need to travel for my surgery?


Answer: Travel for your first surgery will vary based on whether it's done under general anesthesia or in an operating room. You can find out where each hospital is located by searching the National Practitioner Data Bank's database for your state. Most hospitals also provide their own websites or refer you to another website if they don't appear there.


The best advice we could give you to determine how long it might take to arrive home depends upon what type of surgery you're considering (see below).


If you are planning to receive a brain tumor surgery, your estimated recovery time after surgery depends primarily on whether your surgeon recommends the use of an epidural anaesthetic (which means you won't feel anything during or immediately following the surgery). In most cases, this procedure requires no more than one day. And, if you plan on undergoing an orthopedic operation to repair broken bones or joint problems, expect a shorter recovery time -- approximately two days to two weeks. For example, in one study of patients with broken bones that required an open fracture, half had a recovery time of less than 24 hours and half had a recovery time of 30 days or longer.


For non-invasive procedures such as cosmetic breast surgery, a minimum of two days is generally recommended; in some situations, up to six days is typical (for example, the surgeon may decide to proceed with the surgery if the patient feels unwell after just two days).

How long does it usually take to recover from an eye operation after using topical anesthesia?


Many people believe that overnight is too short a window when it comes to recovering from an eye operation.

Treatment Information

Q1) How long will I be able to expect my treatment? Can you give me specific dates and times? A1) Currently, most patients undergoing chemotherapy have their treatment scheduled between two weeks and six months after diagnosis. However, there are some patients who require longer treatment periods than that as they progress along their disease path. It has been estimated that over 25% of all cases of triple negative breast cancer are treated for up to 8 years. Q2) What would happen if I were to develop a new form of cancer during my treatment? This could occur because of genetic changes or because of the use of hormone therapy. In such cases, it is very important that we know what kind of changes are occurring in order to make informed decisions regarding treatment options. Q3) Will I be taking any medications while receiving my treatment? Most patients are encouraged to take some medication during the course of their treatment but it should always be kept to a minimum to ensure the best possible quality of life. Q4) Do I need to stay on hormonal treatment for a year? No. Although the effects of these drugs can linger for quite some time, the majority of patients will only need to maintain them for 2-6 months per year until they begin to decline. This includes hormone replacement therapy, which should be discontinued when the patient no longer needs it. Q5) I am not yet diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer. Are there any other types of cancers that can be reversed by using hormones? Yes. Patients with ovarian, uterine and kidney cancer can also receive hormonal therapy so long as they continue to follow the regimen recommended by their doctor. There are currently no studies showing that hormone therapy reverses lymphoma. Q6) What if I do not wish to take estrogen or testosterone during my treatment?

gpt2-large_77,"There is no one ""simple"" answer. Symptoms vary from person to person, and may be affected by the type of MS being treated, age at onset, and other factors. Menopause symptoms can also affect your overall health in other ways as well. Women with MS usually experience fatigue, loss of appetite, mood changes (such as depression), or headaches that often get worse during their menstrual cycles. For women with mild to moderate MS, symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats may occur every few months, but they typically don't last more than a week or two. These symptoms may change over time and are not always related to MS. The most likely cause of these specific symptoms is that they are caused by stress and have nothing to do with MS. Some women with MS may even suffer from other symptoms such as joint pain or rashes that get worse during menstruation. In general, it's best to avoid eating foods high in sugar or refined carbohydrates throughout your period so you won't gain weight due to your monthly cycle. If you feel an increase in fatigue and/or headaches in your periods, take steps to help manage your symptoms. Try using the following tips if you notice any signs of worsening MS symptoms: • Reduce the amount of caffeine you consume. This helps prevent weight gain through dehydration.

• Limit alcohol intake. Drinking too much may worsen conditions associated with MS, including headaches.

• Avoid spicy foods. You might find this helps relieve symptoms of MS.

• Choose healthy food options, especially vegetables and fruits. Foods like dark leafy green vegetables, nuts, seeds, fruit, legumes, beans and soy products are good choices for people with MS. Many research studies suggest that consuming more fiber, folate, potassium, magnesium, and vitamin B12 can improve symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats. However, there isn't evidence to support dietary recommendations based on specific nutritional needs for people with MS. To learn more about the benefits of eating a variety of nutritious foods, see our article on how to eat better with MS. Question: What diseases do I need to pay attention to when considering treatment for my MS? Complete Answer: It depends upon which disease you're interested in treating.

For more information on what causes a person to develop a certain type of chronic illness (and how long someone has lived with that condition), see ""Types of Chronic Illnesses"" below.

A person with a type of chronic illness (or multiple types) may experience symptoms at different times throughout their lifetime. It would be wise to talk to your doctor if you're concerned that the onset of new types of chronic illnesses is occurring at any particular time in your life. The following list includes some common chronic conditions:

Diabetes - This common disease is caused by high blood glucose levels. There are several types of diabetes, including Type 1 and Type 2. When insulin isn't enough to control blood glucose levels, blood sugar spikes. Symptoms include sudden weight loss, difficulty exercising, unexplained fatigue, lack of appetite, blurred vision, and sometimes hallucinations, seizures, or coma. You'll likely notice these changes first in your twenties. Diabetes also occurs when your body produces too little insulin (insulin is produced naturally in cells) after meals because carbohydrates aren't absorbed properly into the bloodstream during digestion. Many people have no obvious signs or symptoms of this disorder until they start eating refined carbs and sugars like white bread, sweets, chips, potatoes, pasta, rice, and sweetened beverages like soda. If you're overweight, don't eat so much junk food, drink lots of water, avoid drinking alcohol or taking drugs, and exercise regularly, you probably won't have problems with diabetes. Learn more about diabetes here.

Heart Disease - Heart disease results from heart attacks or strokes. While heart attack victims typically suffer severe pain, shortness of breath, chest pains, and nausea, patients suffering from the disease often have trouble walking or even standing up without assistance. Heart disease may cause heart failure and death due to blockages in the arteries leading from the lungs to the heart muscle. Some forms of this disease are preventable - for example, if patients eat right and get regular physical activity. But if you've already had heart surgery, don't assume that heart disease will go away on its own. For more details on heart disease, check out Heart",1,What are the most common chronic diseases?

There is an article on your site entitled ""Wisdom Teeth Removal"" (http://www.whomishelp.com/wisdom_teeth/) which provides more information than I can explain here. The answer below provides some background information that will help you make informed decisions when choosing between two similar dental procedures. A recent study was done by Dr. Martin Berkowitz, MD, and his colleagues, who found that one of the most common causes of severe gum disease is the removal of hard enamel with the use of a wisdom tooth extractor. This procedure removes the entire tooth and results in a permanent dentin layer. The root canal is then done to remove any remaining bone marrow or other debris from the affected area. It should be noted that there is no evidence of tooth loss after the procedure. The research was done on over 1,000 patients who had undergone at least one wisdom tooth extraction. Although the researchers were unable to conclude anything definitive about its efficacy, they did find that the wisdom teeth extracted reduced symptoms such as pain, swelling, gingivitis and periodontal infections. They also found that the wisdom teeth removed showed improved general oral health, but these improvements did not last long enough to eliminate the need for a second wisdom tooth extraction. In summary, the results suggested that the wisdom tooth extractor was effective in reducing gum disease; however, if you choose to go ahead with the surgery, it is important to note that the technique does have drawbacks; however, they do seem minor in comparison to those of the conventional wisdom tooth extraction. \end quote}

So how many times have you seen someone say something like ""I've never heard of a prescription for a wisdom tooth extractor""? Well, let's take a look at the facts to see what we're talking about...

What is a Wisdom Tooth Extractor?

A wisdom tooth extractor is simply another way of removing a hard enamel layer with a combination of techniques. When all else fails, a traditional wisdom tooth extraction may result in decay. However, the effectiveness of a wisdom tooth extractor depends upon several factors. First of all, there must be some type of base material underneath the hardened enamel layer -- otherwise, there would be no point in extracting it. Secondly, the extraction method must provide sufficient pressure to maintain the integrity of the hardened enamel layer. And finally, if the extraction is performed correctly, there is usually a significant amount of",105,wisdom tooth cuts gum pain,-1.6349672079086304,4,multimedqa,5,0.05063291139240506,418,26

Question: Should I wear my glasses while working? \nAnswer: All Americans should be required to wear them whenever they enter and leave buildings or facilities. However, it is not necessary to wear corrective lenses during daily activities when you are performing routine tasks, such as loading and unloading vehicles. This applies to both workers who operate heavy equipment and those who carry heavy loads on their shoulders. You are also allowed to use eyeglasses in certain situations under special circumstances that require them. For example, you can do so while operating heavy machinery and driving motorcycles. To protect yourself from damage caused by debris, dust, airborne particles, heat, rain, high winds, and even static electricity, it is recommended that you wear a safety vest, protective clothing, eye protection, and gloves and appropriate footwear. The wearing of the proper earplugs is strongly encouraged. Questions: What types of materials make up a computer monitor? Does your employer use monitors manufactured by Sharp, Dell, Gateway, HP, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Seiko, Panasonic, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, Philips, NEC, Intuos, Sanyo, and others? Complete Answer: Your employer uses either screens made from LCD monitors or displays. Each type offers advantages and disadvantages depending upon its characteristics and application. They include: LCD Screens: These screens usually provide excellent color reproduction and contrast.

Pros: Wide viewing angles and viewing distance increase efficiency of images displayed on these panels.

Cons: Low resolution, low brightness, poor contrast and color accuracy.

The reason is that carbohydrates can increase blood sugar levels above normal, causing an acute rise of insulin. This raises blood sugar levels more rapidly than they would be without this effect. It is therefore important for you to remain as glucose tolerant as possible until your body has developed a tolerance to the effects of carbs on blood sugar. In addition, since many drugs do affect glucose levels, any drug may interact with carb restriction in some way. Therefore, your doctor will advise whether a diet high in fat and low in protein will be best suited to your situation. However, even if no medication seems appropriate or safe for your particular circumstances, the following advice applies: \nIf you are diabetic and your blood sugar goes up by 3% after eating 5g of carbs and then by 2% within 45 minutes, you should try and reduce the amount of food eaten.\n

Your physician can tell you what foods contain the most carbs, how much each of them should count towards your daily intake, and which ones have been shown to raise blood sugar when added to the diet. Keep track of these meals throughout the day. This will help ensure that you get enough nutrients while at the same time reducing carbs to where they won't cause your blood sugar level to go higher than necessary.\n\nQuestion: What kind of fats do I need to keep my body happy?\n\nAnswer: You need polyunsaturated oils, such as palm oil, coconut oil, olive oil, canola oil and soybean and corn oils. They provide essential fatty acids that keep your cells running smoothly and your heart healthy. \nQuestion: How long does it take me to gain back lost weight from a ketogenic diet?\n\nAnswer: Over time, there are many factors that influence a person's ability to maintain a healthy weight. Some examples include age, sex, height, genetics, physical activity and nutritional status. To make matters worse, the number of calories burned during exercise also influences your waistline. As your waistlines get wider over time, you need more energy to support the growth of muscle mass. When a diet becomes too restrictive, this puts extra strain on your metabolism, leading to increased calorie requirements, decreased overall fitness, and lower performance.\nQuestion: How effective is a",35,Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?,-1.3075917959213257,11,multimedqa,5,0.07096774193548387,404,18

Complete Answer: For one thing, you need to have good balance and flexibility to move around quickly and easily. Also, your child needs to be able to use his/her hands to keep themselves warm when exercising. However, as long as they stay within their body's limits (no more than 30 minutes), there is no reason to stop exercising entirely. In fact, exercise should always be part of any healthy diet. Another key benefit to exercise is that it may help with reducing stress levels and anxiety. \nQuestion: what if my child falls down during exercise or gets hurt? Complete Answer: First of all, don't worry--you're not alone. Your son or daughter will recover quickly. If you think your child might need medical attention, call 911 immediately!

It's also wise to carry some clothing to change into on the trail, such as rain pants or a warm pair of hiking boots. Finally, make sure to leave plenty of room between you and your surroundings.\nQuestion: How much does yoga cost? Complete Answer: Yoga starts at $40 per hour and includes a variety of activities including tai chi, kundalini yoga, tantric yoga, and breathing meditation.

The only correct choice is between options. What's important here is that you choose wisely based on your own personal preferences (as opposed to what someone else suggests). For example, if you don't want your face shaved, then use a beard, moustache, or beard brush instead, as explained later. If you don't have any preference at all, then simply do not shave. However, if you've been looking forward to having your face shaved and now find yourself wanting one, then try this simple trick to get it done without too much pain! Take some shaving cream, put a few drops under a small hole in your nose, and blow gently through the opening while pulling back, so that the cream flows out through the hole into the nostril (this will leave less residue when you clean up afterwards). This way the razor cuts right into your skin (without damaging sensitive areas like the eyelids), but still leaves enough of a cushioning effect for the razor to glide smoothly over your face. It may take time to figure out exactly which solution works best for you. You should also make sure that the area you're trying to cover is covered before starting your first shave. When you get home from school, go ahead and put on a pair of gloves so that you're comfortable working with shaving creams, so that you'll be able to apply them well even after the cut has healed. Once the foam block is fully saturated, remove the block from the sink, rinse thoroughly, and pat dry thoroughly using a towel. You may need to hold your hand over the foam so that it doesn't slip off during the cutting process. Do not attempt to perform this step if you suspect that you may have swallowed something. Your doctor might give you a prescription for an antiseptic gel, but that's really not necessary since you can easily get that stuff at most pharmacies and drugstores. Use a soft cloth to rub the foam block against your face until it becomes coated with a thin film of shaving foam. Then, slowly but surely, begin to massage the area with gentle, controlled pressure, using the foam to prevent lather from accumulating on top of the foam.

Your physician can advise you on appropriate therapies based on his or her clinical experience and training in medicine. Your treatments may also be changed if they don't work as well as expected or if side effects become problematic.\nQuestion: My insurance company refused to cover my MRSA vaccine. Is this true? Complete Answer: Yes. Most insurers will not pay for a single-dose vaccination against the bacteria that causes methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) unless it is accompanied by another medication that reduces the risk of infection. However, this situation has changed recently with the emergence of multi-antibiotic strategies such as metronidazole, which includes several other antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, vancomycin, or tetracycline.

It is important that children receive both vaccines as soon as possible because a weakened immune system leads to an increased chance of catching the flu during the first year of life.

The information below will help you decide which medication may work best for you in terms of side effects. You should also keep in mind that other factors may play a role as well, such as allergies, blood sugar levels, and medications taken by yourself or under the supervision of an experienced healthcare professional. The following list provides general guidelines on how to properly prescribe your specific medicine(s).\n Question: What is the best way to prevent cancer? Complete Answer: The safest course of action is to avoid smoking, drinking alcohol, using illicit drugs, and taking other harmful habits. Tobacco use will kill approximately 80% of people who start smoking. Drink less than two drinks per day, so that you don't become dehydrated from overconsumption. If you smoke, quit!

Drink one to three glasses of water a day. Avoid alcoholic beverages completely unless they come with a ""no-tobacco"" warning label. Alcohol causes more damage to the liver than any other toxin. Drinking alcohol increases heart rate and respiration rates, which can cause problems for those at risk for diabetes. In addition, alcohol stimulates the release of growth hormone, which has been shown to increase the chance of developing prostate cancer. In addition, the increased appetite caused by alcohol can result in overeating and weight gain. \NQuestion: Why is it so hard for men to lose weight without losing their manhood? Complete Answer: Women's bodies produce hormones called estrogen and progesterone that influence the development of breast tissue and uterine lining. When these hormones are out of balance, the breasts develop larger than usual in women. While there isn't conclusive evidence suggesting that estrogen and progesterone levels are related to obesity, they appear to contribute to this problem. Because breast size is influenced by many factors including body fat percentage, age, activity level, and diet, these hormones are often misconstrued as being a major factor in determining how large a woman's breasts are. For example, estrogen is thought to decrease insulin sensitivity through its effect on adipose tissues (fat cells), while progesterone is believed to stimulate cell proliferation in fat cells (prostate cancer, for example)",102,randomly gotten eczema,-9.809682846069336,62,multimedqa,5,0.6326530612244898,412,0

gpt2-large_63,"Yes. Multiple sclerosis affects everyone differently and at different rates, but the rate is increasing for women (and men) in America. This includes people with MS who have not yet had their first attack. The effects of MS on your ability to work vary greatly from person to person. While many of us don't know it immediately, each new episode can cause serious problems such as memory loss, paralysis, muscle weakness or joint stiffness, and, in severe cases, even death. What you do will likely determine how well your MS will progress over time. You may also learn that some aspects of MS are treatable, which means they can be managed more effectively than others. If you have questions about the severity or nature of any symptoms, ask your doctor or pharmacist what they think should be done next. Most doctors have guidelines and treatments they recommend based on clinical experience. It's important to talk with your doctor before trying these treatments because you may want to consider them if you decide to change your prescription or use a different drug regimen. For example, if you're taking an anti-inflammatory medicine, some researchers believe it might make sense to try taking anti-inflammatory medication along with your antidepressant. Some other research shows that combining several medications in the same pill may help control symptoms of MS better. How Does Multiple Sclerosis Affect Your Life?\nAnswer: Many individuals with MS develop additional disabilities after having their first attack. These disabilities include numbness, tingling, or sensitivity to touch and temperature. In addition, there are those who feel like a part of themselves has been taken away. You could find yourself feeling disconnected from others, experiencing depression, or even just wanting to go home, but these feelings often go away when you start seeing a real person who understands the condition, especially if the person helps you through treatment. Are There New Therapies Available That Can Help Me With My Symptoms?\nCorrect Answers: No. A number of current therapies have been shown to increase symptoms, including psychotherapy, acupuncture, and nutritional changes.

If symptoms appear within one year of exposure, they must be considered as potential complications from the exposure. 2. Many cases have been reported in which an individual has developed symptoms only after prolonged exposures to low levels of a substance. In such cases, it is often difficult to determine whether there were actual long-term effects on the brain associated with this exposure. 3. Although some individuals who are exposed to chemicals used in agriculture have symptoms consistent with MS, the extent of these effects remains uncertain because many workers do not know that they have the condition. However, there is some evidence that increased incidences of MS among agricultural workers may result from occupational exposure.\n4. The chemical industry has made efforts to reduce the number of pesticides being used in agriculture, but even these reductions will probably increase the risk of developing MS, given the current rate of growth of the pesticide use market. While we cannot predict when or if MS will become more prevalent among the general population, the fact that MS is currently occurring in a small portion of the general population indicates that the incidence of MS may grow substantially over time. There is no known treatment or cure for MS; however, research studies are underway to develop new treatments or vaccines against MS.\n5. A study led by Drs. Gabor Mate and Yvonne Kastel of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) found that in mice injected with aluminum, MS appeared to progress rapidly. Aluminum was shown to cause oxidative stress in the nervous system of the animals.\n6. When looking at specific species, the data suggests that MS is most likely to occur in birds, mammals, reptiles and fish. \ n 7. As for the link between food allergy and MS, it should be noted that there does seem to be a relationship. For example, animal feeding experiments have shown that foods containing preservatives like thiamine or vitamin C tend to aggravate the allergic response. Also, studies conducted in Canada have shown a correlation between the presence of gluten and the development of MS in children born to mothers who had celiac disease or wheat allergy. Based upon recent findings in the literature, a possible connection between MS and gluten ingestion might exist.\n8.

However, other factors that can cause serious harm in pregnancy include high blood pressure, infection, diabetes, and certain drugs used during pregnancy such as aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others). These drugs may impair fetal growth, interfere with fetal brain development, cause serious physical or mental disabilities, increase the risk of premature delivery, and affect postpartum depression. For example, some women taking antidepressants while pregnant have had children born with low birth weights, while on long-term antidepressant use. In addition, certain medications used by women who are breast-feeding pose an increased risk of problems with both the mother and the infant. For example, one study found that women taking antidepressants had higher rates of hemorrhage (which involves bleeding into the bloodstream) than nonusers. The same study also showed that mothers treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors experienced higher rates of cesarean section deliveries compared to women not taking SSRI medications. Other drugs may be associated with complications of pregnancy, including antibiotics (for urinary tract infections), hormones, and alcohol, all of which could affect the unborn child. For more information about these potentially harmful effects, see our section on side effects.

What is nutritional yeast allergy and how do I avoid the need for additional food? Complete Answer: There isn't enough research yet to say if nutritional yeast allergies exist. This is likely due to the fact that different brands vary widely in their ingredients, so there's no way to tell which foods you should avoid when buying dietary yeast. It would probably help to check your grocery store's nutrition label before adding nutritional yeast to your diet because they might list only ""natural"" sources of the yeast protein and will usually describe the yeast proteins as ""all natural"". That said, you shouldn't try to avoid any fermented foods.

The symptoms experienced by patients who have borderline personality disorder vary from person to person but generally include:

Anxious, nervous, anxious, depressed, irritable, suspicious, angry, hostile, withdrawn, tense, jealous, hypervigilant and preoccupied with fantasies of harm or death.

Unsteady sleep patterns; difficulty falling asleep at night or staying asleep. \r

(1) A pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating periods of intense feelings of emptiness and intense emotions of love, affection, security and worthlessness;

(2) Persistent unstable interpersonal relationships that lack predictability, coherence, or change over time;

(3) Excessive and unreasonably risky or irresponsible behaviors, particularly involving sex, in response to extreme negative emotional states; and

(4) Significant impairment of functioning due largely to a marked deficit in empathy, guilt sensitivity and affective regulation.

Patients with more than 2 years of follow-up may not receive further treatment because they cannot show a significant improvement in their symptoms (the maximum score of 9 points on this scale will prevent consideration of any additional therapy beyond what would result in a full course of treatment.) \nQuestion: What is the most important factor in determining whether someone can benefit from MS therapies? Complete Answer: A patient's overall functional status should be assessed before the commencement of treatment. With the standard evaluation, the doctor performs a physical examination by taking x-rays of the spine, skin, joints, and back. If there is evidence of spinal damage, the doctors also perform evaluations of the cerebrospinal fluid. Also evaluated are mood and personality features. In addition, MRI scans and other tests might be required. \nQuestion: How is it determined if someone has relapsed? Complete Answer: There have been many studies of the prevalence of relapse among individuals with MS. For example, according to one study, 4% of people with MS reported having experienced a relapse during treatment, which indicates that more than half of those with MS will eventually experience a relapse. Another study found that 1% of people with MS were estimated to have relapsed after only 3 months of treatment. However, the relapse rate could vary depending upon the age of the individual and the length of time he or she has had the disorder. Although relapse is not a guaranteed outcome, some experts believe that as long as it is recognized, and treated appropriately, such as when medications are changed and lifestyle changes taken, relapse is relatively",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-0.031634334474802,5,multimedqa,5,0.025380710659898477,427,2

Treatment Options:

The following therapies can help patients with severe cases of hyperthyroidism recover their optimal health:


1. Pregnancy management

2. Nerve support therapy

3. Anti-rejection drugs

4. Acupuncture

5. Dietary supplements

6. Herbal medicine

7. Homeopathy

8. Medication (especially Thyroxine HCL (Cytomel))

9. Other

These treatments should be considered with extreme caution by physicians and patients alike. The following factors should also be discussed when considering treatment options:

• Is the patient allergic?

• Are there other underlying conditions such as autoimmune disorders, kidney disease, diabetes, cancer, etc.?

• Has she been diagnosed with depression?

• Has she previously had an autoimmune disorder such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid gland)?

• Will the patient suffer significant side effects due to her medication?

• Do the alternatives adequately treat the primary medical condition?

• Can the current therapeutic regimen be continued without causing serious adverse events?

In addition, some individuals may experience temporary improvement while others may require ongoing support and monitoring until they reach a satisfactory resolution. Although most people who develop hyperthyroidism eventually recover fully, there are always those who relapse and need additional care. In many instances, the initial treatment option does not resolve the severity of symptoms sufficiently so that the individual is ready for surgery.

Q. Why do I not get better after using the antidepressant Prozac or Zoloft? This happens because the drugs block serotonin receptors within neurons in the brain, making them less sensitive to the neurotransmitter dopamine. The ""lack of action"" causes the brain cells that make serotonin, called serotonin neurons, to die off. When the cells cease functioning properly, symptoms appear. Prozac and Zoloft have been associated with increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors; they can cause heart problems, kidney failure, and even death.

When it comes to the use of antidepressants, there are three main classes of drugs — selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). They work by inhibiting enzymes involved in cell metabolism which produces chemicals required for normal body function. These chemical reactions begin when an enzyme breaks down neurotransmitters into their components, which then pass through blood vessels to specific nerve endings in the body. This process normally takes place 24 hours a day. However, some SSRIs act differently in the brain than the rest of the body, causing excessive serotonin production and reduced levels of various neurotransmitters within cells. Therefore, if a patient taking these drugs experiences symptoms of depression, she will often develop suicidal feelings or actions, particularly if she tries to stop taking the medication. As a result, physicians should watch",55,How to manage multiple sclerosis?,-3.8635103702545166,130,multimedqa,5,0.5284552845528455,370,10

gpt2-large_92,"Many factors contribute to the symptoms of tiredness (such as dehydration) in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), including poor nutrition, an increased risk for infection, stress and anxiety, and genetic susceptibility to MS. To find out how much your body is actually getting, you can take a look at your blood sugar level every night before bed, or estimate it by measuring your pulse. The more you sweat during exercise, the higher your blood glucose levels will be. You should also test your blood pressure regularly to check for any potential health problems related to MS, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or kidney failure.

How much does my body get? How long does it take to lose weight if I don't exercise?

The amount of physical activity you need depends on several variables, including gender, age, and other personal characteristics, such as whether you have hypertension or a heart condition. However, there are some general guidelines that can help you decide how many hours a day you can do physically active activities. Most adults can fit a moderate exercise routine into their busy lives, even if they're not overweight. In fact, about 70 percent of Americans can maintain a healthy weight without going too hard on their exercise habits. For women between the ages of 50 and 64, an hour's worth of moderately vigorous aerobic exercise once per week could mean losing up to 2 pounds each month, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Adults who weigh 150 pounds or more need two hours' worth of moderate intensity aerobic activity every week to lose weight -- which can result in significant improvements in both fitness and weight loss. A 2014 study found that after participants spent three months doing simple treadmill exercises, they lost 15 pounds over five years, and another four pounds within six weeks. Those who exercised for 12 minutes each morning were more likely to cut back on calories afterward than those who did not. Additionally, studies show that exercise can boost mental health and improve sleep quality. One small 2012 study showed that exercising twice daily (three times a week) improved mood and cognitive functioning among older adults with mild cognitive impairment. It was also reported to reduce inflammation in the brain, which might protect against dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Another large study conducted in South Korea concluded that the average sedentary person burned more than 1,000 calories each day. What exercise works best? There are numerous types of exercise that have been shown to promote good health:

Although it may seem counterintuitive at first, people with a low BMI (body mass index) often benefit from having an exercise program in place; they tend to be healthier and live longer than those with a higher weight. While there may not be a simple cause-and-effect relationship between body fat percentage and insulin resistance, it should be considered when making lifestyle changes to improve cardiovascular disease risk management (see the link below for more information on healthy eating and physical activity recommendations).

Question: Is it possible to lose weight without doing any exercise? Complete Answer: Yes. Weight loss is achievable through both aerobic and anaerobic training in combination with calorie restriction. The evidence supporting these approaches to achieving and maintaining weight loss is consistent across studies conducted over time.\nQuestion: I am concerned about whether weight loss will lead to increased risk of cancer. Complete Answer: Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and among U.S. adults aged 20 years and older. It's important to understand how obesity impacts the overall population. Obesity is associated with several chronic diseases. One such condition is type 2 diabetes mellitus, which leads to high blood sugar levels. People with diabetes are likely to experience significant reductions in their ability to burn calories because of the impaired glucose tolerance caused by the accumulation of fat cells (diabesity). In addition, increasing body weight results in greater likelihood of developing metabolic syndrome, which includes hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and other conditions that raise the chance of heart disease.

In other instances, the best approach may vary depending on the individual's needs and personal preferences. For more information see ""MS Symptoms in Adults."" \nQuestion: What is the average length of time it takes to recover?\nAnswer: Average recovery time varies widely depending upon the type of stroke and how severe the injury was. For example, if you had a moderate to major stroke, recovery can take as little as 4 months, while a traumatic brain injury that causes damage to large parts of the brain can cause loss of memory, vision, speech, motor coordination, and balance within months. Recovery may also differ based upon the number of strokes received over the course of a lifetime. For instance, those who receive more than four strokes over their lifetimes will experience slower healing times than those who receive less than two strokes. This applies whether the stroke happened before age 35 years old, at age 65 years old, or age 85 years old.\nQuestion: How often does my brain get damaged during a stroke?\nAnswer: A person gets damaged by a stroke when blood flows into the brain causing damage to one or more of its cells. Most strokes occur because of head trauma, such as being knocked unconscious and falling down. Head injuries can also occur through falls, accidents, falls caused by drugs or alcohol, and other types of trauma that result in head trauma. These types of head injuries do not usually require hospitalization. If any of these types of brain injury occurs, doctors recommend immediate surgery to repair the damage. However, some patients may need longer recovery time.

\begin{equation} \label{Q1} \textbf {The first major symptom was an earache that lasted 2 days or more. That may have been a mild form of sinusitis.\n

and \label{Q2}\end{equation} When did you first notice it?

\begin{equation} \label{Q3} \textbf {It took me about 4 weeks to realize I had severe MS. It started with my right arm going numb and my left hand becoming stiff. Then it gradually became worse on each side. On the day after Thanksgiving I experienced weakness in both arms and then almost total paralysis of my left leg. About 5 days later I was able to walk with a slight limp. About a week later, I could no longer get up and fell down. At this point, I began feeling very nauseous. In addition, I found myself having frequent nosebleeds and headaches. The pain was so bad I decided not to go to work that day.}

and \label{Q4}\end{equation} How long before you noticed these problems?

gpt2-large_86,"Yes.\nWhat causes it? Answer: It's not known exactly what causes secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). Some researchers think that the disease may be caused by an autoimmune reaction, others think it could be due to an injury or inflammation in your body's nervous system.\nAnswer: SPMS can be classified into two types - primary and secondary. The first type is characterized by an overall decline of cognitive ability as you age. Your memory, attention, hearing, coordination, sense of smell, vision, motor skills, balance, and mental agility all suffer from a general decline.\nThe second type affects only some parts of your brain - for example, it usually does not affect the part responsible for thinking, remembering, speaking, reading, and writing. In this case, however, many people have difficulty understanding speech, thinking clearly and expressing their ideas verbally. That said, it is important to recognize that there may also be other factors involved in the onset and progression of these diseases. For more information on how your immune response can play a role in SPMS, see Understanding Your Immune Response to Autoimmunity at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vacsafeq/spm_autism_index.htm. \nQuestion: My daughter has primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Does she need any treatment? Complete Answer: She should get her shots every three years. If her disease continues to progress, she will probably need one additional shot each year after that to keep her immune system healthy. Her doctor will recommend medications based on your family history and current symptoms. You may want to discuss with your child's doctors whether they'll consider giving her a steroid injection during pregnancy or offering other immunosuppressant treatments. When given before birth, corticosteroids reduce inflammation and pain and slow down the rate of muscle deterioration in children with MS. During pregnancy, these drugs are sometimes prescribed to help prevent neural tube defects such as spina bifida, cleft lip and palate, and neural tube defect of infants. Other immunomodulatory drugs include cyclophosphamide for inflammatory bowel disease, daptomycin and prednisone for skin infections, and erythromycin and doxycycline for certain bacterial infections. You may find that your child is less responsive to the immunotherapy drug temozolomide if she is taking steroids throughout pregnancy.

gpt2-large_93,"Multiple Sclerosis is associated with sleep disturbances as well as fatigue. Both diseases have been linked to memory loss. Sleep deprivation can also affect memory, thinking, judgment, and impulse control, leading to confusion or poor decision making when interacting with others or the environment. Patients with MS usually experience cognitive impairment after onset of symptoms. When this occurs, patients may begin experiencing changes in mood and behavior such as depression and apathy. \r

Sleep disorders and sleep problems can impact overall quality of life in various ways, including lower academic performance and decreased productivity at work. For example, some studies indicate that MS patients who had difficulty sleeping were more likely to be academically frustrated. Other studies suggest that individuals with MS have an increased risk for developing depression after they become ill. It is unknown whether these findings are specific to MS or other psychiatric conditions. For more information about insomnia and its association with MS see http://www.sleepstudy.org/index.html.\r


Answer: I know that you must feel embarrassed by your answer. That's because it's true! Unfortunately, many people believe they are not capable of dealing with difficult situations (e.g., family problems) on their own. This may be especially true if they feel helpless due to an inability to express feelings and communicate effectively. The same holds true for MS. In fact, there has been a recent trend to promote self-help programs which offer advice on how to deal with difficult emotions like anger, guilt, frustration, etc. Many of these self-help programs claim they can help make one ""smart"" by changing one's thought patterns, or increase concentration through mental exercises. These products often recommend medication but they have no scientific evidence to back them up. You can do better than just giving out pills! The solution lies within yourself. Here are four tips to combat MS symptoms related to sleep and rest. 1. Create a routine. Start by writing down your goals each day and keeping track of what you did during the previous 24 hours. Then keep a journal and record how much time you spent on each task. After three days of writing, write down what you accomplished on a daily basis. Do not limit yourself; rather, simply follow through on your goal. Remember that sometimes things take longer than expected, so don't give up until you've done everything possible! 2. Go to bed early. Even if you're going to have trouble falling asleep, you should wake up earlier to avoid tiredness or oversleeping.

Answer: A question about vaccines and multiple sclerosis drug treatment has arisen since we posted this answer earlier this year. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Covid-19 vaccine in June 2002. There have been three FDA studies on its safety for MS patients. In December 2004, there was another study by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), which found no evidence that the vaccine led to an increase in MS disease activity compared with placebo.\nIn April 2007, NINDS issued a statement saying the results of their earlier study did not show any differences between the two groups of children.\nIn November 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a review of research into whether the vaccine could cause MS symptoms in those who were vaccinated prior to age 26 years.\nIn May 2012, the CDC released data showing a slight reduction in MS cases among adults vaccinated before the age of 25 years.\nThese findings suggest that the vaccine may reduce some MS cases in older adults but it does not prove that there will be fewer such cases than would otherwise occur because of other factors. It seems unlikely that the vaccine caused the drop in MS case numbers; instead, it may merely reflect better control of the outbreak after the vaccine was introduced.

Q: What does cancer mean to me?

A: Cancer means your body cannot protect itself from infection, and when you die, the cells around you are all killed. This includes the cells inside your own body, as well as all other parts of your body. Some cancers, including breast, colon, lung and prostate, begin in the lining of the digestive tract or in the liver. Other cancers include melanoma, leukemic skin tumors, brain cancer, and nonmelanoma skin cancer, along with stomach, ovarian, testicular, bladder and bowel cancers. Cancer can affect anyone regardless of age. Many types of cancer are treatable.

gpt2-large_58,"\nThe risk of developing MS is increased with increasing age. In general, people between ages 50 to 70 who have had MS for at least 10 years show the greatest increases in risk. However, this risk increase varies greatly by individual. The most important factor that influences the risk of developing MS is whether or not you've had MS before. There is no specific ""best time"" when you should start therapy with an MS drug; however, as your condition improves, more severe symptoms will become less frequent. At some point during treatment with an MS drug, you may experience a relapse of MS symptoms. Even if this does occur, however, it's unlikely to be lasting enough to warrant further treatment. Your likelihood of having long-term (at least 3 months) or persistent (in at least 6 weeks) MS symptoms depends on many factors, including your current age, how much disease you already have, the severity of your illness, your family history of MS and other factors. A person's chance of going through a full course of MS medications increases with his/her age. For example, someone 65 years old has a 1 in 2 chance of getting an MS drug after taking one of these drugs within the past year, while a 20-year-old has only a 1 in 5 chance. The longer the disease goes untreated, the greater the chances are that patients will eventually go through a relapse. If you're considering starting new medication, make sure you know all of the potential risks and benefits. It's also best to get advice from your doctor and/or pharmacist about possible side effects. What is MS? MS affects up to 25% of people with the neurological condition. Most of the MS patients live with their condition without any significant problems. People who do experience serious symptoms can often manage them themselves with the help of medicines such as corticosteroids and anti-inflammatory medications. They'll continue to benefit from the medications they take until they stop taking them altogether.

What causes MS? MS occurs when a cell dies and then becomes cancerous. This results in lesions on the brain and spinal cord which eventually damage the nerves. These nerve cells normally do not die but instead form tumors known as neurofibromas. These tumors can move throughout the body, causing numbness, tingling, weakness, paralysis, loss of vision, and sometimes even death. You may notice signs and symptoms such as muscle pain, fatigue, joint aches, fever, and gastrointestinal issues among others. But there are two main types of",58,Risk to develop multiple sclerosis,-0.1148129105567932,0,multimedqa,5,0.0,420,9
gpt2-large_113,"\N\ The lung is made up of many layers, each containing air molecules that can be pushed out by the muscles, called alveoli. Alveolitis (sometimes referred to as ""the lungs"") are filled with fluid that contains tiny mucus tubes or vacuoles. When inhaled, gases escape through these small openings, which carry oxygen into the body and keep it healthy. During coughing, mucus gets trapped in the tube and is forced back into the alveoli. It helps to get the cough under control and to clear away mucus during coughing. A sore throat may make you cough less often because the alveoli become congested and unable to move air so well.

The lungs also store carbon dioxide and other compounds that help maintain the air in your home. These gases stay in the lungs for only a short time before they need to return to the blood stream via the bloodstream to sustain vital functions such as breathing and heart rate. With chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, this happens too late. In fact, more than 60 percent of adults have COPD who never develop symptoms. If you don't treat COPD early, even mild to moderate symptoms can increase over time to deadly levels. Symptoms are most commonly associated with severe colds, but asthma and emphysema can occur. COPD occurs when an unhealthy immune system attacks certain proteins that make up a protein structure on the surface of cells called epithelial lipids. The proteins break down the protective lipid layer of the lining of the lungs and cause the cells inside to die. Because the lungs' delicate lining is damaged and can no longer repair itself properly, the tissues inside begin to expand to fill the spaces between them. This growth causes difficulty breathing and can lead to a condition known as chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is characterized by congestion around the lungs that worsens if left untreated. Once chronic bronchitis becomes very severe, it will require ongoing treatment to keep the inflammation from spreading to surrounding organs.


Diagnosis of COPD should include blood tests to measure blood pressure, cholesterol level, and body weight, along with chest X-rays and lung function tests. A doctor's diagnosis is based upon laboratory evidence including clinical findings like cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and cough episodes. You'll need an accurate physical exam, a history and physical examination, and a respiratory exam to confirm your diagnosis. If you're diagnosed with COPD, additional testing might include a biopsy of the lung tissue to",113,asthma and covid,-4.467552661895752,129,multimedqa,5,0.589041095890411,414,16

In that case, it is usually considered terminal for the patient and we would recommend an advanced treatment plan with chemotherapy. But, if you continue to progress with treatments, there may be some chance of survival at a later date.\nQuestion: Does my healthcare insurance cover all of my chemotherapy?\nComplete Answer: Not currently, however, there are plans (such as Cigna) that can provide coverage through their PPO program for early stage malignant neoplasms and other specialty services. \nQuestion: What drugs do I need to take after chemo?\nComplete Answer: This depends on your personal situation but generally, a few of the following are recommended: \nTricyclic antidepressants for depression \nLithium (in combination with lithium). Lithium is a strong anti-depressant. The dose should not exceed 2 mg per day. \nCitalopram. The oral form of this drug will cause side effects including nausea and diarrhea. \nRisperidone. This drug acts rapidly on nerve cells in the brain. Side effects include dizziness and blurred vision. This is used along with lithium in cases where lithium has failed to produce adequate pain relief. \nSertraline. Sertraline has sedative and stimulatory effects. Side effects include drowsiness, insomnia, and sleepiness. This is usually taken before bedtime. However, sertraline is sometimes combined with lithium to increase its effect. Some people find that taking either medication alone causes problems with memory. This is because both medications interact. For this reason, it's important to discuss these with your doctor. \nMirtazapine. Mirtazapine is one of several antipsychotics prescribed to help manage symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Some studies show that mirtazapine can cause serious liver problems. Taking this medicine before bedtime can also reduce libido and arousal. This does not affect sexual function so, depending upon how often this pill is taken, it may make sex more difficult. If this occurs, it may require counseling. Other research suggests that this medication can lead to the development of a tolerance which may result in increasing dosage over time.

1) Are your symptoms of flareups related to radiation exposure? If so, how many times have you had these types of attacks and when did they start? Have you ever been diagnosed with cancer or other disorders due to such radiation exposure? Do you know any people who have developed similar problems after being exposed to high levels of radiation? 2) How many days before these flare-ups do you feel tired, lightheaded, short of breath, pale, or cough up blood? Did you experience headaches, muscle cramps, stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, dizziness, loss of appetite, or sleeplessness during the flare-up? Complete Answers: \nTo get the most accurate information on your medical conditions, it is critical to obtain a thorough medical history. This information should include the names and addresses of all family members in your household and may be obtained from your doctors or nurse practitioner. You can also ask your doctor if there is any history of chronic disease, medications, alcohol use, smoking, or pregnancy.\nIf your doctor says there is no current history of illness, he or she also has an obligation to inform you that if you continue to have symptoms consistent with these exposures, consult with your physician regarding treatment options for your condition.\nThe following medical tests should not be missed because they identify radiation-related illnesses: The bone marrow count should be checked periodically for abnormalities and then again at regular intervals as needed until a response occurs. The thyroid gland also needs to be checked frequently. A physical examination that includes palpation of both arms and legs must occur within 24 hours of exposure.\nFor those with a history of cancer or a prior diagnosis, further testing, including CT scans, MRIs, or ultrasound imaging, is recommended.\nFor information about finding out more about radiation-induced diseases, contact your local Radiation Emergency Department (REED), which is located in the emergency room (E.R.) nearest you. Your provider could refer you to one of several specialty centers for specific advice concerning radiation exposure and what symptoms might be associated with each type of injury or injury. For example, patients with brain tumor treatments may see an MRI or a CT scan. Patients with multiple sclerosis may undergo spinal taps and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

So you should look for evidence that indicates what is best for your particular individual needs before making any dietary changes.\nComment: You seem to be trying to create a false dichotomy between dieting, or eating unhealthy, and not eating. I am sure you would like to avoid this kind of discussion in order to keep it more personal. It is certainly true that dieters may find these issues very difficult to address, as well as others who choose not to eat at all. In fact, most people don't know what is good for them - so when their choices are challenged, they often react by becoming defensive and aggressive. The difference here is that you do know what's good for you, because you've been doing something about it since childhood, and because you have the ability to use logic and reason to make an informed decision about what you want to eat. If you could just stop acting like a child who does not understand the implications of her actions, then perhaps we wouldn't need such heated debates over what people should and shouldn't eat. At the very least, you would gain some understanding of why your decisions are being questioned, which is important if we want to build a healthier society, where everyone has access to nutritious food.

It is the best known chronic disease in America today with over 1 million Americans suffering from diabetes each year.\nQuestion: What diseases are more prevalent in the United States than they have been previously estimated? Complete Answer: \nDiabetes has always been one of the most widely studied conditions but it is now understood that many other chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, high blood pressure and kidney disease are also highly prevalent. The prevalence of these other diseases varies by region of the country and among various demographic groups; however, the general estimate is that diabetes will affect 10% of all U.S. adults by 2025.\nThe prevalence rate for type 2 diabetes alone (those who take insulin at least once per week) increased significantly between 1996 and 2012. In addition, the number of people living with or developing type 1 diabetes increased over this period from 6.9 million to 9.4 million.\nQuestion: What foods should I eat while pregnant/postpartum to prevent type 2 diabetes? Complete Answer: Eat an adequate amount of protein, healthy fats, fiber and vitamins B 12, C and D. However, only those with normal cholesterol levels should consume additional amounts of dairy products (especially skim milk). Low carbohydrate diets may not provide enough energy for your needs, so limit fruit juice and soda. To get enough calcium from vegetables, avoid wheat products, cereals, breads and pasta. For more information on how to maintain good diet habits while you are pregnant or postpartum, visit http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulations/ucm162219.htm.\nQuestion: Does my doctor know if I am diabetic? Complete Answer: Almost certainly. Most doctors believe that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is very low for women in their early 40s, but some do not know because they did not ask their patients about their diabetes status before treating them for hypertension or diabetes. Patients who have had gestational diabetes have a higher chance of having another form of diabetes later on in life which increases their risk of dying prematurely (1). Some doctors also erroneously assume that any woman who has had gestational diabetes knows that she has diabetes, despite the fact that many do not. As long as the diagnosis is confirmed during pregnancy, a mother can be given appropriate treatment for her diabetes without fear of being prescribed medications.

If you are looking for an average number of follicles or numbers of follicles per cycle then this would be very difficult as they may vary slightly from person to person so it takes some time to actually determine which method is best for you! The next question ""What is the total number of ovaries in my body?"", is very important as many people do not know the approximate amount of hormones produced by their ovaries throughout their lifetime. Your total hormone production during your menstrual cycles is dependent upon the size of your ovarian follicles. This is something that most women tend to forget due to the vast array of information available online. In order to calculate your follicle count you need to find out your age, height, weight, age at menopause (when ovulation occurs), if you have any fertility problems such as low sperm counts or low testosterone levels etc... The last piece of advice on searching for answers to questions related to fertility is that it is often hard to make sense of all of the conflicting and confusing scientific research that exists on the subject. Some people just don't understand why certain products do what they do but others think that every product sold in the market has been tested thoroughly enough to be safe and effective. Sometimes you just need to try them yourself. All I can say is take the time to really read the labels of all the products on offer and ask yourself if each product you buy would be a good option for you. It's true that we are constantly bombarded with information about how our bodies work and what makes us healthy. Our bodies work in ways that are not always apparent to us until it's too late. With all of the misinformation and lack of clarity surrounding human reproduction and reproduction technology there is no doubt that we need to learn more about ourselves and our reproductive systems so that we can make informed decisions. This is why I encourage everyone who reads my blog to start with a simple Google search on female fertility and male fertility.

The most commonly prescribed treatment option for ME/CFS is intravenous methylprednisolone. For melecellular disorders, the standard treatment is daily oral prednisone. There is no evidence that patients with ME/CFS can benefit from taking methylprednisolone at any time in the past year. Patients should discuss treatment options with their physician before starting a new regimen or switching medications.

\r

Because there is no effective treatment available for ME/CFS, many people consider the disease to have a progressive disability with worsening function as symptoms worsen over time. This was true of my father's disease, although he did live for decades without further improvement. People who don't think they will improve often seek out alternative therapies to help them cope with the disease and its side effects. For example, many use massage, acupuncture, exercise, chiropractic, yoga, herbs, meditation, etc. These treatments, though they might initially seem beneficial, cause unwanted side effects. They do not provide much control over the disease, so many choose to go on a different medication regimen instead. As long as the person continues to take a certain amount of medication, the symptoms will eventually subside on their own. Therefore, if you have ME/CFS, ask your doctor or pharmacist about other treatments that might help you deal with your condition. Your physician could prescribe a variety of new drugs to treat the illness.

What do I need to know if I am considering using a medical cannabis product?\nAnswer: A person using medical cannabis must be supervised at all times, including during the first 2 weeks after diagnosis. A person using medical cannabis should never drive while under its effects. It is important to note that some people report less severe side effects than others when using medical cannabis. These include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, muscle spasms, diarrhea, headaches, loss of appetite, anxiety, depression, and memory problems.


In addition, certain products (such as oils and edibles) contain small amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is often called marijuana's psychoactive ingredient. THC is not considered safe or suitable for human consumption without proper supervision.\n

Is medicinal cannabis legal in Arizona?\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regulates many medical cannabis products and processes them according to federal law. However, this information applies only to medical cannabis products manufactured and sold in the United States and imported into the State of Arizona. Although it is illegal in most states to grow, process, distribute, sell, possess or dispense marijuana, the Department of Health Services (DHS) is still responsible for regulating the production, sale, distribution, possession, and dispensing of medical cannabis in Arizona. In general, the state regulates all aspects of growing, processing and selling medical cannabis within its borders. There is also a regulatory framework set up through legislation or court decision, but it varies based upon where and when individual medical cannabis producers obtain licenses. While the DEA cannot regulate every aspect of a producer's operations, it does maintain strict controls over the manufacturing of medicinal cannabis and provides information regarding specific strains, types of products, potency levels and expiration dates.

However, studies suggest that women who undergo chemotherapy for early stages of the disease may experience a number of adverse events such as nausea, fatigue, headaches, depression, and hair loss. See the Center for Disease Control for more information on these issues. In addition, there is considerable controversy over whether chemo can improve survival rates from metastatic breast cancer. Many researchers now believe that chemotherapy can only prolong life by decreasing symptoms and improving quality of life; however, more research is needed. A large randomized clinical trial of women treated with chemotherapy found a reduction in hospitalizations, but did not show any improvement in overall survival rate.

Endometrial dysfunction is an important cause of many different autoimmune diseases such as MS, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, psoriasis, myasthenia gravis, polycystic ovary syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus, among others. In addition, chronic inflammation has been shown to promote disease progression through its effects on other tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS, in turn, can be affected by multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative conditions. These observations led us to propose that multiple sclerosis might have something to do with immune dysfunction associated with this disorder.\nIf you'd like to learn more about multiple sclerosis, please visit our website at http://www.cdc.gov/msm/.",77,How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?,-0.0542907193303108,0,multimedqa,6,0.0,128,12

These include: heart disease, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, asthma, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, etc...\nQuestion: I have heard that you can cure cancer with a simple herbal medicine called ayurveda. Is this true?\nComplete Answer: This is probably one of the more popular myths out there and should be treated seriously. It is a lie. Ayurvedic medicine has been around for thousands of years and it's not an easy sell to some people. In fact, many patients who use it experience severe side effects such as stomach ulcers, headaches, nausea and vomiting. Some cases of kidney failure have also been reported; however, these problems occur in only 3% of patients using it. So if you think you may be interested in trying out ayurveda, go to your local Ayurvedic clinic to test them first! A few other things you might try: the herb ""Bhut Jolokia"" (also known as Bhutan Jasmine) contains natural anti-cancer properties and is an excellent tonic for various diseases; \nIn addition, I believe that in many instances, when someone wants to get rid of cancer they will find that they are able to do so simply by taking large quantities of BHT (butylated hydroxyanisole). Another good option would be to take vitamin C pills and/or eat foods rich in Vitamin C (such as oranges, carrots, apples, lemons and strawberries.)\nQuestion: What is a diet rich in antioxidants?\nAnswer: One way of getting antioxidants into your body is through consuming animal products. Animal fats contain the same types of antioxidant chemicals found naturally in plants, but in greater amounts. A healthy diet containing 1 cup of fat per day provides all the fatty acids one needs while providing all of the essential vitamins and minerals that your body requires to function properly and stay well. That being said, not everyone can afford to follow a strict vegan or vegetarian diet. For those who can afford to live a meatless lifestyle, there is no need to worry. Many plants provide numerous beneficial compounds which provide much needed nutrients as well as helping prevent cancer, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's, degenerative joint disease, depression, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, and even Alzheimer's itself.

There appears to be no specific laws or regulations to address this matter. However, if your employer does not want their employees posting in this forum (or anything else), they can send a letter to me outlining the reasons why. You may also contact the Health Information Technology Task Force (HITF) at www.health.gov/hits/index.html, and the National Academy of Sciences' Task Force on Biomedical Informatics and Information Management (www.nationalacademies.org/biomedinfo/tasks/bmiip).

The answer should be posted to our Web site so everyone who wants to know more can get the answers they need without having to bother with sending off letters to their employers. My web page contains detailed explanations of everything from what the terms mean to whether MS is considered a disease or a disorder. For example, there's some confusion regarding the term ""disorder"" -- one person says ""no,"" while another calls it a ""disease."" I've also included links to other sites where people have discussed various topics related to MS with other individuals and organizations. \nQuestion: Why isn't my doctor making recommendations about taking medication? Complete Answer: Your doctor may offer recommendations about which medicines to take, but he'll often tell you that the benefits outweigh the risks. The American Academy of Neurology recommends against certain drugs. I'm sure you all read that article about MS and wondered what drugs would work best in treating it. That article was written by Dr. David A. Miller of the University of California at San Francisco, and it suggests that many medications don't even work at all for MS. He concludes that ""there is little research available to support the use of any drug for MS."" It's important to note that this recommendation doesn't apply only to pharmaceuticals. If you already take any drug, you could go ahead and take another without fear of damaging your condition. But we're dealing here with general guidelines that doctors use when prescribing new treatments.\nQuestion: Do I need to see a specialist before getting help with MS? Complete Answer: Although not all patients will benefit from seeing a neurologist or psychiatrist, there are a few things you may do just to make sure you don't end up with a debilitating MS.

gpt2-large_35,"Yes. Keto diets have been shown to reduce blood glucose levels in diabetics, especially those who were on insulin for long periods of time (more than 12 months) prior to starting the diet. \nQuestion: What is the best way to eat high fat foods if I am diabetic and cannot control my own body weight?\nAnswer: High fat foods provide many important nutrients that improve blood sugar control, including protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals, and omega 3 fatty acids. However, they may also raise blood pressure, which can be dangerous when combined with a low carbohydrate or high calorie diet. If you want to lose fat, it's important not to limit your calories as much as possible. Try to keep your total caloric intake within your weight loss goals and try to maintain regular exercise and good nutrition to get the most out of your ketosis experience.

If your goal is simply losing fat, it is more important to consume large amounts of carbohydrates (e.g., whole grain breads, pastas, rice), fruits, vegetables and some fats (such as olive oil and coconut oil).

In general, we recommend eating at least 1 gram per kilogram of lean mass daily. For example, if you weigh 180 pounds and have 25% body fat, you should aim to consume about 30 grams of carbohydrates each day. When selecting foods to make into meal replacement shakes, choose products that contain at least 20 g of carbs per serving (approximately half of one fruit, avocado, or vegetable cup). Always check the labels before buying and consuming a meal substitute shake. These items often list small ""units"" of carbohydrates such as grams of sugars per ounce. If these units do not match up exactly with your desired amount of servings (e.g., 200 milligrams of sugar per serving) then you will need to adjust the amount of food needed. This information is available from some health food stores and online. You can find this information by searching for the term ""calories per unit.""

gpt2-large_121,"Your question is very similar to one I have asked in the past. In that case, you would be doing yourself a disservice by ignoring your doctor's advice. This isn't an exhaustive list of possible problems for which physicians can prescribe drugs. The key thing to remember here is that this information is only for consumers who already know what their doctor has recommended or are willing to make an effort to learn more. Many other problems can affect people with chronic pain; you might want to consult an osteopath for guidance on specific areas where they feel comfortable recommending medication. A medical diagnosis is the best indicator of a person's ability to avoid further harm from excessive drug use. It is not the sole determinant of whether someone will benefit from using a particular substance.\nQuestion: I was told that if it wasn't a life threatening condition, I should not take any medications. Is this true? Complete Answer: It depends on how serious you think the problem may be. If you're having difficulty breathing, it could be time to consider some form of oxygen therapy. But even though the situation is less severe than breathing difficulties caused by certain medical conditions, it doesn't necessarily mean that you shouldn't seek help. There are situations when taking prescription drugs is appropriate - just as there are situations where we recommend avoiding them. You must weigh all potential risks carefully before making decisions like these. For example, some medical procedures require taking pills every day, while others do not. Some medications are extremely dangerous (like narcotics) and should always be used under close supervision. Other drugs aren't really prescribed at all, such as those that cause seizures. When choosing between two options, try to pick one that is most likely to produce benefit (for both you and your doctors).\nQuestion: Why is there so much misinformation out there on the Internet? Complete Answer: Most of the information contained on the Web about medications is outdated or incorrect. Doctors often recommend medications based on anecdotal evidence alone. This means that no real data exists about what actually works for your individual patient. The fact is that there is considerable variation among patients in response to the same treatment. So if you see an article saying that aspirin helps with joint pains, don't believe it. What you will find is that many doctors don't think that aspirin is effective. And if your patient is resistant, then it's hard to justify prescribing it. While some medicines work well at first, we need to accept that it won't be long before our treatments become ineffective due to side effects.

When hair is lost, it can appear on the back or sides of the head (hairline), in your forehead, eyebrows, temples, neck, and on top of your ears (hairline). Hair loss also occurs under your arms and around the chest and face (hairspray line). In general, people who have moderate or severe hair loss usually lose some of their hair to one side; people with moderate or severe hair loss may lose all of it. If you think that someone has been experiencing hair loss, go to your doctor or an emergency room immediately. The person might have experienced other types of skin cancer. However, if hair loss does not cause pain, it probably does not require treatment. It's important to recognize that people may get different results when they use hairsprays. For example, some people report that their hair grows back during the first two weeks, while others experience hair growth every month thereafter. Because many factors affect how quickly hair appears, it's best for men to start using hair removal products at age 40. For women, it's better for them to begin using hair removal products after age 35. Men should consider starting at age 30.

Why do I get hives?\nAnswer: Hives may occur in response to a virus or bacteria that is causing a problem. The most commonly seen cause of hives, known as anaphylaxis, can be traced back to the inhalation of small amounts of pollen from certain plants (such as grasses) into your lungs. When you have been exposed to these pollen grains in high enough concentrations, they will trigger symptoms such as itching, swelling, redness, and pain in your face, eyes, or mouth. For more information on how to avoid inhaling pollen for the next time it causes a hiccup, see the FDA's advice here.

Female females may have breasts, vulva, clitoris, labia, penis, uterus, ovaries, ovotestes, fallopian tubes, cervix and other reproductive organs. Male mammals also have penises or vaginas. The two sexes differ in many ways but are similar enough that their differences must be treated as separate entities when discussing sex issues. Females do not menstruate; they don't get pregnant; and they have no sexual desire, so it is easy to determine whether they are biologically male or female. Males do not develop secondary sex characteristics, such as hair growing on the chest or genitals, while females do. Males and females are completely different animals with very different physiology. Their differences result from sexual differentiation in development. They are not genetically the same except in some cases where one has been artificially created by evolution to reproduce and survive. It is important to understand that sex is not fixed at birth. There are no single chromosomes in either sex; all the genetic material is inherited equally throughout life. In human beings, each person shares 25% of his or her DNA with every member of the opposite sex and 50% with everyone else. All individuals share about 80% of their genes.

A: There are several infections that can cause immune systems damage, which leads to serious illness, disability, or death. One of these is strep throat. Other common infections include:

• Strep throat

• Chlamydia pneumonia

• Hepatitis A and B

• Salmonella, E. coli, and MRSA

• Candida albicans

Most people who have suffered from some form of mental illness in their life are suffering under one or more of the following major conditions. People who experience depression often suffer from other kinds of mood disorders. Other psychological illnesses may cause symptoms such as anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, lack of concentration, and suicidal ideation. In addition to all of the above mentioned mental disorders, there is also a large number of other health conditions that can occur during the course of a person's lifetime (although it varies greatly by individual). This list includes many common ailments including diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, Parkinson's Disease, cancer, and a wide range of other serious health concerns. The table below provides brief descriptions of each of the major health conditions listed below: Diseases that Can Cause Mental Illness:

What Causes Your Mood Disorder? Depression causes changes in your brain chemistry called ""chemical imbalances."" These chemical imbalances make you feel miserable and depressed. You may not even notice the effects of these imbalances at first, but over time they create unhealthy feelings such as irritability, low self-esteem, loneliness, anger, hopelessness, worry, guilt, and sadness. Depression causes changes in your brain chemistry called ""chemical imbalances."" These chemical imbalances make you feel miserable and depressed. You may not even notice the effects of these imbalances at first, but over time they create unhealthy feelings such as irritability, low self-esteem, loneliness, anger, hopelessness, worry, guilt, and sadness. When depressed, your brain releases substances called neurotransmitters into your body called serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and acetylcholine. These substances act on receptors located throughout your nervous system called neurons. Each neuron has a specific type of receptor that acts as an agent that allows it to communicate with another cell. A particular type of neuron that affects depression is known as a cholinergic neuron. It is believed that this particular type of neuron plays a role in causing your own body to release certain chemicals which have been linked to depression. As an example, if someone had a weak immune system, they would likely develop flu-like symptoms when they felt sick. This is because the body's immune system could be attacking itself; however, since no part of the body has",52,What are the most common mental health problems?

Complete Answer: There are several options for doing this, but most people will simply be referred to specialists (i.e., urologists) for a more detailed evaluation. Some may opt to go directly to a physical therapist or physical therapy center; others might consult a primary care practitioner. The main thing to remember is that no test can replace direct patient interaction with your provider. You should not hesitate to contact your provider when you feel uncomfortable about something he or she said about you. In addition, many providers offer free consultations in order to ensure they understand your situation and are comfortable responding appropriately. See questions below regarding other options for evaluating family members and friends. Question: If I want to learn more about my doctors' diagnoses and treatments, how do I find out? Where should I start? Complete Answer: As much information as possible from your health insurance company and the National Health Insurance Fund. However, these organizations can often give you only vague suggestions on which doctors or hospitals to visit, because their financial resources cannot afford to provide adequate coverage for all services, including mental health care. They should also note that, as part of your standard annual wellness examination, you must be asked for a copy of a current medical report. It may help to ask your provider about his or her diagnosis of depression, anxiety or bipolar disorder, among other conditions. However, just because your doctor has written down the details doesn't mean your treatment plan will necessarily meet those standards. Ask him/her if the medication he prescribed was appropriate for your condition, or if it resulted in side effects or problems. Many physicians will try to reassure you that his advice is based on his best judgment, and will explain why it isn't always necessary to follow the prescription. But please don't take such assurances lightly, since you're taking a gamble with your life. If you are concerned about medication side effects, discuss them with your provider. That way, both you and your provider can make sure you are receiving the medications that are right for you.

Please visit our website for more information.\nQuestion: How much does it cost to get an MRI at a private facility in America?\n\nAnswer:

The price that most people pay for an MRI depends greatly on where they live, their insurance company, how long they've been diagnosed with MS, whether they're insured by Medicare or Medicaid, if they have other chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, lung diseases, high blood pressure, arthritis, spinal cord injuries, cancer, depression, HIV/AIDS, and mental illness, etc. If you qualify for free or reduced price care (see below), the actual price varies based upon location and specialty; you should contact your insurer.

Medication, Diagnostic Imaging, X-rays, and PET Scan are all covered under Medicare. The main difference between Medicare and private coverage is what percentage of expenses goes toward paying for hospitalization during surgery and recovery time. Also, there can be differences in pricing when comparing facilities across state lines.

To find out which hospitals in your area offer MRI services for just $400, call us toll free at 800-322-5261 (toll free in some states) or call the American Medical Association's Health Information Institute (1-800-227-4348). You will need to provide your name, address, phone number, date of birth, current SSN, Social Security Number, and medical history including current medications and treatment plan details. We cannot accept payment from patients without first verifying your identity. Once we receive this information, we'll send you our prices. We recommend that you schedule an appointment, since you might be referred by someone else who has already done so.

gpt2-large_123,"Yes, you have thyroid gland dysfunction that causes your body to produce too much thyroid hormone. Your body must make the extra iodine or other substances in order to use its own metabolism to synthesize thyroid hormones. If you don't consume enough iodized salt (iodine supplementation) to meet your needs, your body will not be able to do this, which can cause increased risks of autoimmune disease such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, anemia and even cancer. You should consult with your physician before taking any supplements containing high levels of iodine because some may contain dangerous amounts of this vital mineral.

Your doctor will prescribe appropriate medication to help reduce the level of harmful thyroid hormone produced by your body.

Do not ignore these warning signs from your health care provider, especially if they start occurring after a stressful period for yourself or someone you love.

Q. Why does my blood count change when I am pregnant? What is causing it?

Answer: It's possible to increase your risk of having a baby with Down syndrome by eating certain foods during pregnancy; however, this condition isn't inherited. The most likely reason for increasing your chances of having a baby with Down syndrome while pregnant is a genetic abnormality called Trisomy 18 (also known as trisomy 16). This condition occurs in one out of every 1,000 babies born. To find out whether your baby has it, your doctor will need to perform a DNA test.

If your baby is born with Trisomy 18, he or she is at an elevated risk of passing it on to future generations through their offspring. However, you do not necessarily have to worry about passing down your child's Trisomy 18 disorder to your children. In fact, many people who carry trisomy 18 are healthy individuals. When combined with another chromosomal disorder called Kyphoscoliosis (which also affects newborns), you might be more prone to having a baby with Down syndrome than you think.


Q. My twin brother was born with normal eyesight, but my sister's eye color is blue. How does this happen?

Answer: As part of a rare phenomenon called mosaicism, both twins share several genes. These genes tend to act differently depending on how the two siblings were brought into the world. This variation usually manifests itself in different colors in each sibling. For example, white hands, fingers, ears, eyes, hair, and skin color are typical. But a black hand or finger bone could be white or",123,hypothyroidism symptoms,-12.239933013916016,134,multimedqa,6,0.8271604938271605,413,0
gpt2-large_107,"Yes, medication adhd anxiety (AAD) is diagnosed by the American Psychiatric Association in two subtypes. The first type is characterized by symptoms that develop gradually and are not relieved or corrected with treatment; the second type is characterized by an acute onset of symptoms followed by remission but subsequent relapse. To be considered AAD, patients must meet certain criteria. In both cases, patients may have comorbid psychiatric conditions such as mood disorders and substance abuse, which can interfere with medications, including those prescribed for ADHD. These conditions can also complicate the management of these symptoms.\n\n

Common Questions About ADHD \n

Answer: I don't think I am in the DSM-IV class. However, when someone has multiple diagnoses, they will often refer to their primary diagnosis in this answer. For example, if you were diagnosed with AAD and had a secondary diagnosis of bipolar disorder, then your primary diagnosis would include Bipolar Disorder. And even if you are now on medication, you might still need to take some additional tests before being able to be referred to the appropriate specialist. So, this question only applies to people who have been diagnosed with AAD.\n

Question: How do you get into the ""psychiatrist"" category?\nThe most important way that you can qualify is the fact that many doctors, including psychiatrists, feel that ADHD sufferers are self-medicating (self-treating), which can lead to depression or other mental illnesses. They believe that this behavior causes these behaviors to continue while there is no real cause. This belief makes it difficult to provide effective care. Many psychiatrists also feel that some patients with AAD have very high levels of impulsivity (as well as a general lack of focus). These patients tend to act quickly and without thinking, causing problems in social interactions and work.\n

Answer: The best evidence suggests that when adults are treated for ADHD, the underlying condition is actually better managed by treating the underlying cause rather than acting on what is seen as inappropriate behavior by the person. That's why we use the term ""overactive/inattentive."" That means that the problem should not be treated because it produces a symptom (such as hyperactivity) that does not exist until the person becomes overactive. It is easy for adults with ADHD to become frustrated with what is viewed as inappropriate behavior - so many parents report that if their child seems to have difficulties at school, there is no reason that he or she shouldn't be punished instead",107,medication adhd anxiety,-0.0510381460189819,0,multimedqa,6,0.0,409,6

1) How long does it usually take for an injection to work after being applied to skin? Does it need to be covered up while applying? If so, how often should we do this? Answer: An injection must not be exposed to sunlight or air for at least two hours. This means that when you apply an injection to the skin, it needs to remain covered until it has absorbed all of its contents into the skin. This can be difficult to achieve and requires the application of an oily substance such as Vaseline or Liquid Nails®. In addition, some injectable medications contain ingredients which can interact with other pharmaceuticals and irritate the skin. Therefore, even though the injected medication cannot come directly into contact with the surface of the skin, it still has to stay protected from outside elements. Some patients require immediate use of an antihistamine if they have allergies, asthma, sinusitis, or an underlying skin condition. However, most people who receive injections don't require more than a day or two of protection from allergens.

2) What happens when I miss an appointment because I am traveling? When missing appointments is due to travel, the patient must schedule an appointment as soon as possible after the scheduled date of the visit. After scheduling the appointment, the patient must call the clinic within 24 hours of returning home.

Answer: \N\The answer depends upon your age, sex, weight, activity level, current smoking habits, and other factors.

Your risk for type 2 diabetes increases if you smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol regularly. Also, if you are overweight, have high cholesterol levels, or suffer from diabetes complications such as heart disease or kidney failure. You should check your diabetes medication closely. If needed, your doctor may prescribe an additional diabetes drug to prevent the development of diabetes complications. This could be called metformin. You may not develop diabetes if you do not take metformin (see below). However, your doctor may recommend that you take metformin if you have had pancreatitis or other pancreatic disease and you are at higher risk for diabetes complications. Ask your doctor if this is recommended. Keep in mind that some patients who start taking metformin develop hypoglycemia before it has been shown to work and that treatment with metformin may result in side effects and withdrawal reactions. See the FDA Web site for full details.

Some doctors warn against all diabetics using metformin unless prescribed by a physician. If you decide to try metformin without consulting your doctor, you should continue to follow your doctor's instructions carefully. It takes several weeks for metformin to work and for its effect to wear off. The longer you use metformin, the greater the chance you will relapse and regain your pre-metformin weight. So make sure you know what dose of metformin is right for you, including how long you want to stay on it. As discussed above, you need to avoid high fat foods to reduce your risk for type 2 diabetes.

gpt2-large_57,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that affects the brain, spinal cord, immune system, and peripheral tissues. It is diagnosed with abnormal changes in white blood cells called neutrophils and other types of cells. This disorder results in fatigue, numbness, weakness, balance problems, joint pain, vision loss, cognitive problems, and difficulty swallowing. The disease also can affect how your muscles contract or relax. If you have MS, it may cause more symptoms than if you don't have the disease. Symptoms can include problems with memory, concentration, speech, movement, swallowing, and coordination. Treatment for MS includes medication, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and sometimes surgery. There are two main forms of treatment: drugs and home remedies. Drugs work by inhibiting the body's own production of certain chemicals known as cytokines. These chemical messengers help control inflammation during a flare-up of the disease or an infection. Some of these drugs are approved for use to treat other conditions, such as high cholesterol. Home remedies include herbs, minerals, vitamins, and natural therapies, including massage, acupuncture, aromatherapy, yoga, acupressure, chiropractic care, and chiropractic adjustments. You should always talk with your doctor before using any medicine or home remedy. Follow up appointments may be needed after you stop taking the drug.

What is the name of the disease? Complete Answer: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)

How many people have it? Complete Answer: More than 1 million Americans have MS, according to The National Institutes of Health, with more than 100,000 new cases diagnosed each year. About 15 percent of patients who don't respond to drugs develop symptoms after their second or third attack, usually within two years. In 2011, more than 5.5 million U.S. adults aged 50 and older had some form of MS, according to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).

How does it affect my body? Complete Answer: It affects every part of your body, including your eyes, brain and heart. In addition to muscle weakness, your joints may be stiffened, you might lose your ability to move parts of your body in bed, and you can experience numbness or tingling sensations. Your vision could become blurred, blurry or even double-vision. You might feel tired all day long, especially if you spend most days lying on your back or couch. Even when you're not sick, it's important that you rest daily because your immune system is constantly fighting off infections and other diseases. You may also need regular blood tests. If you don't do this regularly, your condition will worsen. It is also possible to get MS without being aware of it because it often goes undiagnosed until it becomes severe. People with MS may also suffer from fatigue, depression, low energy and loss of interest in sex. They may find it difficult to concentrate or work.

Are there any treatments available? There aren't any currently approved medications for MS. But several studies suggest that some types of treatment might improve symptoms of the disease. Some of these include diet changes, exercise and lifestyle modifications such as using an anti-inflammatory medication called folic acid, which has been shown to reduce inflammation caused by disease. Although no treatments specifically target the brain, researchers believe they could help reverse the damage done by the inflammatory response in MS. Some studies show that taking certain supplements, such as vitamin B12, might prevent cognitive decline in those who already have the illness.

Is it treatable? Not necessarily. Current therapies focus on reducing inflammation and relieving pain and stiffness in the legs and feet, but it isn't clear how effective they'll be over time. And although many doctors consider it a chronic disease, it is reversible once you've learned to control the signs and symptoms.",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-10.0031156539917,97,multimedqa,6,0.7293233082706767,411,2

The TRH secretes an important hormonal signal into your blood stream, which affects your thyroid hormone production. It has been suggested that increased concentrations of TRH can lead to symptoms of hypothyroidism.\nQuestion: How do I know if I am pregnant? Is it possible for me to be pregnant while taking this medication? Complete Answer: Yes. You should consult your doctor before beginning any new pregnancy regimen. Your doctor will determine whether you are likely to become pregnant during treatment with raloxifene. Some women take raloxifene as they get ready for their first menstrual period and then resume regular treatment with this medicine.

How does the drug interact with other drugs/medications? Complete Answer: Raloxifene does not affect the metabolism of many medications. If you use another drug or medication containing methylisothiazolinone, including prescription medicines, your body will metabolize the medication differently from how it would normally. When taking a combination of different medications or medications, the amount and type of raloxifene needed may vary. For example, combining aspirin and raloxifene may result in more or less side effects depending on your weight, age, gender, diabetes status, etc.",93,Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?,-0.4514214396476745,7,multimedqa,6,0.03535353535353535,267,14

Is there anything you can do to help me get my parents to allow me to have a copy of your book on the shelf in their library?\nAnswer: As far as I know, the only way to obtain a copy is by contacting the publisher directly.

I have been trying to find out more information about vaccines and the Gardasil vaccine since December 2007 when I received my first dose of Gardasil. My mother was very concerned when she learned what it was and how dangerous it was for her child, but unfortunately, nobody seemed to care. Now I am a full grown woman and I still want to hear from anybody who has had anything to do with vaccines ever. How many children have died because of Gardasil before it's gone into widespread use in America? What were the most important reasons why the government decided to introduce it? And why did it seem like it was going to be a slam dunk for public acceptance after its release? Why was it suddenly called ""one of the safest childhood vaccines""? There seems to be absolutely nothing positive to report about the vaccine except for one thing - its high rate of autism in young girls and boys. Does anyone else think that this story sounds ridiculous? It certainly sounds like something out of a science fiction movie. This type of stuff doesn't interest me.

gpt2-large_79,"Yes. \nQuestion: What is the difference between a catheter, a stent, or an artery blockage? Complete Answer: The answer depends on what it is that you want to do with your patient and how serious the problem may be.\nIf the patient has a clot in his or her blood vessel, a catheter is inserted into the vein near the clot to block the flow of blood. If this was done successfully for 10 minutes, there would not be any bleeding involved. If this was done for longer than 10 minutes, you might need to cut open the vessel with a small scalpel or needle. An arterial blockage occurs when a blockage exists in one or more arteries, usually through a vein. This can be caused by heart attack, stroke, infection, or surgery. In most cases, a blockage is repaired with a stent. A stent must be placed carefully so as not to damage nearby nerves. After removing the blockage from the artery, an artery blockage usually returns within 12 hours if the patient does not have any other problems with their blood vessels. With all forms of blockages, however, at least two days should elapse before any further treatment is given. In rare situations, like when they become infected, patients will require more time.\nQuestion: Why is it necessary to perform a vasectomy? Complete Answer: Vasectomies can be performed only after a male is sure he is sterile. It takes some research and careful planning to know whether an intact man is a good match for a woman who wants children, and whether a baby born to such a couple could survive outside of its mother's womb without being affected by the sperm and egg cells that made up the woman's body. Because of these factors, many doctors do not consider vasectomy a viable option for couples seeking to produce healthy offspring. Women who have had vasectomies are less likely to get pregnant after having a child because of this restriction.\nQuestions: How can I tell the gender of my unborn child? Complete Answer: When a fetus becomes visible, the color, shape, and size change. Sometimes a single dot appears on each side of the head, sometimes four dots appear on both sides of the head, and sometimes five or six dots appear on either side. If the infant looks female, it is probably a boy. If it resembles a doll or a pig, then it is probably a girl. If it is purple or blue, it is probably a boy.

\e This article is intended for the general public and does not deal with specific medical issues.\nQuestion: what causes cataracts? Complete Answer: The primary cause of cataract formation is an abnormal crystallization of the lens in response to light exposure. There are two main types of crystallizations - one that occurs as a result of increased use of contact lenses or eye drops, and another that occurs by direct sunlight. Both kinds of crystallization can be treated successfully with prescription glasses, but it's important to note that both conditions tend to improve over time.\nQuestion: what causes glaucoma? Complete Answer: Glaucoma develops from accumulation of extra blood vessels in the brain that lead to changes in how oxygen enters and leaves the body. A combination of factors including genetics, smoking, obesity, and diabetes are thought to contribute to its development. It typically progresses rapidly and requires immediate treatment. Most people who develop glaucoma eventually get better without any intervention other than surgery.\nQuestion: what causes hyperthyroidism (hyper thyroxin)? Complete Answer: Hyperthyroidism is caused by excessive amounts of thyroid hormone produced in excess of normal production levels in your body. As such, you will have elevated levels of thyroid hormones in your urine. Your doctor may order tests to determine if you are underactive or overactive. If you believe you are underactive, see your doctor immediately because treatment options include lowering thyroid levels through medication, radiation therapy, or radioactive iodine therapy. If you suspect that you are overactive, however, there are treatments available that might help. For example, some supplements may help decrease your TSH levels and lower your thyroid hormones.\nQuestion: what causes benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)? Complete Answer: BPH is a condition where your glands become enlarged and more likely to produce too much testosterone, which can increase the risk of prostate cancer. In men, this increases the risk for kidney stones and endometriosis, among many other problems. Unfortunately, most doctors do not know why some men experience symptoms similar to those listed here, so they don't prescribe the correct dosage of hormone replacement. In some cases, medications can reverse symptoms and make them go away.

Complete Answer: An estimated 15% of adults will suffer some kind of heart problem at one point in their lives; however, most of these conditions eventually resolve on their own and there is no known cause for heart disease. In addition, up to 90% of all heart attacks occur during the first four years after menopause and women who start smoking before age 40 are more than twice as likely as non-smokers to develop heart failure at any time. \nQuestion: what's wrong with my baby? Complete Answer: There are two primary reasons why your child might not thrive in early life:

1) The mother was exposed to toxic substances by her diet, causing an increase in thyroid hormones, which may lead to infertility or other problems 2) Your infant has had surgery to correct birth defects. This may also lead to issues related to poor nutrition, especially if this type of operation occurs soon after birth. You should speak with your doctor before making major decisions concerning your child. \nQuestion: How does pregnancy work? Complete Answer: The human body begins to form a fertilized egg at approximately 17 weeks. After implantation, it takes only six days for the embryo to reach its full size, which happens when it's born through a small hole in the wall of the uterus. During the next few weeks, you'll experience an intense series of contractions and contractions will continue until delivery. At this point, a placenta attaches to the uterine wall and becomes attached to the developing fetus. Within three months, the fetus is ready to expel the amniotic sac, which provides oxygen to the pregnant woman. To make matters worse, the fetus cannot fully absorb nutrients from the maternal blood stream without also absorbing them from the umbilical cord. The resulting low birth weight results in high rates of preterm labor and premature birth.

In fact, most Americans get too little calcium from their food supply. In addition, consuming excess amounts of refined sugar is also a concern for bone health, since it raises blood pressure, increases insulin levels and encourages weight gain.

The USDA recommends eating at least one serving (two servings) of fruit every day, and drinking six glasses of water per day if you're going to be exercising regularly. Vegetables, beans, nuts, seeds, grains and legumes are good choices as well. For more information on vegetables, see this site.

Most healthy diets include fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grain products, fish and meat, eggs, dairy products and protein-rich foods such as nuts, seeds and soy.

To minimize your risks of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes and cancer, eat a balanced diet with a variety of meats, seafood, poultry and other proteins. Choose lean meats over fatty ones because these tend to have less saturated fats and cholesterol than red meat and chicken; choose lean seafood over fatty tuna because it's high in omega-3s. And avoid fried foods and packaged meals, which can contain added sugars and other unhealthy ingredients.

gpt2-large_53,"Psychotherapy (also known as psychoanalysis) is a process in which the individual actively participates in his/her own healing process with a therapist, usually by seeking out information, listening to it or talking through questions that may arise during treatment. In addition to providing factual, objective information on an issue related to one's life, psychoanalysis can provide emotional support, insight into inner problems, and insight into how other people see themselves and their lives. It can help people understand their feelings and thoughts so they don't get caught up in them and prevent harmful self-destructive behaviors. It also helps people make sense of events and situations without being led astray by emotions or beliefs. When using psychoanalysis, one needs to be sensitive to people's reactions and needs. People have different reasons for wanting to seek psychological counseling from you; some may need to talk about significant personal issues that they feel uncomfortable discussing publicly.

Pain relief usually requires a combination of opioid analgesics such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen and nonopioid prescription drugs like morphine, oxycodone, and hydrocodone.

gpt2-large_126,"A. The number of follicles that produce an egg is called the follicular unit size (FUS). The FUS may be from as low as 1/10 to as high as 10/20 in volume. B. During ovulation the body produces more androgen hormones than it can use, or any amount of estrogen. In the presence of these excess hormones, the ovary cannot release enough eggs for fertilization. Therefore, each time an egg comes out of the ovary there will be a negative feedback loop where the hormone production goes down while the follicle counts go up. This process has been known since ancient times. However, because of the lack of accurate information available, many women have mistakenly believed that they do not need treatment for this condition. This misinformation often occurs because some physicians think that the ""normal"" level of fertility is 25 to 30 percent when in fact it can range anywhere between 20 to 50 percent if the patient does not take any other medications such as medication for diabetes or hypertension. It would help if all women understood how important it is for them to know their fertility status. In addition, it would be beneficial if providers could provide patients with an accurate chart showing the follicular units produced during various phases of their menstrual cycles, including peak folliculogenesis (the second part of ovulation), and regular menstrual cycle fluctuations. These charts should also include a monthly average value so that the patient can determine whether his or her fertility levels are normal or abnormal. Answer: C. Yes. If a woman is diagnosed with OCS she has the option to undergo hysterectomy or anovulatory surgery. Some doctors believe that the majority of patients who have a problem with oocyte maturation at the end of their second cycle actually have no problems at all with the first cycle. Therefore, they recommend that a woman who is ovulating on the last day of her first cycle start taking oral contraceptives and then begin using oral contraceptives again after three weeks until her next period. For a woman whose ovaries are very sensitive, this plan might result in a total hysterectomy. Other doctors prefer to wait a few months to see how much the ovarian follicles enlarge. Once the enlarged follicles have reached 2 mm in diameter, a second round of oral contraceptive use might be advised.

Complete Answer: Anaphylaxis refers to an immediate allergic response to something in the environment; it can also involve a mild reaction that takes place over time with little if any impact on those who have been exposed to the object. Symptoms include skin burning, wheezing, hives, difficulty breathing, chest tightness, swelling, flushing, swelling around the eyes, throat, nose and mouth, and shortness of breath. The first signs of an allergic reaction include hives, sore lips and a runny nose. Your doctor will likely recommend a course of medication based on the severity of your reactions.

One theory is if you eat certain foods, especially fruits or vegetable juices, that may contain large amounts of bile salts called bilirubin. Bilirubin causes the urine to become acidic, leading to further urination of stones. Another theory is that certain environmental factors can trigger kidney damage in IBD sufferers. This could occur at any time of day. Many patients suffering from IBD have suffered both kidney problems as well as other gastrointestinal issues such as bloating and gas.

You may also find our information in print or online, with reference numbers included at each end. We believe there is no single answer to this question. In general, healthy eating has been shown to reduce the risk of developing many chronic diseases including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, depression, osteoarthritis, arthritis and even death. Healthy food choices often help patients lose weight or maintain good physical condition while helping them avoid the need to use medication, improve their diets and make lifestyle changes. Your personal experiences will influence what foods you choose to eat and how often you consume them. Some people choose to limit their calories; others eat large amounts of carbohydrates. Others prefer a low fat diet. Most importantly, everyone knows exactly what foods they should and shouldn't eat. When it comes to eating unhealthy foods, not only are we doctors, we are also nutritionists, public health specialists.


What kind of treatment should I receive for my disorder?\nPartner: An appropriate diagnosis must come from a qualified expert in the field, like a neurologist, psychiatrist, psychiatrist, psychologist, family therapist, etc. A specialist's specialty may include MS, and even other disorders such as ADD/ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), anxiety and depression. It can take a long time before a diagnosis occurs. Also, a lot depends upon how serious your illness is. If you're having trouble sleeping, don't wait until things get better. Make changes to your life right away to decrease the chance of returning to your previous level of functioning. Be sure you have a plan and stick to it. Ask for free advice from us before making any decisions that could impact your well being.

1) Inhibiting estrogen production by the liver or ovaries.


2) Reducing the number of estrogens produced by the body through the use of hormone therapy.


3) Estrogen replacement therapy (hRT).


4) Using oral contraceptives such as the Pill.


5) Increasing exposure to ultraviolet light which can increase levels of free radicals in cells.


6) Treating patients with radiation therapy.


7) Increasing the amount of bile acids produced in the digestive tract so they can be used for digestion.


8) Decreasing the amount of cholesterol produced by the body.


9) Combining HRT and aspirin. \nThe most effective way to decrease your risk of getting triple negative breast cancer is to reduce your intake of fats. Fat does not cause breast cancer. It is the type of fat found in animal foods such as butter and cream, oils, and some margarines that causes the cancer. The fat that causes the cancer is cholesterol and has no relation to the amount of saturated fat found in foods and beverages. The only thing you should avoid is using animal products containing meat or any other types of fatty animals. There is no evidence to suggest that eating an egg increases your risk of getting triple negative breast cancer.

This will help to prevent future recurrence of breast cancer. You may need additional surgery at some point if the cancer has spread to adjacent sites. Your surgeon must decide whether or not you need additional surgical procedures to control the disease and prevent further recurrences. For this reason, it is important that you discuss your options with your surgeon before beginning treatment. 4) A biopsy, a procedure where tissue samples are taken from inside of your chest to see the extent of the tumor. 5) Radiation therapy.

You can take a course on the diagnosis and treatment of MS or you can take one on personal care related topics such as diet, exercise, smoking cessation, and stress management. A second class is also available that covers the prevention and care for people with MS. \nQuestion: What is the difference between MS and MS-related disability?\nAnswer: When it comes to the distinction between MS and MS-related disability, there isn't much of a distinction at all because these terms refer to different conditions or disorders. The two most commonly used terms are: \/ disease \/disability. For example, someone may have a ""mild"" form of MS (like Parkinson's) but be classified as having a severe form (such as Lou Gehrig's disease). In general, the number of symptoms and symptoms associated with any condition will define its severity (e.g., mild disability can include walking problems, hearing loss, and vision difficulties), and the person with MS or MS-related disability would be more likely than someone without the disorder to exhibit significant functional limitations. Many patients with MS have no detectable physical features or clinical signs; they just have trouble staying healthy. Their disability may be due to other factors including immune system abnormalities (immune thrombocytopenia); damage to their nervous systems from strokes, infections, injuries, or radiation exposure; mental retardation; or some combination thereof. Asking an individual to choose between two words - disease and disability - leaves them feeling confused. It doesn't make sense. If they were asked to do so, we know what we'd recommend: \/ disease. We believe that MS is very similar to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), which was first described over 30 years ago. Both diseases share many of the same underlying pathophysiology and have a similar incidence, severity, and comorbidity. Both disease and disability can involve a wide range of symptoms; however, the differences among the two conditions are important to consider when diagnosing and managing the individuals affected by MS. To help clarify the distinctions between disease and disability, here are a few examples of different types of symptom clusters and some key characteristics that each has in common: \/ Disease cluster 1 : Sleep disturbances

2 : Difficulty concentrating

3 : Poor appetite or loss of appetite

4 : Mood changes

5 : Dizziness, lightheadedness, and weakness",81,Can I work and study full-time with multiple sclerosis?,-0.6278343796730042,4,multimedqa,7,0.0182648401826484,401,25
gpt2-large_77,"Many symptoms of MS are associated with the onset of the menstrual cycle (menstrual cramps, dysmenorrhea, premenstrual syndrome, and amenorrhea). These symptoms may be due in part to changes in hormone levels during this time period. But others may also occur as menarche occurs. Women who suffer from MS should be aware that many of these symptoms can overlap with the symptoms experienced by women suffering from other chronic illnesses. For instance, it is possible for some women to have MS without experiencing any or all of the above symptoms. A number of studies have shown that when you include an illness on your list of conditions, you are more likely to respond positively to treatment for it than if you simply skip over it.\nQuestion: What treatments might help me stop having symptoms after I've been diagnosed with MS? \nAnswer: You need to make a decision before treatment begins. Some patients will feel better immediately after starting treatment. Others may require at least several months, perhaps years, of treatment before they no longer experience symptoms. The goal of treatment is usually not to cure MS but rather to minimize disability. So it's important that you work closely with your doctor and pay close attention to what he says about treating each symptom separately. Also, make sure you understand how long treatment is going to take and when you must stop taking medication. It's important to note that because MS affects so many people, there are many different types of MS. Sometimes the symptoms of MS are severe enough that you'll need to go through therapy. Other times the symptoms will seem manageable, even tolerable, until treatment ends. In addition, other factors, such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, or family history, could affect whether treatment works for you.

The American Heart Association states that 10% of Americans will die from some form of heart attack in their lifetime, while 20% of Americans will die from some form of kidney failure in their lifetime. \nQuestion: How do I get help with an illness when I am alone without anyone else around me to talk with? Do you think that having a doctor who is sympathetic to my situation would make it easier? Complete Answer: It depends on what kind of physician you want to seek help with. If you want to see a specialist, your primary care physician could be the best place to start looking. He or she should be able to give you some recommendations and perhaps refer you to a specialized facility if needed.\nQuestion: Can you recommend any treatment options or drugs for treating my condition, such as pain management? Complete Answer: Pain relief is possible by medications or physical therapy. There are also a variety of alternatives to traditional medical practices, including acupuncture, herbal therapies, homeopathy, chiropractic techniques, and massage techniques. In addition, there are alternative health practitioners who work closely with the patients and offer the patient-oriented services of a holistic approach. \nQuestion: When I was at the hospital where I received emergency treatment, I noticed a nurse wearing a black dress. Was this uniform required during my medical stay? Is the black dress part of the standard uniform of a hospital worker? Complete Answer: No, nurses in hospitals wear uniforms only under special circumstances. Nurses are often seen on the hospital floor, assisting and supervising physicians in administering medication, performing surgeries, and caring for patients. Nurse uniforms vary depending on their location and the type of hospital they serve. \nQuestion: What are the differences between the types of treatments available in the United States and abroad for chronic illnesses? Complete Answer: Each country has its own methods of treating certain chronic ailments. Some countries use the principles of natural medicine to treat diseases; others focus more on science-based treatments. For example, in Japan, doctors apply heat and cold to treat diabetes; in France, the same procedure is used but doctors administer a different brand of insulin. And so on.

gpt2-large_62,"Your response can help your employer understand the importance of disclosure to their workforce.\nQuestion: How do I know if my employer is giving me an equal opportunity for employment? Is it true that employers often give preference to women over men when making hiring decisions? Are they also required to provide them with all the benefits offered by their company? Complete Answer: The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has established clear guidelines on who should be eligible for employment based on sexual orientation. For example, a male employee in the U.S. is considered gay/lesbian only if he or she was sexually attracted to someone of the same sex or ""same gender."" However, employers may consider applicants' ability to perform a variety of jobs within the company without regard to sexual orientation as a factor in determining which candidates will receive consideration. A company's decision about whether or not to employ an applicant based on sexual orientation does not automatically bar the application from being considered by other companies seeking to hire employees. Employees who wish to make discrimination claims against their employers must first file a charge with the EEOC within three years of the date of the discrimination. When you have filed your charge, the EEOC will investigate it to determine whether there is enough evidence to prove a violation of federal law. This investigation typically involves an interview with both the complainant and respondent, with the complaint then going through several stages of review before finally reaching an official determination. If the agency finds reasonable cause, the agency will refer the case to the Department of Justice, and an enforcement action could result. Please note that some states require an employer to offer free sexual reassignment surgery to employees who want one after receiving a letter stating their need for such treatment. Although this requirement does not prohibit discrimination, it prevents the employee from getting medical care that they might otherwise get because they don't have insurance coverage for it. Federal law requires employers to let employees who are transgender change their name and gender marker on all documents, including birth certificates, passports, and driver licenses. In addition, employers may refuse to allow any person to use restrooms that correspond to the gender on their legal identification. Allowing a man to enter a woman's bathroom would violate Title IX, but denying a woman access to the ladies room would also likely violate Title VII. Finally, although a single individual's decision regarding his or her own gender identity may be best left to that individual alone, an organization's nondiscrimination policies should reflect the diversity of its membership, regardless of gender identity.

gpt2-large_35,"A ketogenic diet is not suitable for people with type 1 diabetes (the most common form of the disease). While it has been used successfully in some individuals with type 1 diabetes, other factors such as the body's natural response to insulin resistance and an individual's genetic makeup make this approach extremely difficult to apply across all types of patients. The best alternative for these individuals would be to avoid eating carbohydrates altogether, relying on foods that contain high amounts of protein or fat but do not have as much glycemic index (GI) values (meaning there is no spike in blood sugar levels when eaten). For more information see our Ketogenic Diet FAQs. \nQuestions: Is a low carb diet suitable for me? Complete Answer: Low carbohydrate diets are generally not suitable for people with type 2 diabetes who are taking medication that affects their pancreas. Although some studies have shown that the effects of low carbohydrate diets can be temporary, the majority of evidence indicates that they will lead to weight loss, even if these diets continue to cause gastrointestinal issues, liver damage, poor hormone function, and potentially worse health outcomes down the line. In addition, unlike some low carb diets which use lots of carbs (over 100 grams per day), a low carb diet that uses very few carbohydrates may actually result in a higher intake of calories than your body needs for healthy functioning. Therefore, while most doctors recommend that you limit your overall calorie intake to 1000 calories per day for everyone over the age of 40, this does not mean you need to go below 500 calories per day for those over 40 years old. In fact, many older adults should consume between 750 – 900 calories per day, depending on how active they are. However, it's always important to keep in mind the following important points before making any dietary changes: A low carb diet is different from low fat diets, so it's crucial to check out what your doctor recommends before you try anything new.

It takes time for a person's metabolism to adjust to reduced food intake and increased activity.

A person should eat large meals regularly to maintain good energy balance.

It is normal to develop the look of old age as our bodies do not produce new lenses at the same rate. While this does not mean that all will become blind, most would like to see better because it makes their lives easier and provides them with greater comfort. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends that people older than 65 be tested periodically for vision problems. For example, when considering whether to wear corrective lenses, consider factors such as age and eye disease severity. If you experience blurred vision after wearing glasses, you should try replacing the lens with one that allows clearer light and more natural color perception. You might want to consult with a licensed optometrist before taking any action. In addition to glasses, most adults with severe visual impairment should use artificial vision devices. These can provide better vision in low light conditions but they are often expensive and difficult to purchase.

Head pats may also be used to treat various other conditions such as eczema and psoriasis, lupus erythematosus, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), osteoarthritis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), asthma, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome/chronic constipation, and more. These problems can often be treated by using other methods of hair removal including scalp flaps, bandanas, and a variety of products such as shampoo, conditioner, gel, and waxes.

What does the term ""head lice"" mean?


The term ""head louse"" refers to an adult animal bite from a biting insect known as the European corn beetle, Neisseria meningitidis (European white bee). It was originally classified as a parasitic infestation because it could cause death when its eggs were ingested. However, over time, scientists determined that the larvae of the insect were actually developing within the host. Scientists believe that the larvae develop from the egg shells of a few species of bees throughout the world. There are two main subspecies in North America: European corn borer (Cynomastix europeanum) and Mexican corn borer (M. nigripes). While both of these pests live in warm temperate regions where they prefer to lay their eggs. They feed primarily on corn, soybean, peanuts, tree nuts, and fruit, but will attack almost anything else that fits their diet. During their larval stage, the adults form protective cocoons under leaves, twigs, and debris. In addition to attacking and killing the larvae, the adults also eat any nits or insects that come in contact with them while feeding. Because of their predatory nature, no type of protection is needed against these aggressive pests",132,headpats scalp psoriasis,-0.0199484545737504,0,multimedqa,7,0.0,369,1

gpt2-large_102,"\n\nWhat is the most likely cause of my eczema?\nAnswer:\n\nMost people with eczema have not been diagnosed by your doctor. They may be suffering from something called erythema multiforme or atopic dermatitis. The skin of someone with eczema tends to develop lesions that look like bumps or rashes on their forehead, neck, cheeks, legs, arms, hands, feet, and face (called atypical features). These lesions can also appear elsewhere in the body as well. Although you can't be 100% sure if you've got an allergic reaction, it's quite possible you will.\n\nIf you have eczema, it's probably the result of having too many substances living inside your body that don't belong there, including the following:\n\n• Eczema has nothing to do with allergies.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of eczema are all related to the immune system's response to foreign objects called allergens.\n\nThere are two kinds of allergies:\n\n1. Allergic contact dermatitis\n2. Anaphylaxis.\n\nAllergies to certain things cause itching, redness, swelling, and other symptoms. If you have these kinds of reactions, they're often caused by an overactive immune system. People with eczema usually react more strongly to things that irritate them than to others. For example, they might scratch themselves when they itch. In addition, even small amounts of dirt and oil can trigger an allergic reaction. When the immune system doesn't get enough oxygen, it starts producing chemicals called histamines, which activate the same parts of the brain that produce histamine. Histamines are the key ingredients in food poisoning. That means that when you eat an allergy-causing substance like moldy bread or a piece of burnt butter, you're putting yourself right back at risk for getting sick. Most adults who suffer from eczema have experienced some form of allergic contact dermatitis during childhood. Some children have had serious allergic reactions to things such as nuts, peanuts, and eggs. Your child may need special treatment because he or she has eczema.

Answer: Most women experience little, if any, negative impact upon their fertility levels following menopause, so there is no reason to worry about becoming pregnant again. However, a woman should consider her options carefully before giving birth.\nQuestion: what are the risks of having twins?\nAnswer: Although the benefits of twin pregnancies outweigh the risks, these two births pose unique concerns. Twinning is rare and the consequences are unpredictable. Each child carries both genetic material and an increased chance of transmitting the disease. Some women who get twins may develop serious problems such as chromosomal abnormalities, heart defects, eye problems, kidney failure, and respiratory issues.

gpt2-large_63,"Yes. The risk of MS is higher in people who have had previous relapses or MS, which can lead to complications such as disability or even death. However, no serious permanent damage occurs from MS, and MS often goes away on its own without treatment. In addition, the disease's effects are generally temporary; the onset does not occur until several years after symptoms begin (and sometimes before any signs or symptoms present). So long as you do not have active MS, your chances for a prolonged or chronic course are low. Although some people with MS recover completely or may have some improvements after their first relapse, these are rare. If you develop MS again, you should seek professional care. Treatment for recurrent MS is similar to that of primary MS except that treatment usually involves medications and lifestyle changes rather than surgery. It is best if you first visit your doctor at least two months prior to starting any new medication. Many other illnesses cause similar problems to MS: for example, cancer, asthma, diabetes, arthritis, heart disease, sleep disorders, migraine headaches, and many others. Some of these conditions also appear to be associated with increased odds of MS, but they are not directly related to the condition itself. As an additional precaution, it is important to ask if there is another condition that might be causing your symptoms that may also increase your risk. This will help ensure that you receive the appropriate medical attention if your physician determines you need one.

In summary, MS appears to be relatively benign, especially compared to most of the other diseases, so long as you don't have current MS. While this information should provide relief to those suffering from MS, it certainly doesn't change the fact that we all suffer from other illnesses and conditions. And as always, you must take your own actions to ensure good health.",63,Will multiple sclerosis affect my career?,-3.7756187915802,129,multimedqa,7,0.516,316,1

Short-Term Effects

Longer term effects of MS can be more severe, such as loss of motor skills and coordination, numbness or tingling in the arms and legs, trouble speaking, difficulty with swallowing, muscle weakness, blurred vision, cognitive impairment, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, increased risk for serious infections, and even death. These long term effects also include a greater chance that you will get cancer. For example, if you live in an area where the rate of MS is high enough to increase your risk of developing cancers, you may want to consider getting treatment early (for example, taking antibiotics after an infection).


It is important to recognize what you should do when these long-term effects occur. The most appropriate course of action depends on the severity and time elapsed between the onset of symptoms and your doctor's diagnosis of MS. You need to determine whether you might benefit from some form of therapy or disease prevention. If there is no effective treatment available, or if you would like to try alternative therapies, discuss these options with your physician. Your doctor can recommend complementary or alternative treatments based on their proven effectiveness, safety, and cost.

How Can I Treat Myself?

To help prevent further complications from MS, many people prefer to avoid surgery altogether. But there are a few options that can make a difference. There is currently no cure for MS but there are several ways to reduce symptoms over time and slow down the progression of the disease. Treatment may consist of medications, lifestyle changes, exercise, and sometimes rehabilitation programs. However, the best way to treat yourself is by learning all the techniques and tools available so that you can use them effectively to manage your MS symptoms better.

gpt2-large_54,"Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS). It is characterized by inflammation of blood vessels in your brain, spinal cord, lymph nodes, and nerves. The inflammation causes changes within cells, including myelin sheath, which provides structural insulation between nerve fibers and helps them conduct electrical signals. \nAnswer: If you have MS, then yes, it changes your life. This disorder involves abnormal formation of scar tissue around the edges of nerve endings throughout your body, causing paralysis or loss of sensation in affected areas. In many cases, the disease progresses slowly and requires intensive treatment, such as surgery, radiation therapy, and daily medication. However, in some people with MS, symptoms can progress rapidly or appear suddenly after the initial attack. You may notice a decrease in strength and coordination at first. As time goes on, you may also experience joint pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, muscle spasms, seizures, loss of vision, hearing, and balance problems. Treatment typically includes several steps: medications; diet adjustments; physical therapy and speech therapy; and home and community activities such as exercise and social support groups. \nAnother important question is what types of treatments are available for this disorder. There are two main categories of therapies. Most commonly used are anti-inflammatory drugs (such as NSAIDs), calcium channel blockers, and other forms of neuroprotective agents such as benzodiazepines and antidepressants. Other options include genetic counseling, lifestyle modifications, and education to help you learn more about MS. All of these methods will take time and effort to accomplish successfully, so it's best to find out about all your options in advance. Many doctors don't know much about MS until they've treated their own patients. They do not yet understand how different types of therapies work and if any should be tried before going back to someone else. For example, it could be wise to seek advice from a doctor who has treated MS before in order to get a feel for the kind of results he/she gets when treating patients with similar conditions. Also ask to see a report from a neurologist before starting a new drug regimen or having your existing therapy changed.\nQuestion: How long does it take me to recover from MS?

What is holistic medicine and what does it include?

Healthcare professionals use the term ""holistic"" to refer to all aspects of health and disease management that are not primarily focused on symptoms or diseases alone. For example, ""holistic"" also includes nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress management, mental well being, and more. Question: How does holistic health work?\nAnswer: The concept of holistic health can be broadly categorized into four main areas: homeopathy, herbalism, naturopathy, and integrative medicine.\nHomeopathic remedies (drugs designed to help heal specific illnesses) may also be used by physicians for other ailments. In addition, certain natural products (e.g., vitamins, minerals, herbs), as well as dietary supplements (such as fish oil and omega-3 fatty acids) have been shown to contain significant amounts of beneficial compounds called antioxidants. \nHerbalists believe that healthy lifestyles help maintain a balance in the body's antioxidant enzymes; however, many modern-day treatments for chronic illnesses such as cancer rely heavily on these same antioxidants. Naturopathic practitioners believe that the healing properties of plants and medicines should be incorporated into the treatment process with regular administration to reduce side effects. \nIntegrative medicine combines conventional and complementary therapies based on scientific principles. Many integrators believe that this form of treatment is much more effective than traditional treatments because they combine traditional treatments with new, emerging ones that target multiple systems. Traditional health approaches tend to focus on symptom reduction through diet, exercise, sleep, stress relief, and medication. But when combined with current research findings showing how the body processes and responds to specific drugs and foods, integrators have been able to develop highly effective strategies to combat chronic conditions like cancer and heart disease. \nQuestion: What are some examples of homeopathic remedies?\nAnswers: Most homeopaths and herbalists recommend using one of two main types of remedy: homeopathic decoction or homeopathic infusion.\nDecoctions are prepared drinks made from ingredients similar to those found in nature, such as dried herbs, roots, leaves, bark, flowers, and spices. They're usually diluted 1:1 or 2:1. Decoctions are often recommended",51,What is holistic medicine and what does it include?,-0.0087188752368092,0,multimedqa,7,0.0,374,32

The person displays erratic mood swings that last a few hours at most or can be severe enough to cause substantial disruption in life. For example, one man who had been hospitalized for depression developed manic episodes within weeks. He also showed signs of depression in his interactions with friends and family members. Another woman exhibited marked anxiety and depression during her pregnancy. She was extremely stressed, unable to sleep, and anxious all day long. During this period she became very hostile toward people and often acted out violently against them. \nQuestion: how much pain does it take to kill someone? Complete Answer: The amount of pain required to cause death from an overdose is unknown but ranges between 20% and 40%.\nQuestion: what is the definition of insanity? Complete Answer: In America, insanity is defined as being without understanding of right and wrong, the difference between good and evil, or even a rational thought process. It must be determined by two or three witnesses who agree on whether the defendant's actions were voluntary, involuntary, and immoral. This standard will vary depending upon the state laws. For instance, if there is evidence of prior mental illness and the defendant has not received treatment, it would still need to meet these criteria. In cases where the act occurred while under psychiatric care or when the defendant did not know he had become mentally ill, mental retardation, or intellectual disability, the statute of limitations is usually extended. In addition, you should also check your local statutes regarding the crime of murder.\nQuestion: what is the legal term for a heart attack? Complete Answer: A heart attack is a sudden failure of the heart's pumping power resulting in a loss of blood flow to the body. When the heart stops beating, blood pressure falls, causing irregular heartbeats. If left untreated, a fatal heart attack could result. Although a heart attack can happen anywhere in the body, they occur most frequently in young adults (age 20 to 34) because they have less physical strength and muscle control than older patients. As mentioned above, the degree of severity varies significantly according to the patient's age, medical condition, age at onset, and other factors. \nWhat are the causes of heart attacks? Complete Answer: There is no single cause of heart disease. Heart damage occurs from several sources. Factors such as smoking, obesity, diabetes, excess stress, poor diet, high cholesterol levels, low iron levels, poor exercise habits",114,borderline personality disorder symptoms,-8.063875198364258,63,multimedqa,7,0.5833333333333334,428,0
gpt2-large_85,"This is the classic relapsing remitter, or RMR. People who have been diagnosed with MS for at least six months may have periods of improvement in their symptoms, but relapse rates tend to be high. While there is no specific cure, many doctors recommend medication to control the disease. At the same time, research shows that most patients will never fully recover from MS, even when they take medications. For this reason, a person should not be considered cured until he or she has completely recovered from an active MS attack. \nQuestion: Heart problems and other cardiovascular issues. Complete Answer: These conditions can affect the heart's ability to pump blood around its body. If your heart condition does make it difficult to breathe (for example, if you have a blocked coronary artery), then you may need to adjust the amount of oxygen delivered to your lungs as well as to your bloodstream. You also may need special precautions to keep your airway open while breathing to prevent aspiration, which could cause blockage of the lung wall. There are drugs available to treat these conditions, and some people experience benefits after starting them. But taking any drug, including those prescribed by your doctor, without first talking to your physician can lead to serious side effects. Your doctor will discuss any concerns you might have with respect to these medicines with you before recommending them. For more information on treating these conditions, see the Medication Guide for Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Management.

Appendix A - Summary of Questions Asked in 2012 Question: Is it true that I can only go home once every 30 days? Complete Answer: No. Most people who visit hospital emergency rooms are admitted because they are unable to care for themselves and cannot leave quickly enough. Some people have difficulty getting out of bed in the morning and staying awake all night long. Others find it hard to eat, exercise, or perform basic tasks such as moving heavy objects like shopping carts or shopping bags. As you age, changes to your body and brain that result from treatment can put some people at risk of complications during surgery or other procedures. However, many people are able to get through the day by managing their symptoms well. \nQuestion: When my body is feeling tired, do I feel better and do I just go back to sleep? Complete Answer: Yes.

Some forms of therapy, such as anti-inflammatory medications, are available only at a doctor's office. Other types of therapy require regular monitoring and/or follow up visits.

Complete Answer: Technology has become very advanced over the past 10 years. However, as a physician, I am concerned that advancements will lead us away from basic science practices. For example, we no longer treat infections through traditional means, such as penicillin, because antibiotic resistance has developed. We now use drugs to target specific bacterial populations or promote their growth within the patient's body. Some patients may be able to tolerate some therapies for several weeks before they are required to return to surgery.\nQuestion: Are there any special tips you can give people looking into becoming a doctor who wants to take up medicine? Complete Answer: No. However, if you want to pursue a career in medicine as an optometrist, it might be worth studying anatomy at university. You could choose to specialize in this area so that you can practice before moving onto other specialties. If you find yourself drawn toward a career in clinical psychology or clinical social work, then consider that another profession can also provide benefits in this field. In addition, many professional organizations, including the American Medical Association and the American Psychological Association have formal policies that make it clear that psychologists need not be licensed to practice medicine.

For children less than 5 years old, 400 mcg of VZV vaccine can be given with no adverse effects in an unvaccinated child as long as he/she is not allergic to the vaccine; however, this dose should only be used if other treatment options have been exhausted. The following information has been gathered from CDC's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and provides basic information on reported events and potential safety concerns related to the use of VZV vaccines. However, it does not necessarily reflect the actual experience of healthcare providers dealing with these issues. For more detailed information regarding VZV vaccine reactions and treatment considerations see http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety.

What are the possible side effects of the Covid-19 vaccine?

The most common reports indicate that symptoms may include fever, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and red eyes. Other side effects such as skin rashes, joint pain, and even death have also occurred. In addition to these reported events, serious complications were observed in some cases when severe adverse events were linked to the administration of VZV vaccine (see Table 1).

gpt2-large_116,"This question is related to the one above, but does not directly address whether the presence of prostate cancer in your family has any effect on your chances of developing the disease. The answer depends on many factors, such as age at diagnosis, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity level, family history, social class, and genetic information. In general, men with more than one diagnosed disease tend to have lower mortality rates than those who do not have cancer. For example, only 2% of men in the oldest age group without prostate cancer had the disease when they died, compared with 15% of men over 75 years old with prostate cancer.\nOther causes of death also differ by time period:\nMen younger than 55 were twice as likely to die from coronary heart disease as were older men, while men 65 or older were 1.5 times as likely to die from cardiovascular diseases. Overall, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced among all ages and for both sexes by several decades after diagnosis.\nQuestion: breast cancer\nComplete Answer: Yes, you may have been misdiagnosed for breast cancer (false positive) or treated wrongly (false negative). It is possible that some cases may be misclassified, which could affect your odds of recovery. Also, it's important to note that if the test results come back abnormal, it would indicate that there was no cancer present at diagnosis; that is, it might be a false positive result. It can also be difficult to accurately estimate the true risk of recurrence of a previously undiagnosed disease. If the patient is treated incorrectly, treatment cannot correct the underlying cause, so there is a high risk of further deterioration.

In addition, certain types of breast cancer are associated with increased mortality. These include:\nProstate Cancer\nMultiple myeloma\nLung cancer. Some patients with lung cancer may also be treated incorrectly because of incorrect interpretation of CT scans or other diagnostic tests. Patients with lung cancer who are treated correctly will experience less progression of their disease.\nQuestion: brain tumors\nComplete Answer: A significant number of men with head and neck cancers have been misdiagnosed. Some may develop cancer that is not actually malignant. Other men may believe they have a benign tumor, even though they might never grow large enough to warrant surgery. Even very aggressive forms of brain tumors can progress over time. Men with these tumors should seek professional evaluation to determine what type of care will be best for them.

QUESTION: What is an effective way to prevent the spread of Lyme disease? Complete Answer: There have been several studies showing that antibiotics don't work very well. Some research suggests that the best option is to use a tick repellent to protect yourself from ticks. Other options include applying oil on your skin, using a chemical spray containing DEET (also known as picaridin), or putting a mosquito net over you head. You can also wear insect repellant and use a bug catcher or bug spray to cover up your body when walking outside in areas where mosquitoes are prevalent. If you suspect that you may be bitten by a bitey bug (such as an African clawed beetle or blacklegged tick), contact your doctor or local public health department immediately at once.",58,Risk to develop multiple sclerosis,-1.46671462059021,19,multimedqa,7,0.08225108225108226,184,5

As a child you have been taught that the airways (the passages through which air passes) protect your lungs from foreign substances (such as pollen), so your mother/teacher tells you, ""If you breathe in more than the amount necessary, it will cause an allergic reaction."" Your doctor may also tell you that if you don't take enough of certain medications, you'll get asthma. It's important for you to know how asthma works before you can avoid causing it or getting treated for it.\nQuestion: What does ""healthy diet"" mean? Complete Answer: Healthy diet means eating whole foods that meet all of the following criteria: Have a high nutrient density;

Have a low glycemic index; and

Be rich in fiber. You should be able to eat a variety of fresh fruits, vegetables, lean protein, grains, legumes, nuts, seeds and oil. Avoid trans fats. A healthy diet includes about 1 to 2 servings a day of fruit juice, cooked vegetable and lean meats (e.g., hamburger, turkey, fish), eggs, dairy products, beans, nuts, olive oil, and seafood. This list provides only general guidelines and should not be taken to indicate what you must consume on a daily basis. The American Heart Association has published a number of dietary guidelines based on evidence. These recommendations include limiting saturated fat and cholesterol, reducing intake of sugars, and increasing consumption of unsaturated fats, but there are many other factors that contribute to heart disease. The most important thing to remember is that the best advice we can give to people who want to prevent heart attack or stroke is to reduce their total calories.

gpt2-large_130,"\nThe muscles of the neck (vascularity) support the shoulders, so the best exercise is to do them while sitting down. You can use one hand or both hands for this kind of stretching. One thing to watch out for though is that you may have a tight neck, which will make it harder for you to stretch. Also, there is no harm in doing any sort of stretch if your neck muscles are strong enough.


Sitting on a chair with legs spread apart is also an excellent way to stretch your neck muscles, especially as they increase during pregnancy.


How to Stretch Your Neck and Shoulders


Step 1: Sit in a comfortable position.


If you need to take your arms off the desk when you're working from home, stand with your back against something solid like a wall or a table, such as a chair or a couch. If you need to get up from a seated position, place some of your weight back on the chair or couch and sit up straight until your body feels relaxed again. When you first sit in your office chair, keep it elevated.


This stretches your upper arm bones, which tend to be shorter than those of other people's arms, and makes it easier to push through tension in your lower spine.


Step 2: Place the tip of your index finger lightly touching the inside of your wrist. The palm side of your hand should not touch the outside of your forearm bone. Hold this position for 30 seconds or longer without moving your fingers.


To lengthen or shorten your neck muscles, try placing the tips of your thumb and pinky together at the top of your neck, just below your earlobe. Try not to move the fingers. This moves the muscle of your cervical vertebrae away from each other and helps prevent neck problems later in life.


Step 3: Slowly stretch forward.


When you've reached the point where your head isn't completely turned toward the ceiling, slowly raise your left elbow slightly until it touches the floor or the bottom edge of the bed. Slowly bring your right knee forward a few inches, then let go. Do it three times. For full range of motion, try raising your right leg up by bending forward instead of using the thigh muscles to push yourself forward.


Be sure to rest the right foot on the floor before starting a downward movement.


Keep your elbows closed all the way along. Don't pull on the sides of your torso as much as possible, but don",130,neck and shoulder stretches,-0.0303786676377058,0,multimedqa,7,0.0,429,12
gpt2-large_117,"You should consult your surgeon on the best course of treatment for Stage 4. It is recommended that you discuss this with him or her before going forward with any treatment options. You can use the following steps as an outline in your conversation with your doctor(s). Do not hesitate to ask questions about these topics. You may be asked to review your results or explain what happened to you while being treated. The goal of every patient consultation with your physician is to establish communication between patients and their physicians so that they have access to information about how to better manage their health needs.\n\nQuestion: How long does it take after surgery to get back home?\nAnswer: This question relates directly to whether chemotherapy is effective and appropriate for your situation. However, it also has important implications about your risk of complications during chemotherapy. For most people who undergo chemotherapy, their outlook for the rest of their lives remains very positive. Many have a much longer time ahead of them than expected for completing chemotherapy; however, there are some individuals whose outcomes are unpredictable due to factors such as genetic predisposition, prior treatment experiences, and ongoing illnesses. If you know someone who has undergone chemotherapy, talk to them about their experience with chemo. Some people may need more monitoring from chemo therapy because of possible side effects of other treatments at earlier stages of the disease. Also, remember that many doctors will refer you to other specialists when you become sicker and receive additional chemotherapy. Even if you do not experience adverse events, it's still advisable to monitor your progress and adjust your dose or schedule of medication to keep your condition under control. Anecdotal reports suggest that a number of individuals who had received additional or delayed chemotherapy were able to overcome adverse reactions without becoming ill during this time. As you age, the rate of cancer recurrence increases and the likelihood of developing additional cancers increases. In addition, some medications used to treat advanced breast cancer (pemetrexed) or pancreatic cancer may interact with certain other drugs used to treat cancer. There are also many types of chemotherapy drugs available today which contain different chemicals. The only thing that always stays constant with any new drug is its ability to produce significant harm. In addition, there is no guarantee that all therapies will work for everyone, even those who are receiving the right kind of therapy. Therefore, many patients choose to stay on the current treatment regimen until they have been through all the testing and follow up necessary to determine whether the drugs are actually working. Sometimes, though, the individual must change his or her",117,stage 4 metastatic lung cancer outcome,-9.327007293701172,70,multimedqa,7,0.28225806451612906,447,4

gpt2-large_96,"A high protein diet of > 25% fat is more energy dense than a low protein diet that is less energy dense. There is no evidence that the human body can tolerate this type of diet because it leads to increased blood pressure in addition to weight loss.

In fact, one recent study found that eating just 2% of your total calories as protein leads to greater weight loss than eating only 20% of your caloric intake. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18240582) And, a 2010 study at the University of Maryland School of Medicine found that increasing dietary protein intake resulted in larger reductions in body mass index than did decreasing carbohydrates. Another 2008 study by the UMass Amherst Department of Nutrition showed that the amount of dietary protein is not enough for optimal nutrition, but that you do need sufficient amounts of carbohydrate to help the body maintain its homeostasis. It does this through ""the insulin secretory response."" The reason for this is simple – when you eat carbs, you release glucose into the bloodstream, which increases appetite; however, if you don't have an adequate amount of carbohydrates circulating, the body will try to use some of them to produce energy.\nQuestion: what is the optimum macronutrient ratio? Complete Answer: This depends on several factors including muscle mass, age, gender, sex hormones and overall diet quality. Many people consider 3 to 5 grams of protein per pound of lean body mass to be ideal. You should aim for between 1.5 and 2 grams per pound of bodyweight, although those with a lower baseline may find it easier to get there. If you are overweight or obese, you may want to limit your protein to 0.7 to 0.9 grams per pound of body weight, and you should avoid any foods that cause insulin resistance, such as fast food, processed meats, fried foods, white bread, sugar-sweetened beverages and chocolate. Some people find that higher levels of protein lead to better insulin sensitivity, while others report decreased insulin sensitivity after consuming protein.\nQuestion: how much protein should I take everyday? Complete Answer: Always check the label on your supplement before taking. Too little protein will probably make you feel bloated and sluggish, so it's best to aim for at least 2 g of protein daily. Also keep in mind that many supplements contain ingredients which contain both essential amino acids and small amounts of casein proteins.

Complete Answer: Read everything that has an organic (or ""natural"") component. If your doctor tells you ""nothing works"", then don't believe him or her, go ahead and try something new. And if you're not sure what's in your body, call your physician and ask him/her!\nQuestion: why am I getting acne? Complete Answer: Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The skin needs sunlight to reproduce. For this reason, most women will have their period during the summer months. In addition, some women have trouble keeping their periods because they may be taking oral contraceptives. What can happen? Well, there's nothing wrong with the hormones but hormonal birth control pills can interfere with ovulation. If you take these as well, you may have vaginal dryness for several weeks after menstruation starts. This could cause inflammation in your vagina, which would also affect the skin and make your skin more sensitive and prone to infections. Therefore, many women avoid using oral contraceptives, which results in acne and other issues.\nQuestion: why does my hair look different than normal?\nComplete Answer: Hair follicles contain small glands called follicle-stimulating hormone receptors. These stimulate the growth of healthy hairs by releasing certain chemicals into the environment. Because women are born with naturally occurring hair follicles, our faces grow hair before we start puberty, so that we might eventually wear a wig and have a natural hairstyle when we leave home. When we stop growing our hair, however, there is no longer any way to produce additional hair. So what happens in women who stop growing hair? They experience thinning hair lines. Some women also lose their ability to use their hands, teeth, eyes, ears, nose, tongue, lips, throat, stomach, and bladder and develop gagging symptoms including difficulty swallowing and constipation.\nQuestion: Why do girls have such fine hair?\nAnswer: Your brain makes the hair follicles and produces the hormones that stimulate them. When your brain is not active and your pituitary gland doesn't release enough of the hormone prolactin, the hair becomes coarse and coarse.\nQuestion: How can I improve my health?

However, you may be able to tolerate diarrhea for some time if it contains only one type of bacterium, since the bacterial content in your feces has been shown to vary from person to person.\nQuestion: should I change my diaper? A: The first thing you need to do when changing your diapers is to wash the baby's bottom (which means using a wet/dry method). Once your baby is dry, put him into his carrier and sit down on the floor in an upright position with both legs together so he cannot turn around while you are changing his diaper. You will probably get more upset than usual at this point, but don't worry – you won't hurt yourself! It really isn't very hard to do and it's much less messy than putting the baby on the back with his feet up and away from you. Put the cover back over the baby and repeat until your baby becomes accustomed to sitting still and avoiding turning. If you're not comfortable changing your baby by himself, try placing him in another room with a parent (or a friend) to help him settle. In the meantime, use the cover on the carrier instead of wiping yourself with cold water. If you want your baby to sleep through the night and enjoy the rest of the day, then you must also give him the opportunity to nurse. The reason why you see mothers taking their babies out for a walk when they start breastfeeding is because they think it helps them sleep better. To keep a bottle warm, hold the breast under your arm rather than using your fingers. This allows you to stay warm without having to run your hands all over the bottle. For more information on nursing at home, visit our Parenting page. In general, you should NEVER feed your infant by hand, even if you know how to properly wash your hands. That said, there is nothing wrong with doing something like rubbing a breast pad or dabbing some petroleum jelly on your nipple during feeding if you feel it works better than pumping. Your baby's natural milk producing ability also plays an important role in helping him absorb nutrition throughout the day, especially if he's hungry. Many moms report that they can easily recover from a bad diaper change by just changing their clothing and putting their new clothes on before going shopping or being with someone else.

gpt2-large_112,"\N\Hepatitis A is a common but treatable condition that affects 1 in 5 Americans. It's caused by a virus called Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). You may also have it if you've been exposed to the tuberculosis bacteria in your lungs or with an infected person. Symptoms vary from person to person and can be mild, moderate, severe, or even life threatening. However, treatment for TB usually involves treating the infection with antibiotics. Your doctor will determine whether your current medications are working to prevent future complications.\nWhen should I see my doctor? Answer: Any time during the first year of being ill, or any time after you stop taking medicines because they no longer work. This includes if you develop signs and symptoms such as fever, chills, coughs, sore throat, chest pain or shortness of breath. If you have a fever, don't drive until you're well rested.

\rQuestion: what happens when I take an oral medication that causes liver damage? \nAnswer: When an oral medicine that contains L-dopa (L-DOPA) destroys the liver cells, it is known as hepatic failure. The liver has a special cell called a livers lining called the stellate gums. Under normal circumstances this lining helps filter toxins from food and other materials into the bloodstream. When you take an orally administered drug that contains L-DOPA, the lining becomes damaged, and the toxin builds up inside the body. In addition, excessive levels of acidity cause excess sodium loss through the kidneys which damages them. Eventually, your liver and kidneys become so weak that you'll die. Liver death occurs more often than most people realize and many times it is not recognized until years later.\nWhat are the options for someone who needs help detoxifying their system?\nAnswer: To remove toxic substances from your blood stream, you must drink lots of water and eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans, along with good quality protein foods such as fish, chicken, turkey, eggs, and soy milk. Eating certain types of fat also helps keep the toxins out of your blood stream. Unfortunately, some drugs that contain L-DOPA may be addictive and cause side effects. These include prescription antihistamines like Benadryl (Benadryl XR), which can make you feel sleepy and increase your risk of developing sleep apnea; antidepressants like Prozac (Zoloft), which can slow down the heart rate;",112,symptoms of asthma,-11.495620727539062,153,multimedqa,8,0.7285714285714285,386,10

He started it in October of 2014 at age 4. It's hard for me to give him any advice because his symptoms have only gotten worse over time, which leads to more questions than answers. What should we do?\nAnswer: The best thing you can do when your child starts having stomach problems is not take him for tests that may show signs of IBS. Also avoid taking your child on medications for acid reflux, such as Coumadin, Prevacid, or Armodafinil. Take him to the doctor whenever they suggest it if he doesn't get better with these medications. Your child probably won't need surgery, so don't worry too much. Most kids will be okay after about 3 months and some may even be cured within 6 weeks. If they don't improve, discuss with your pediatrician what other options might work. \nQuestion: Hi!

gpt2-large_83,"The diagnosis is based on all the information available regarding your symptoms, medical history, physical exam, MRI scan results, and other tests and evidence. For example, you should be aware that most people with MS have problems with their eyes (such as glaucoma), but no one knows for sure why some people develop a progressive loss of vision or blindness in certain areas of the body, while others don't. This could mean that MS has something to do with eye tissue being damaged. People often describe these types of changes as ``blind spots,'' and it's possible that some of them may actually be signs of MS itself. In addition, there are a number of different diseases that can cause significant visual problems including cancer, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, and even Alzheimer's Disease. Although everyone gets MS at some point, people who live more than 10 years often experience much worse vision than those who remain healthy. While MS is not life threatening, many people do feel better with time, and this can lead to improvements in daily living. If a patient has MS for a long time, he or she might become confused or lose touch with reality. Many people think they will have an opportunity to find out what causes MS if they go to a doctor or see a specialist. Unfortunately, some doctors only recognize MS when someone presents with symptoms such as fatigue, chronic pain, or trouble concentrating. Even then, no one really knows how to diagnose MS and how to treat it. It also doesn't help that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders doesn't list any specific criteria to determine whether someone has MS. The American Medical Association recommends getting an actual MRIs before starting treatment and reviewing your condition regularly after treatment.\nQuestion: What can I expect from my primary care physician and the mental health team?\nAnswer: Ask questions like: How would you handle this situation if someone had a stroke or was diagnosed with ALS? Can you explain how to read a chart correctly? Can you tell me what kind of medications are best for you? Can I ask about your family history of depression, anxiety, substance abuse, or bipolar disorder? Where did you grow up? Do you ever worry about whether you'll make it through school? Is there anything that you'd consider doing differently if you were younger? When will you graduate high school or college? Does anyone in your family have been diagnosed with MS?

You can find more information on the treatment options at www.breastcancertreatments.org/treatment.html. Question: Should I get a mammogram before getting pregnant? Complete Answer: You should be tested prior to being pregnant because there is no evidence that regular screening improves pregnancy outcomes; if you do decide to have your baby screened, follow your doctor's advice regarding the best way to receive the test. There are no studies indicating that routine mammograms improve your chances of having healthy children or grandchildren. However, some women who want to avoid testing may consider postponing their childbearing until after they reach menopause because testing is less likely to detect early signs of breast cancer, such as high-grade lesions. In general, you will be better off not having any risk factors for breast cancer before age 50 (except in women under age 40 with a family history). If you must get a mammogram after age 50, take it after a year has passed since you stopped smoking or quit drinking alcohol. See the Breast Cancer Screening page for further information. Question: What is the difference between estrogen and progestin in my pill form? Complete Answer: Both estrogen and progestin are hormones used by women to control the menstrual cycle and induce ovulation. For example, an oral contraceptive containing estrogen causes ovulation and the release of estrogen into the bloodstream. Progestin also induces ovulation and leads to the release of progesterone. The two hormones act on different receptors in cells throughout your body. Estrogen is found primarily in the ovaries, while progestin predominates in the adrenal glands. It takes effect right away when taken along with other hormone replacement therapies. Women taking estrogen only during their periods may experience side effects such as hot flashes, mood swings, headaches, muscle aches, stomach problems, nausea, bloating, headache, weight gain, vaginal dryness, breast tenderness, breast discharge, fatigue, insomnia, and dizziness. Because progestin is involved in several types of ovarian and uterine cancers, doctors often use both estrogen and progestin together. Most of these effects are reversible once you stop taking the drugs, however, there are no approved treatments that prevent these side effects. Ask your doctor how much progestin to take every day and how long to continue to take each dose",118,stage 4 triple negative breast cancer treatment,-10.908188819885254,117,multimedqa,8,0.5246636771300448,405,8

gpt2-large_77,"Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory disease that affects many different body systems. It causes widespread nerve damage in the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include fatigue, cognitive impairment, visual loss, paralysis of one or both legs, and pain in your lower abdomen and back (called sciatica). The cause is unknown but it can occur as a result of several factors including the immune system attacking healthy cells lining your digestive tract; the destruction of lymph nodes on your lungs that help control infection, and an increase in estrogen in your blood. Because you may have MS for years before even being diagnosed with MS, it's critical that you take the time to learn more about MS and what symptoms you might be experiencing. You should also get accurate information from other sources about MS. For example, if you're a woman who has had multiple sclerosis, you should learn whether you have fibromyalgia or depression. The two disorders often coexist in people who have MS. You'll find that it is important to talk to others who have been diagnosed with MS because they will probably have very similar experiences and will likely offer valuable advice.\n\n Question: What's the difference between my MS flare and flare up? Complete Answer: When you first notice any problems with your MS symptoms, these tend to go away gradually. If you start having new symptoms after four weeks of treatment, or after two months of treatment, your doctor usually recommends that you stop treatment immediately until things return to normal. But sometimes a flareup could indicate that there's something else wrong. These flare ups could be related to the disease itself, another type of illness, medication side effects, or a combination of the two. For some people, their flareups don't seem all that different than when they started out with MS symptoms. But, in many cases, the differences between a person with a typical MS flare and a person with a flare up could mean that their chances of getting better are dramatically increased. In fact, people with a typical flare may benefit from continuing their treatment regardless of their flare ups. This is especially true if you have symptoms during a flare that don't change much over time. Some people just need to stay symptom free for a while longer. \n

The typical symptoms associated with these diseases include pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, skin changes, joint and muscle pains, weight gain/loss, difficulty sleeping, blurred vision, loss of hearing, and sometimes even death.\nTo help you better understand what each of these conditions mean, this article provides some basic information on each of them. \r

As mentioned above, cancer can lead to more serious problems such as breast, colon, prostate, lung, kidney, and bone marrow cancers. If not treated properly, cancer will eventually kill you. You should consult your doctor if you experience any of these kinds of symptoms. Other diseases that may be caused by certain chronic illnesses include diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, high cholesterol, low blood pressure, obesity, asthma, allergies, depression, migraine headaches, rheumatoid arthritis, and many others. \nQuestion: Which diseases are connected to other diseases such as diabetes and heart disease? Complete Answer: Many different types of chronic diseases are related to one another. Some of the following conditions often cause both a cancer and a heart attack: \nRheumatic heart disease (rhinitis), which is inflammation in the lining of the lungs; \nPulmonary embolism, which occurs when air rushes into the lungs due to an injury; \nCancer that spreads to other parts of the body (such as lung cancer); \nEpilepsy (convulsions), especially during pregnancy; \nDiabetes, which has various causes but typically results from overfeeding or lack of exercise; \nHeart attacks, especially at the start of life and again after age 65; \nDementia, usually of the elderly, which includes memory loss and mental deterioration; \nAcute myocardial infarction (heart attack), also called myocardial infarction, sudden death after a heart attack, or a heart attack, which does not involve a blockage of coronary arteries; \nLiver cirrhosis, which means liver damage and can occur through several reasons, including alcohol abuse or hepatitis C infection. Liver disease is a leading cause of mortality among people aged 65 and older. It can progress rapidly if untreated.

gpt2-large_105,"The tooth is located in the root of your upper jawbone and can be seen with an x-ray or dentist's mirror. It is made up of a layer of enamel between two layers of calcium phosphate. Gum disease usually results from eating too much sugar or refined carbohydrate products such as white flour or potato chips that contain glucose. Tooth decay occurs when bacteria within the mouth, especially plaque, cause the teeth to become discolored. A tooth cannot heal itself by becoming soft. If you have cavities, you may want to ask your dental hygienist for help. Your dentist will explain what can go wrong with your smile (lack of breathability) or lack of bite. You might also consider having your teeth examined at a private dental office if there is not someone near you who has experience using a dental tool.

If you already know how to correct problem conditions, you'll likely find this resource more beneficial than information on natural remedies. But many people have a hard time understanding what causes bad breath and if it is worth treating. Some suggest simply brushing one's teeth every day. Others believe that the only thing needed to make their breath smell better is removing the carbon dioxide produced by smoking cigarettes. In any case, most dentists recommend brushing once or twice daily. When we talk about preventing tooth decay, we're talking about maintaining good oral hygiene. For example, use fluoride mouthwashes and rinse your hands thoroughly after bathing. If you brush your teeth regularly, they should stay cleaner longer.

What Can I Do?

The best prevention method is brushing well. Regularly brushing your teeth helps prevent plaque buildup, which makes your breath odorous and difficult to breathe through.

Some types of caries (dentures) can get worse without treatment. If you notice that you need additional care to keep your teeth healthy, see your dentist to discuss options. Remember that dentists offer many treatments that can improve your overall health. Consult your doctor before starting any new medication regimen or making changes to anything you've been taking for the past several months.

gpt2-large_62,"They may not be aware of my disability, but they can easily infer that I have MS when I'm in the office or on the phone. In addition, I am often asked by clients if it's possible for me to attend an appointment with their physician without feeling sick (even though I'm covered under the ADA). This is because some physicians believe that MS might require medications or other treatments. As long as no one has any reason to suspect that I'm going to take any medication, I cannot complain. When I'm out of the office, doctors sometimes ask ""Do you feel ill?"" But I just tell them that I don't know and move on to another topic.\nQuestion: should I disclose that I have chronic pain while visiting patients?\nAnswer: If I see patients who are experiencing pain, I am able to give information about what is causing it; however, because most people think of MS as a physical condition, they would assume that I must use all of my senses to assess the severity of pain. To avoid such confusion, I usually don't report that I suffer from MS. However, if I do visit someone who suffers from MS, I can provide information about pain. For example, I could write down the specific symptoms of the person's pain, and then explain why this pain level is so difficult to manage. The only exception to this rule is when I receive a diagnosis of depression. In this case, I would report the details of how much time I spend with the patient during each visit, along with any problems I encounter. If a doctor thinks I've made too many visits to that individual to count, he/she is more likely to order additional tests that may reveal that I'm suffering from MS. I also recommend that when working at home, when I arrive at my desk, I immediately walk through the door. This helps keep the conversation away from my computer screen, and allows me to maintain eye contact. At the same time, it prevents anyone from thinking that I have been sitting there for hours. \nQuestion: where is my MS label printed?\nAnswer: It is usually on the back of your prescription bottle, so I won't need to print it in the bathroom. However, if I go to the pharmacy to purchase pills, it is important that I return the pill container to the pharmacist before leaving. This way, if I ever get lost, I'll know exactly where my medicine is.

gpt2-large_35,"A person who is taking insulin has not been shown to have an adverse effect on their glucose control when they follow a ketogenic or keto diet. In addition, there is little evidence that the type of food consumed affects blood sugar levels in patients taking insulin (i.e., individuals who do not eat carbohydrates). When you take insulin, your body produces the hormone insulin. Insulin increases glucose uptake by cells through several pathways. The increase in glucose uptake can reduce blood glucose levels because it lowers blood sugar levels and leads to increased use of insulin (which can decrease the amount of insulin available to the cell) and more efficient utilization of glucose. Because your body does not produce insulin to make glucose, you will need to consume less carbohydrate than would normally be required to maintain normal blood sugars. Your pancreas may release insulin if necessary, but it is unlikely that this will cause you to experience any side effects. If you find yourself having trouble keeping a regular meal schedule, try avoiding carbs entirely during these times. For example, if you feel like eating breakfast every day at 8am, avoid carbohydrates. You should also ensure that you don't lose too much weight while following a ketogenic diet because losing fat can result in weight gain. For information on how to create a personalized nutrition plan, please see our Nutritional Consultation section.

The Bottom Line This section provides a brief overview of research findings related to diabetes and ketosis. It highlights some of the most frequently asked questions about using a ketogenic diet and how many calories you should be consuming per day as well as your daily carb intake.

Is a Ketogenic Diet Helpful for People With Diabetes?

A number of studies indicate that people with type 1 diabetes and/or type 2 diabetes may benefit from adopting a low carbohydrate lifestyle such as a very low carbohydrate diet or a ketogenic diet (see Table 1 below). However, some patients may find the benefits of using such diets difficult or impossible to sustain over time (for more information, please see: ""Ketogenic Diets - What's the Difference Between a Low Carbohydrate & Ketogenic Diet?""). Many of the clinical trials that evaluated the efficacy of a low carbohydrate diet for managing type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes have involved patients with mild to moderate complications. Because people with chronic illnesses often seek alternative treatment options, careful consideration must always be given before making dietary recommendations. While the best way to ensure adequate blood sugar control and prevent complications associated with diabetes is to manage blood glucose levels with medication and monitor them closely,",35,Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?,-0.0291001182049512,2,multimedqa,8,0.012903225806451613,443,46

gpt2-large_131,"\qquad[What is the name of a well known exercise that works so well for people with neck pain?]\n\n1) The ""Wall"" Lie (Lie on your back with one knee bent at 90 degrees). It's best if you hold it in place while lying flat or on a pillow. This will help prevent the muscles from being strained by the stress of sitting down. You can bend your knees higher than they should be but this doesn't work as well because the extra pressure on the lower spine causes strain in your cervical vertebrae.

2) The Wall Rope Lie is an advanced variation on the Wall Lie. If you have trouble keeping your legs straight during the Wall Lie, try using a rope instead. Hold onto the end of the rope and lean forward. Keep a neutral spine position throughout while holding the weight of your body against the ceiling above your head. To increase flexibility, use a barbell or dumbbell between your thighs and push against the wall with both arms to activate your core. To keep things light, avoid using any heavy weights. A couple of additional benefits of the Wall Lie include: Increased mobility due to the vertical nature of the lie; Decreased risk of overuse injuries as you become more proficient in the Wall Lie.


3) Wall Sits, also called Wall Hugs, is an alternative movement to Wall Lying that can improve your range of motion and decrease muscle tension. Use one leg to sit up and bring the other into a squatting position. Your bodyweight can be supported by supporting yourself with a support hand or a sturdy object such as a chair or stool. Once seated, slowly raise and lower your torso until your butt touches the floor. Slowly return to standing position and repeat for the recommended number of repetitions.

4) Wall Spinning is similar to Wall Sitting, but instead of resting your head off the floor, spin around, rotating your entire body around the ground. When performing Wall Spinning, focus on keeping your head above the surface of the earth rather than using gravity to keep you upright. Continue spinning for 20 seconds before stopping. Repeat again for desired amount of time.

5) One-Arm Dumbbell Curls works very similarly to Wall Curling, except that instead of supporting your whole body with a pair of hands, you use just one arm to support your weight. Perform 30 repetitions for each arm and then switch arms for the next set. Try this move for 4 sets of 6 reps.",131,exercises for better posture,-6.491872310638428,24,multimedqa,8,0.2823529411764706,423,7

In fact, patients who received pain relievers without a prescription often found them more effective than the painkillers they were taking.\nQuestion: Does a pill that takes less than an hour to swallow have any effect on my weight, body fat percentage, or muscle mass? Is there any difference in the results of different foods eaten throughout the day?\nAnswer: The answer depends on your diet, exercise habits, and your health status. For example, if you eat a diet high in carbohydrates, you may lose some muscle mass in the short term but gain it back when you stop eating carbs. Also, while your body burns calories, its metabolism also uses stored body fat as fuel, so there's no direct way to tell which foods might have an impact on your weight, body fat percentage, or overall fitness level. It doesn't matter whether you're overweight, underweight, or normal, because these factors can all affect how much body fat you'll store. On the other hand, it's likely that you won't get any significant improvements in your overall physical performance by simply cutting out carbohydrate intake during this time period. That being said, many people do report feeling a slight benefit from consuming a small amount of starch (such as table sugar) just before a meal.\nIf your doctor has prescribed certain drugs such as blood thinner warfarin, then it's possible that the medications may cause changes in your appetite and/or the ability to control your hunger.

Frequently Asked Questions About Multiple Sclerosis How long does it take to develop multiple sclerosis?\nThe average age at onset of MS is between 15 and 25 years old. At least one person in 100 experiences early onset of the disease; usually a third to half of people experience full disability within 5 to 10 years of diagnosis.

Question: What is the difference between miscarriage and abortion?\nAnswer: This question can be answered using several simple and clear signs. The first sign that you may have experienced an abortion (miscarriage) is if your baby has stopped developing fully or if it does not grow at all. You may also have experienced this type of symptom after a miscarriage. A more severe form of abortion involves removing all or part of the fetus from the uterus through some means other than surgery. Other symptoms include nausea and vomiting; pain during sex or masturbation; loss of body weight; loss of interest in things like eating, sleeping, or sex; irritability or anger; inability to concentrate or to keep up with daily tasks; headaches; difficulty thinking clearly; changes in behavior; problems concentrating or remembering information; and emotional problems. In addition, there could be problems with breastfeeding, or if your baby becomes premature or small for his or her age.

gpt2-large_63,"There is no definitive answer for this question as the causes of MS remain mysterious. The National Institutes of Health estimates that 30% of adults with MS will develop MS within 10 years of the first symptoms and 50% within 20 years. However, the exact cause remains unknown. Many scientists believe MS may be related to a genetic defect or an environmental factor such as pesticides, toxic metals, heavy metal exposure, excessive sugar intake or alcohol abuse, but there is currently no cure or effective treatment for the disease. In addition to MS, MS also affects several other types of diseases and conditions. The most common reason people find their careers affected by MS is stress. Because many people have a history of depression, anxiety, and/or insomnia, they have a higher risk of developing MS than people without these disorders. As a result, those who do experience these symptoms often seek help from physicians. A number of studies found that patients with MS were more likely to obtain professional licenses when their chronic illnesses had been treated successfully before, and more likely to retain their jobs after a positive diagnosis. For example, one study reported that patients with MS were significantly less likely to lose their job if they had a prior diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) (10). Another study examined whether employers would offer a disability benefit for MS and found that employers' willingness increased substantially in response to the presence of MDD and the presence of significant pre-existing illness. According to this study, only 2 percent of companies offered benefits based on MS symptoms; the prevalence was much lower for women with MDD and men with diabetes (11). Other research has shown that MS patients are less motivated to become employees, even after they receive full compensation, because they perceive it as an unnecessary hardship (12). Some experts argue that workers should not expect a high level of motivation just because of a condition like MS. While some researchers have suggested that negative feelings may deter individuals from seeking out information about issues surrounding MS, others have argued that these feelings often serve as barriers to better understanding. For example, some feel that the stigma associated with MS impairs their ability to share their experiences and provides an inadequate basis for evaluating potential candidates. Although there are different opinions regarding what causes MS, one thing is clear: People who have MS face considerable challenges in finding employment despite having excellent educational credentials and extensive work experience. When you consider how difficult it can be for individuals with MS to gain access to information on the topic, you might wonder why there are so few articles on the subject available online.

If you find yourself thinking, ""I am not as smart as my friends,"" then it is likely that you have a psychological disorder.\nQuestion: Should I get an appointment with my doctor if I feel like I may be having an anxiety attack? Complete Answer:\nAnxiety attacks are dangerous because of their unpredictability and rapidity. This includes those who have recently been diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder, or another mental illness. An anxious person may also experience a panic attack (a sudden outburst of intense emotion), which often causes them to lose control of themselves and to have a panic attack in front of others. It has been estimated by experts that between 20% and 40% of people with a diagnosable anxiety disorder will develop an episode of generalized anxiety within five years of diagnosis, while around 25% to 50% may experience symptoms every day. The average time from onset to a first incident of generalized anxiety lasts one month.

When you are able to relax and rest, you become less stressed.

gpt2-large_85,"An MS is an inflammation of the central nervous system. It occurs when one or more immune cells attack and destroy healthy tissue (called ""primary sclerosing cholangitis""). The body then tries to repair itself by repairing damaged tissue with new, healthier blood vessels and nerves that may be called secondary sclerosing cholangitis. In addition, other inflammatory processes occur as well. For example, the body creates antibodies that fight these infections. These antibodies also help the immune system identify and destroy harmful proteins in the bloodstream, such as those associated with cancer or viral infections. As a result, people who have MS experience symptoms often lasting only a few days, but sometimes longer periods can accompany relapses. A person who has MS might not even realize she has it for months or years after the initial onset. Symptoms are similar in some cases to a migraine, and most commonly affect the eye, face, neck, jaw, back, arms, and legs. There are many types of MS, including chronic relapsing MS (CRMS), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and multiple sclerosis. You might be able to diagnose MS using tests of your own blood, urine or saliva, X-rays, MRI scans, biopsies or a CT scan.

In this tutorial we will cover the basic steps of obtaining an accurate reading on your blood pressure. This is so that you can accurately determine if you need any medications to help treat your condition. A medical doctor has determined your blood pressure based on factors such as weight, height, age, sex, race, and body mass index (BMI).\r

When you read your own blood pressure measurement (the Blood Pressure Reading or BP), it should be taken in two parts. One part is your actual reading done by your physician in which he measures the actual drop in your blood pressure. The other part is a special form of testing called an echocardiogram which measures changes in your heart's electrical activity when you have high or low blood pressure. When a patient with high blood pressure takes the test for their first time, they often experience shortness of breath or chest pain as their heart rate increases. After taking the Echocardiograph, the patient may have difficulty breathing but will not show any signs of an abnormal heart rhythm. At home, many people take blood pressure readings from a simple finger stick but this will only give them an inaccurate reading because of small inaccuracies in the needle's tip. The more accurate way of getting a good reading is with an electronic echocardiograph. The Electronic echocardiography is available over the Internet at www.echotronic.org.

An echocardiogram consists of two major components; one is an ultrasound image that shows your heart beating through your skin and another is a pulse oximeter that measures how fast your pulse moves down your arm. It is important to note that both the ultrasound image and pulse oximeter measurements provide a rough estimate of your blood pressure level. There is no way to know exactly what your blood pressure could be if you were taking multiple medications. Therefore, it is very important to obtain multiple readings while taking these different medications. If you wait too long between using the different medications, there is a chance that your readings will be off. You do this by staying awake and paying attention to your heartbeat. If you get a reading higher than normal (over 140) then it would suggest that you may need to lower your dosage of one of the medications. In addition, it is best to keep track of all of your medications since the echocardiogram will allow you to know where your risk for bleeding is.

Answer: MS is an ongoing illness that affects a person's ability to move around, speak, think, hear, see, smell, touch, taste, smell again, see again, feel pain, understand language, make decisions, learn new skills, and perform basic functions. The disease can cause chronic disability, which may last years after diagnosis. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of several types of autoimmune diseases, which affect most people throughout their lives. There are currently more than 50 different kinds of MS, each with its own specific symptoms, causes, and complications.


The exact nature of MS varies greatly from individual to individual. Some forms include relapsing remitting MS, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and focal segmental glaucoma (FSG). These three types of MS share some characteristics: the disease is largely controlled by immune cells called T cells; it progresses over time; the disease results in damage to peripheral nervous systems (eyes, skin, etc.); and there is limited response to standard treatment. But, while all three of these types of MS share a general feature in that they often involve peripheral vision loss, they do not share a specific feature in that the severity of the lesions vary considerably and/or the medications used to treat them differ widely. For example, PML can leave few if any signs or symptoms behind but does have severe nerve damage; FSG leaves no obvious sign of injury but involves extensive damage to nerves and body tissues; and PML may result in a life-long disability even after the disease has been controlled or cured.",55,How to manage multiple sclerosis?,-0.8314191102981567,118,multimedqa,8,0.4796747967479675,303,13

They may be accompanied by feelings of restlessness, irritability, or lethargy. In addition to these symptoms, there are other signs of fatigue such as lightheadedness, light sensitivity, tiredness, poor concentration, memory loss, sleep disturbances, and difficulty concentrating (i.e., impaired thinking). Most of these signs typically subside within two weeks after treatment is completed. However, some symptoms, such as increased daytime drowsiness, increase over time. Some people experience both short term and long term effects from exercise stress on their body and brain. Long term effects can range from mild headaches and stiffness to severe depression that may last for many years (Long term effects of exercise stress are discussed at http://www.msf.gov/msfc/treatment/longtermeffects.htm ).\nQuestion: What should I do when I have an attack of acute fatigue? Complete Answer: Many times, early detection of this type of injury is critical to preventing a relapse. Symptoms usually begin three days to six weeks prior to onset of illness. Patients often report feeling particularly weak, dizzy, and pale shortly before their attacks occur. A patient's general appearance will also change from day to day due to the changes occurring in his or her body temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiration. Patients who develop acute fatiguing illnesses may require multiple courses of medication (i.e., high dose steroids) to counteract the physical damage caused by the infection and inflammation.

What is Multiple Sclerosis?\nAnswer:

MS is a chronic inflammatory neurological disorder that affects 1% to 3% of people. It occurs when the immune system attacks and damages nerve fibers known as axons or dendrites in nerve cells. This damage causes changes in movement that result in paralysis of an affected limb. Symptoms vary widely among individuals and include difficulty walking, difficulty swallowing, trouble speaking, numbness and tingling in certain parts of the body, and problems with memory, language, balance, coordination, sensory perception, and judgment. A new patient may present with severe pain, fever, and a limp; the same patient may present in 2 weeks with no problem but have a swollen leg or a severe headache. Patients often suffer from cognitive impairment which often makes everyday tasks difficult. Many people report their symptoms improve over time. Some recover fully, some do not. In contrast to many other diseases, MS has been successfully treated by conventional treatment methods. MS is generally curable if treatment begins within 2 years after diagnosis. If left untreated, it will continue to progress until death. With appropriate treatment, the vast majority of persons who become ill with MS remain symptom free.\nQuestions: How long does it take to get better?\nAnswer:

There are two ways to respond to this question, and both options require significant effort. First, follow up with a physician experienced in treating MS. He/she might recommend surgery, immunosuppressive drugs such as steroids, and/or radiation therapy to help control the disease's progression. Second, you may consider seeking out treatment through a specialist like a neurologist or neurosurgeon. These professionals typically offer comprehensive care including",68,List of multiple sclerosis symptoms,-0.2012222856283188,3,multimedqa,8,0.013574660633484163,394,12
gpt2-large_57,"Yes, there are three distinct stages of MS.\nAnswer: What is the difference between early (before age 20) and late (age 40+)? Answer: If you have MS then the ""early"" stage (before age 20) is the first time that you had symptoms. The ""late"" stage (ages 20+) is when symptoms last for an extended period of time, but they still may not be completely gone.\nQuestion: MS severity? Complete Answer: No, there does not appear to be any change in your ability or overall condition with each stage. Question: what are some things I should know about fibromyalgia? Complete Answer: There is no specific test for fibromyalgia. You may have some fatigue, pain, headaches, numbness, depression, and other symptoms depending on how much activity you do. However, there are many factors that can cause these symptoms, including certain foods, stress, exercise, medications and infection. As such, it's very hard to predict which patients will show up at the doctor's office due to their fibromyalgia symptoms. This type of diagnosis also makes for more confusing paperwork and more appointments. In addition, it's important to note that there is no cure for fibromyalgia, and this disorder can affect anyone and everyone.

gpt2-large_93,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that affects the body's ability to process information, including memory, speech, movement, sensation, judgment, emotion, perception, and cognition. It can cause the most disabling symptoms of MS, such as fatigue, numbness/tingling fingers and toes, joint pain, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, vision loss, difficulty speaking, facial nerve paralysis, muscle spasms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, blurred or double vision, dizziness, fainting spells, seizures, and coma.\n

The most commonly reported symptoms include the following: fatigue, irritability, headache, neck pain, weakness, confusion, memory loss, and impaired concentration. The majority of patients with MS have no overt symptoms for months at a time; however, symptoms may appear at any time during the course of MS, typically within 1 year of diagnosis. Many individuals with MS also experience cognitive changes, which usually occur after 12–24 weeks of treatment with conventional drugs.

With increasing age, the number of people living with MS increases dramatically. People 65 years and older account for more than half of all new cases of MS each year. People 75 years and older represent about 20 percent of the total population with MS worldwide. A substantial percentage of this younger population has experienced some form of disability before their first diagnosis and many continue to suffer from the effects of illness into later life. For example, approximately 40% of American adults between 35 and 64 years old were diagnosed with MS prior to age 60, and nearly 50% of these individuals suffered from disability before age 70. Approximately 30% of those diagnosed with MS had an ongoing debilitating condition by age 90. Individuals who begin MS between the ages of 25 and 40 have the highest risk of developing complications from the disease and death during their lifetime. In fact, among persons aged 18–64 years, about one third die of other causes within 5 years of having MS. With advancing age, it becomes increasingly likely that people will eventually develop functional limitations because of the deterioration of their own immune systems. As they do so, they are progressively less able to recognize their own illnesses. However, there remain significant barriers in access to care that lead to continued disability. The median duration of untreated MS symptomatology is currently 28 years, but people are often unaware of what is causing them to experience debilitating symptoms and thus never receive appropriate treatment. According to a study conducted by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, nearly one in five Americans",93,Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?,-0.0620862655341625,2,multimedqa,8,0.010101010101010102,418,28

There are no known long-term adverse events associated with the use of Covid-19. There are also no known risks associated with using a different drug for treating MS. It should be noted that although there have been few reports of illness from people who took multiple sclerosis medications during the last 3 years of clinical trials, a substantial number of persons who received these medications were considered to be at high risk for developing MS because they had taken other medications within 2 weeks before or after their infection.

gpt2-large_79,"Yes you can. In fact, it is possible for your wife or husband (or brother) to have MS if they are exposed to the disease in utero, since multiple sclerosis has been linked to the transmission of this debilitating condition from mother to child. However, no one knows how many children who have inherited this disorder will inherit the disorder themselves, or whether their own children will also develop the disease. A number of studies have shown that it's not at all uncommon for siblings to have an identical disease history that leads to similar symptoms, but that no two siblings with the same diagnosis share any particular genetic mutations. As such, if you want your sister or brother with MS to have the disease, you'd better hope he/she hasn't already had it! The best way to prevent a sibling from having MS is to get them tested before pregnancy. If your sister or brother is going to be pregnant, it's a good idea to get her screened as well so that she doesn't carry MS into birth, or else it might still end up being passed on to her baby. If your sister or brother has MS, don't try to make her feel guilty about taking care of him/herself. It's very difficult to treat MS once it starts. If anyone tries to convince you otherwise, remind yourself that these people were never diagnosed and didn't even know they had the disease. They just thought they were sick. When they got better, they went back home and began treating themselves again.

SUMMARY: Cancer is the number one cause of death in men and women ages 50 years or older, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). It causes over 60% of all cancers in men and 80% of the deaths from them in men. One-third of breast cancers occur at sites other than the nipple (the breasts), which are most likely to be diagnosed early. The breast has been found to have many different types of tumor cells that can spread into surrounding tissues and may pose an increased risk for infection, especially among persons who do not have a normal immune system (such as those with AIDS) or who have immunosuppression, such as HIV/AIDS patients.

Prostate cancer often occurs in people without symptoms or with no history of cancer. In fact, between 60% and 85% of men will develop prostate cancer. These numbers reflect the population distribution of this disease in the U.S., where it's estimated that approximately 4 million new cases each year. The disease is also much more common in African Americans and Latinos, and younger age groups. Men younger than 65 have roughly 20 times greater odds of developing prostate cancer.

Complete Answer: There have been no reports of serious injury due to my work. However, because I am so involved in this field, I am constantly exposed to different types of danger, both personal and workplace. There is always risk, however, because people who work in this profession suffer from a variety of mental illnesses, which often include mood disorder, anxiety, depression, self-destructiveness, alcoholism, drug addiction, and other factors. In addition, many people work under unhealthy conditions, including sleeping conditions, temperatures that cause dehydration, food preparation procedures that contribute to weight gain, physical inactivity, and the environment in which they live. Finally, as a result of these dangers, many people die each year from their injuries, even though they work safely and effectively. Unfortunately, it is impossible to eliminate all of the risk, but the best way to reduce your chances of developing a serious condition such as MS is to remain healthy. Please check out the information below for more information about specific ways to help reduce your risk.\n

About Me

I'm Peter F. Lachance. Since 1997 I've been writing medical articles, reviews, and education material regarding science, medicine, and medical care. For 15 years, I was Director of Research and Evaluation at the National Institutes of Health's Center for Biomedical Research Ethics. During those 16 years I assisted numerous scientists, clinicians, and government officials as they created programs and policies that led to improved patient outcomes and better quality of life in research studies. Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to travel to over 50 countries around the world to consult with scientists, physicians, and researchers from diverse backgrounds.

gpt2-large_113,"The answer is that the lungs have a respiratory system of two chambers, or alveoli, each with its own ""bag"" (or ducts) for air movement throughout the body. The upper airway (the nose), or pharynx, has little lung tissue. A layer of air over this ""mushroom"" consists of small blood vessels which move the oxygenated air through these small tubes.

In an emergency, you may need oxygen as well as oxygen in your bloodstream. At that time you would use a mask that helps keep your face dry and fresh. Then, before going into surgery, you should wear a surgical gown, gloves, and other protective equipment like goggles and boots. This will help protect against infection as well as reduce discomfort during surgery.

If you are going into surgery, your first stop should be a hospital emergency room. You can learn more about what to do while being treated there at our Emergency Room pages. In addition, we recommend that you get all necessary information on the internet, such as the websites of the American Heart Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, the Canadian Paediatric Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. If the person who is operating on you is unfamiliar with the sites, ask them. They might not know that they exist.

Your doctor may also perform a physical exam on you to check for any underlying conditions that could affect your ability to breathe and function safely in the future. For example, some people have heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or certain types of cancer that make breathing difficult. Other doctors may examine your eyes and ears and conduct tests to determine whether your hearing is normal or if it is impaired. After performing these checks, your doctor may offer you prescription medications that he thinks might improve your breathing.

Other forms of therapy may not be effective for all persons, but it will generally be more successful for those who are already feeling good and happy.

\nQuestion: what is cognitive behavioral therapy?\nAnswer: CBT is an intervention based on the scientific fact that we all make mistakes, so it helps us learn from our experiences and correct them when they occur. People use CBT to overcome their own irrational beliefs and behavior patterns, and ultimately make meaningful changes within themselves and in their lives. In some cases, people need to work with a therapist to develop new goals in order to meet the needs of their individual situation.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that adults ages 18 years and older should receive at least 75 percent of their calories from carbohydrates, 30 percent from fat, 20 percent from protein, and 15 percent from complex carbohydrates such as simple sugars, starches, and starchy carbs like white rice, breads, pastas, potatoes, and cornbread. That means they should consume 2,000 calories daily, excluding beverages. Adults with type 1 diabetes who have not achieved glycemic control (normal blood sugar levels) are at greater risk of developing high blood pressure because their bodies cannot effectively use sugar for energy. Type 1 diabetics are more likely than normal-weight people to develop obesity, so it can be very challenging to lose weight when one has diabetes. It may also mean that individuals with diabetes may be overweight even if they do not have metabolic syndrome or other signs and symptoms associated with being obese. In addition, individuals with diabetes need to monitor their diet closely due to the increased risks associated with overeating.

When we first learned of the existence of Type 1 Diabetes in 1987, it was thought that its cure could only come from transplantation or by using drugs which were already on the market (such as insulin). In recent years however this has changed with new medicines being developed which have all the qualities of an effective drug. The hope is that once these will become available, people with type 1 Diabetes who want to lose weight without losing blood sugar levels will find these medicines very suitable.\nQuestion: What is the difference between an artificial pancreas and a natural one? Complete Answer: \/P2\nIn order for a person to receive treatment with an artifical pancreas they must be able to produce insulin, which can take up to 6 months to manufacture and is then tested for purity before the recipient receives their medicine. This process takes approximately 10 weeks for the production of insulin. For people with type 2 Diabetes, where there is no such requirement, the treatment involves receiving insulin through a small device called a transducer which measures the amount of insulin produced by the person's own body. As soon as the medication reaches the sensor, the insulin release stops immediately and the patient starts receiving the appropriate dose each day. In general it is safe to use any type of insulin for any type of illness except diabetics (a disease in which insulin doesn't work) but some individuals with diabetes may need extra care or monitoring while taking medications. If you are thinking of getting an artifical pancreas, please consult your doctor about the safety and effectiveness of the device in treating your condition. Once the procedure is approved, it will cost around $3500 and it should take less than one year to be fully functional and usable. However, if it becomes necessary later, there are several options for aftercare, including home insulin pumps which operate automatically when needed and insulin tablets which last for anywhere between 3 days and 9 months.

Answers provided by Dr. Krizman: 1) When you ask if it hurts when you stand up, this refers to the area of your lower back (back) where there is a nerve called the Valsalva maneuver (VAM), which moves through your spine and connects with the diaphragm. If someone has difficulty standing or walking for any reason, they should see a doctor immediately. 2) When you ask what the pain feels like, this means feeling a sharp throbbing sensation along with muscle tension and mild numbness or pain at times. 3) When you ask how bad it is, this refers to having soreness, numbness, tightness or tenderness at times. 4) Sometimes people think they have a muscle ache or a headache when they just lie down. This is because the brain interprets these as ""muscle pains"". You cannot tell whether this is caused by a muscle ache or a headache until you try to stand or walk. 5) Some people say that they are having back spasms or stiffness if they sit down for any length of time. There is no science behind this. 6) A lot of people believe that they can't sleep without their pillows because their heads hurt. Unfortunately, most people who suffer from insomnia do not realize that they are suffering from low back pain, and therefore don't know how to seek help. 7) Many people believe that if they sleep well, their backs will naturally relax after taking a sleeping pill. This is not true. Your body's natural tendency is to make you tense during sleep. So it makes sense that you would become tired while asleep. 8) Most women report that their breasts get very hot when they wear sleeveless shirts.

In this case, there may be a slight chance that an implantation will occur before or after intercourse. If so, it is likely that the fertilized egg would not be implanted in the uterus. A study published in 1988 examined 28 postmenopausal women who had recently given birth and found that one woman's implantation occurred after intercourse. Another woman's implantation was delayed by more than three days.2) The best contraceptive method for preventing pregnancy depends on how soon the woman decides to stop having sex. After a few months, many women become very fertile again and begin to think about trying another type of contraception.3) Some women have better success at avoiding pregnancy using condoms than they do using oral contraceptives.4) At times, women experience painful periods while using the pill.5) When there is concern over possible side effects, women should discuss these with their physician.6) Withdrawal of a daily dose of an emergency contraceptive (such as Plan B One Step, ParaGard) may cause bleeding during sexual intercourse for up to 24 hours.7) Your doctor may recommend waiting several weeks following taking oral contraceptives before attempting another form of birth control.8) Oral contraceptives increase the likelihood of infertility and other serious problems such as pelvic inflammatory disease and endometrial cancer.9) Oral contraceptives can sometimes decrease libido.10) A small percentage of women develop severe acne around ovaries or within an abdominal cavity.11) There is some concern regarding certain drugs used to treat cancer such as bisphosphonates, carboplatin, etc., although these drugs generally provide some protection against future cancer.12) Aspirin may affect ovulation and fertility.13) You will need to consult with your healthcare provider about any medication you take including vitamins and herbal supplements.14) Many women report feeling tired and fatigued throughout the day with prolonged use of oral contraceptives.15) Most patients notice temporary nausea and diarrhea (tiredness).16) Women must remain vigilant about monitoring their menstrual cycles and regular check-ups.17) It is important to remember that not all hormonal methods of contraception work as well as others.18) The average length of time taken to achieve menopause varies depending upon age and number of children.19) All medications can interact adversely",126,birth control suppression antral follicle count,-12.236016273498535,61,multimedqa,8,0.5213675213675214,402,2

What about drinking water? Is it safe? What's the risk of getting lead in my drinking water?

Your drinking water may carry lead levels greater than those allowed under EPA standards. Lead contamination can occur naturally in many locations in the United States, but because it occurs at concentrations that cannot be measured directly, lead remains present in your drinking water. The federal lead standard for water contains 1 part per million (ppm) of lead (the lowest level recommended by CDC, which means no more than 0.3 ppm in tap water), while the state guidelines set by your local water authority typically range between 50 and 300 ppm (more than 10-fold higher than EPA's recommendation). To reduce the amount of lead in your water, use filters to remove sediment in faucets and treat your water before drinking, cooking, or showering with it.

In addition, consider using bottled drinking water when possible. Bottled water offers several advantages over regular tap water. For one thing, bottled water eliminates the chemical solvents used to dissolve lead in tap water. It does this",112,symptoms of asthma,-5.127282619476318,72,multimedqa,9,0.34285714285714286,404,9

Health care professionals have been told by their patients that if they do not see any improvement after several weeks, it is probably a sign that something is wrong. This is because symptoms can develop rapidly in some people who go through very severe illness. For example, someone with multiple sclerosis will start seeing a wide range of changes within 3-6 months of diagnosis, but may not show signs of serious illness until a year later.\r


In general, it takes only a few days for many people to become severely ill. Some people experience symptoms that last a week or more. In fact, some people actually have much longer illness than this.\r


A person may suddenly begin showing all kinds of bizarre behavior, including eating strange foods, falling down stairs, getting lost on the street, jumping from moving cars, experiencing extreme panic attacks, and so on. The doctor should be alert to these behaviors, as well as the obvious physical problems such as vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, and dizziness.


Symptoms of Ehlers Danlos syndrome can come on suddenly, often without warning, and then disappear after a time. They usually appear gradually over the course of weeks to months, and can range from mild discomfort, such as occasional stomach aches, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, or headaches, to severe fatigue, blurred vision, numbness/tingling in one side of the body, difficulty breathing, seizures, coma, and death.\r


People with Ehlers Danlos syndrome cannot normally swallow food whole. It's just too painful. So what happens when patients lose control of their bowels? One explanation is that fluids accumulate inside their bodies. When you drink, urine collects around the edges of your stomach. When you vomit, large amounts of liquid fall out onto the floor. This fluid contains many minerals (such as calcium, potassium and magnesium) which can cause kidney stones. \r


It isn't known exactly how water gets into the intestines during vomiting; the fluid accumulates in the small intestine. However, there has been speculation that dehydration causes the accumulation of water in the gastrointestinal tract.

gpt2-large_83,"MS is the progressive disease of the central nervous system that causes paralysis in many limbs with or without loss of function. The most common signs and symptoms include fatigue, pain, and weakness. A person may be able to walk, stand up, sit down, and talk on his or her own but not for more than 3 hours at a time. Symptoms usually subside within 3 months. However, some people experience chronic disability over the course of their lifetime. In addition to having problems walking and even being unable to speak, MS can also impair vision, balance, and coordination. You can help others who are experiencing these same challenges by answering questions related to MS. For example: How often does my body break down protein during physical activity?

How long do I need to rest after exercise?

Do I have to drink soda before meals?

Is it normal for me to sweat excessively when exercising?

What if I don't feel well enough to go to work? What should I do instead? Complete Answer: Your answer to this question is ""Yes,"" because your body does break down protein during physical activity (e.g., running). If you wish to continue doing regular physical activity while receiving treatment for MS, you will need to start consuming protein supplements, such as whey proteins, casein, milk products, and soy or egg protein powder. You will need to monitor your diet to make sure you're getting enough protein throughout the day. If you have severe malnutrition and/or other issues, discuss how to modify your lifestyle and food intake to maximize your nutritional needs while taking MS medications. Question: What is the best way to manage my weight? Complete Answer: This is a great question because we know that there are a number of factors that contribute to MS and weight gain. These factors range from genetics, to medication use, to environmental influences (such as lack of sunlight or exposure to chemicals in indoor environments). While genetics plays an important role, it's not clear what causes weight gain in MS. As mentioned above, there is no single cause. Although there are several genetic risk factors for MS, it's likely that many other factors contribute too, including the following: Age. People with MS tend to have lower levels of the appetite hormones leptin and ghrelin. In fact, those with MS are less responsive to insulin and glucagon. Some researchers believe that increased blood sugar levels caused by diabetes contributes to weight gain in MS patients. Exercise.

What is the best way to know what to expect? Complete Answer: At this point, it's very important for all patients to speak with their doctors before initiating hormonal therapy for gender reassignment surgery because certain side effects can occur during periods when hormones are being taken. In addition to the risks associated with the administration of hormones in excess amounts over long periods of time, there are many serious complications of these treatments that must be addressed before they begin. This includes the possibility of depression, which can be especially problematic for patients who are experiencing a difficult transition from one gender role to another. Additionally, the risk of thrombosis increases significantly upon testosterone treatment, particularly in elderly men who have low blood pressure. There are even cases of severe liver problems associated with testosterone use.

The endocrine system, which controls most biological processes throughout our bodies, works differently in males than females. When testosterone is used for a short period of time, the body produces ""testosterone-like"" substances called estrogens; however, women produce both male and female sex steroids--androgen, progesterone, and others. Estrogen makes up 80% of the total male reproductive hormone production and 90% of the total female reproductive hormone production. With increasing age, the rate of the accumulation of either sex steroid decreases. Consequently, the aging process leads to lower levels of the sex steroids (which can cause changes to skin, hair, nails, bone structure, etc.). These changes to the skeleton increase the likelihood of osteoporosis in some individuals. While estrogen plays a protective role against oste",118,stage 4 triple negative breast cancer treatment,-10.545169830322266,113,multimedqa,9,0.5067264573991032,427,2

gpt2-large_77,"A woman with MS has an increased risk of developing MS because she is exposed to the same virus or immune cells that cause both MS and MS-related pain, fatigue, joint swelling, and other symptoms associated with the disease. There may be many reasons why a woman becomes ill after her menstrual period starts—some might be related to the changes in hormones during pregnancy (premature delivery), childbirth, or postpartum depression (postpartum psychosis). In some women, MS begins as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. Menstrual blood loss often is the cause, but it could also be an exacerbation of other causes such as chronic stress, sleep deprivation, or trauma. Menopausal symptoms can occur suddenly, or they can start with several days before menstruation begins. Some people have no memory of their periods for months at a time. Other people experience mood swings due to the presence of a hormone called oestrogen (the primary female sex hormone) which decreases sexual desire and pleasure. Women who don't ovulate and have been diagnosed with endometriosis will experience persistent vaginal bleeding even when their cycles are normal. However, these menopause symptoms may not come on until later in life, so taking birth control pills during the menstrual cycle isn't always effective. If you suspect your doctor's office might have a history of mistreatment of patients with MS, ask if they've had any problems treating this patient group. If they haven't yet treated them with a new drug, make sure you get it right.\nIf you think you're having a hard time making your way through a standard MS screening questionnaire, call your local community clinic or health department. Ask how long it takes them to collect and process test results. This should help you determine whether they will admit a patient without giving you access to treatment information; most clinics require annual re-testing in order to maintain their accreditation status. If your doctor doesn't know where you live or what your insurance covers, call or visit an organization like the National Association for Personhood. They provide free brochures, pamphlets, and training sessions on personal responsibility, environmental justice, family planning, and abortion rights.

Common Questions and Answers about the Internet

What do you mean when you say that the internet is ""a place where all information is free?"" What does it mean?

Internet sites provide an abundance of information for consumers. There are many different types of web pages available on the Internet that help individuals find information about their health and well being. Consumers can find any type of content by searching on the appropriate keywords.

Do I need to have a computer or smartphone with me at the dentist's office? How often should I check up on my teeth and gums?

The dental office requires each patient to present his/her own personal digital device (smartphone) and access the Internet from that device. As a result, most patients use a smartphone and/or tablet when they visit the doctor's office and stay connected through the Internet. The following questions address these questions.

How frequently should I check up on my teeth and gums?

This question asks how often your dentist would like you to check up on your teeth and gums. If your dentist recommends checking every two weeks, then he/she probably wants to see what you are eating, drinking, smoking, using drugs, stress, medications, or other physical conditions as potential causes of poor oral hygiene.

Are there some things I shouldn't eat while I'm having my teeth cleaned?

While you're checking your teeth and gums, don't forget about food allergies. Many people are allergic to certain foods such as peanuts, tree nuts, dairy products, wheat germ, eggs, seafood, soy products, beans, grains, and legumes. These foods contain chemicals called phytoestrogens which may affect your oral hygiene and overall health. You might also wish to avoid alcohol, cigarettes, caffeine, sugar, fatty foods, and other unhealthy foods.

Which diseases have been linked to diet? Which diseases have not been linked to diet? Why haven't these diseases been associated with diet? Do diets cause disease? Does a healthy diet cause disease? Which diseases have been linked to lack of exercise? Which diseases have not been linked to lack of exercise?

There has been little research into the link between diet and chronic diseases. However, over the past decade, numerous studies have demonstrated links between obesity, high blood pressure, heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, and more to poor nutrition. Obesity is considered a major public health problem because increased calorie consumption leads to weight",105,wisdom tooth cuts gum pain,-13.030769348144531,73,multimedqa,9,0.9240506329113924,406,0
gpt2-large_62,"In this scenario, the disclosure of MS in the workplace would be viewed negatively by coworkers for two main reasons. First, as discussed above, a significant portion of their job is doing research and therefore may have some exposure to MS patients. Second, they might perceive that you personally have or had a family member with MS. They could even consider your employer's decision to fire you. This could lead them to believe that you intentionally concealed or delayed information on MS from them. For these reasons, employees who disclose MS often experience negative reactions from their co-workers, particularly if the employee has been diagnosed with MS himself.

Affects: Information disclosed to an individual employee could cause harm if other people learn that the person has or had MS. These adverse effects include the following:\1\ - Unwarranted fear of retaliation by the employer;\2\ - Fear of loss of employment, reduced earnings, and lost benefits;\3\ - Loss of self esteem;\4\ - Increased risk of harassment and discrimination;\5\ - Decreased productivity because of increased anxiety and depression due to not being able to do certain activities as well as diminished motivation to achieve results;\6\ - Reduced quality of life due to decreased ability to perform the duties needed in the industry;\7\ - Increase in health insurance premiums due to increased costs;\8\ - Reduction of job satisfaction, increased turnover rates, and potential decreases in pay and promotions;\9\ - Disruption of relationships with family members and friends due to stigma associated with MS; and\10\ - Increased costs to society due to increased insurance claims and related costs due to denial of care, hospitalizations, prescriptions, and medication. Some cases may also result in lawsuits, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. To avoid all of the adverse effects outlined above, it is recommended that the employer make a good faith effort to help employees understand the disease. The goal should be to foster a positive relationship between the employee and his/her supervisor. When employees know MS, they feel much more comfortable disclosing any issues regarding MS that might arise. In addition, employers need to seek out support networks (e.g., health clubs, local physician groups) and social services agencies such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Samaritans to address these types of needs. Employers should create policies and procedures to allow an employee with MS to discuss problems without fear of retribution and to identify appropriate treatment options.

gpt2-large_35,"Yes! Ketosis is the ideal condition for all patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, as it induces insulin resistance in a manner that is similar to those of normal healthy individuals. As well, this state causes weight loss when compared to anabolic steroids or low carb diets that have been shown to be effective for diabetics. It also leads to a significant increase in ketone bodies as measured by urine ketones. In addition, ketones increase blood glucose levels which is essential for normal glucose metabolism in our body. When you consume ketone bodies from your food (in either form), they can be used as an alternate fuel source for prolonged periods of time, such as after exercise, while reducing the need to drink large amounts of fluids. This increases performance during any physical activity, especially when combined with training. The ketosis induced by consuming foods containing ketone bodies is most desirable as it can enhance mood, stimulate energy production, reduce inflammation, improve mental functions, and decrease insulin sensitivity. A diet high in protein will not allow for the accumulation of ketones and therefore may result in greater appetite suppression. If you are trying to lose weight, use a diet that has lower fat content than what your current intake. Some research indicates that adding 50 grams of carbohydrate per day is sufficient to help prevent weight regain. For someone who is attempting to gain weight, eating more carbohydrates (especially refined carbs) may actually contribute to weight gain.

How do I know if I am getting enough calories in my diet? Complete Answer: Your body uses approximately 3,000 calories daily. You should aim for at least 1,500 calories a day per pound of lean mass (such as muscle, bone, water, etc.). If you are gaining weight, you will likely need to eat less than this. While there are many factors that go into determining your calorie needs, including your age and sex, the biggest factor contributing to weight gain is simply being overweight. It's critical that we recognize this because weight loss programs designed specifically for women tend to leave them feeling like their ""weight is their problem,"" rather than a primary cause. Therefore, a weight-loss program tailored to men, and men only, requires much better scientific evidence. Another important component of losing weight is maintaining your daily caloric requirements. When you exercise regularly, you are able to burn more calories than if you were sedentary. Additionally, when you avoid fatty foods such as fried foods and fast foods, you must replace these calories by burning up more fiber and other nutrients. Research suggests that eating breakfast improves",35,Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?,-0.1356218755245208,4,multimedqa,9,0.025806451612903226,437,28
gpt2-large_97,"A good dose of exercise is always necessary for optimal health, but too little can cause injury or illness. You should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. If you're over 50 years old, aim for 250 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week. There's no need to wear special gear (such as a heart rate monitor), and it doesn't matter whether you run on flat ground or on hills or on the beach; just don't do it all in one sitting! When you get home from work each day, take a walk around your neighborhood—especially if it's hot outside. This will increase your blood circulation and help reduce stress and burn calories. For most people, this will be enough to keep you feeling fresh throughout the day. And don't forget that exercise also helps with weight control, increases sexual enjoyment, improves mood, reduces the risk of osteoporosis, and even lowers your risk for cancer. The more you know about the importance of exercise, the easier it'll become to find ways to get some extra practice into your daily routine, especially when you realize how much more powerful it really is than most of us think. Exercise can improve your memory, concentration, coordination, and general mental sharpness. It may even help you remember important details about the past, such as where you were when you last saw your family or what your plans are for tomorrow. \nQuestion: side effects of certain drugs\nAnswer: Some medications, including many antidepressants, have serious side effects, such as dizziness, drowsiness, and nausea, especially during extended use. However, only a few of these drugs are known to cause liver damage, so they probably won't harm you or interfere with other treatment programs. Keep in mind that not all side effects are caused by drugs, which means that you could still benefit from taking them.

The pain is caused by the abnormal movement of the finger joints. The cause is unknown.


SUMMARY OF THE ANSWER

Pain in the hands is a result of an overactive sensory system that causes swelling, damage or loss of nerve cells, the nerves that control voluntary muscle action, as well as pain transmission between adjacent structures (such as the muscles). The body's natural response to painful stimuli is pain sensation itself, not the presence or absence of pain receptors on the affected tissue. It has been suggested that these receptors have evolved for defense against infection or injury and therefore may be less sensitive than those involved in involuntary muscle movements such as walking, reaching for objects, etc.[11] Pain perception involves the brain, spinal cord, and endocrine systems - all of which play a significant role in how we perceive pain.\nQuestion: my doctor says that I should not use certain medicines because they can increase my risk of kidney stones\nAnswer: If you're thinking of taking any medications with caffeine, such as energy drinks, coffee, tea, cola, etc., think again! Some drugs that are thought to raise your risk of developing kidney stones include alcohol, aspirin, and the antacids used in some cold medicine. Additionally, certain antibiotics, corticosteroids, antihistamines, diuretics, antipsychotics, sedatives, sleeping pills, and steroidal hormones like birth control pills will raise your risk of developing kidney stones.


WHAT TO DO NEXT

When looking for information on potential side effects from medications, it helps to keep in mind the following guidelines:

Look up the drug's name and dosage information. You'll find out what kind of dosage is recommended for each medication, whether the drug affects blood pressure, heart rate, blood sugar levels, appetite, sexual function, or other related symptoms. Look up the manufacturer's label information. This might contain warnings about high doses or interactions, the maximum daily dose, and more. Make sure that the side effect information is based on real data, rather than rumors. Also make sure that the information contains the most current information available. For example, if you were told to take a particular medication after having surgery or when you received chemotherapy for cancer treatment, this isn't always true. When looking at the ingredients list, don't just look for one substance; try to see all possible combinations.

Complete Answer: The longer you've been exposed to allergens like trees and peanuts, the more likely you will develop an allergy. For example, there's no need to wait until a child has asthma to start taking asthma medicine (some children do develop asthma as early as age 4). However, not all children with allergies eventually develop an allergy, so it's best to let your doctor know when you notice symptoms of an allergic reaction (such as hives or runny nose) or notice a change in your symptoms (for example, fever). After your doctor determines whether you're at risk of developing an allergy, he or she may prescribe medication (called an antihistamine, cortisone, etc.) to help prevent severe allergic reactions. As with other conditions, some medicines work by blocking specific receptors on your body, but many others affect both the immune system and the body as a whole. It takes time for these changes to take effect, though, and your ability to fight off allergies should gradually improve over time. To find out more about how to treat eczema, visit our eczema page.

In general, the most effective diet is that which promotes optimal nutritional status. The following list may be considered guidelines for dietary recommendations based on a variety of evidence from clinical trials in humans. It does not imply any specific foods or nutrients should be avoided, but rather that they should be taken into consideration when making choices. \r

The use of medications such as metformin (which reduces blood sugar levels), insulin (also called ""subcutaneous"" insulin injections), and/or oral contraceptives (such as ethinyloestradiol) can cause weight gain due to their side effects. These drugs also increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. In addition, some studies have shown that many other medications can cause weight loss by decreasing appetite. For example, certain antihistamines (including Benadryl, Prozac, and others) reduce hunger. Thus, it is important that an individual evaluate the potential adverse effect(s) of prescribed medications.

In case of concern, consult with your doctor before initiating a new lifestyle program. If you experience significant changes in your weight, please talk to your physician. As well, it is recommended that you see a health care professional immediately if you notice any of these symptoms;

Complete Answer: Our system allows us to recognize different diagnoses, so by reviewing our patient records and making a connection between them, we may discover that there might be many people suffering from similar problems or with similar symptoms. For example, we might find that one person was diagnosed with ""cognitive impairment"" but another suffered from ""anxiety."" We would then refer both to a doctor for evaluation, along with their family members. This also makes it easier for caregivers to stay informed of all patients undergoing care and to make sure they receive the necessary support.

Cognitive Impairment and the Use of Treatment Options

Many people experience cognitive impairments after treatment for depression. Many people also experience cognitive impairment following treatment for chronic pain. However, cognitive impairment may interfere with your ability to obtain needed medication, so we have provided an article summarizing the current literature to help you make informed decisions regarding whether to use certain therapies.

The CDPH has received reports of two cases where individuals experienced cognitive impairment in response to taking antidepressant medication. In both cases, these individuals were treated as outpatients at academic medical centers. The initial assessment showed no significant impairment. Several weeks later, the patient experienced symptoms similar to those associated with major depressive disorder and developed clinically meaningful psychiatric manifestations during a period of approximately four months. These included anxiety, insomnia, irritability, panic attacks, paranoia, impulsivity, hostility, aggression, delusions, hallucinations, depression, sleep disturbances, loss of concentration, and poor judgment. These symptoms did not recur when discontinuing treatment. At this point, it appears the patient's cognitive impairment continued despite discontinuation of the antidepressant medication. This case demonstrates that cognitive impairment can result from adverse reactions to antidepressants. It is important to note that most antidepressant drugs are safe and effective for treating depressed mood, but other factors may play a role in causing cognitive impairment. The results of this case underscore the need to carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of antidepressant therapy before initiating treatment.

If you suspect that you or someone else you know might be experiencing signs and symptoms consistent with cognitive impairment related to antidepressant use, please call our toll free number 1-800-332-0166 or contact us online.

gpt2-large_54,"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic disease characterized by progressive loss of muscle strength, vision, hearing, balance, and other body functions that affect daily life. The condition usually begins in childhood or adolescence and can be lifelong. You can get MS if you have a mutation in a gene called the X chromosome (male sex chromosomes). Your risk for developing MS increases with each passing year. Women and men who inherit one copy of this same mutated gene from both parents will develop MS, too. If you have multiple copies of the damaged gene, your chances of getting MS increase. People with this disorder often have physical problems like arthritis, but they also may experience cognitive issues, such as difficulty with memory and attention span, which can make them less productive at work and school. Although some people with MS have a milder form of the illness, others progress rapidly. As more research on MS continues, our understanding will improve; however, there's no cure.

To understand BPD, it helps to know some basic facts about this disorder. The following list provides more details and references. Some terms used in this article may be unfamiliar or have different meanings than they do in other articles.\r

Treatment options include medication, counseling, and psychotherapy, but treatment generally includes a combination of these approaches.\r

The most common type of BPD treatment involves medication for mood disorders; the medications may involve different classes of antidepressants or antipsychotics as well as various types of anti-psychotic drugs such as benzodiazepines (such as Valium), divalproex sodium (such as Klonopin) or lorazepam (which produces a short-term memory loss called slurring that has been reported to occur in up to 20% of people with BPD). There may also be treatments involving neuroleptics, including lithium, which can help some people recover from BPD without medication. Treatment typically begins after people stop taking their meds completely, usually within 2 to 3 months. For severe cases of BPD, this might take longer because of possible side effects like sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. In addition to medication, many people find it helpful to talk to others who have suffered from BPD, especially relatives or friends of patients. These conversations can offer support and insight into the reasons behind feelings of inadequacy, hopelessness, self-hatred, and isolation that many people experience. Other forms of treatment may be available, depending on how long you need to wait before receiving any treatment or if other treatments work better for you. Talk with your doctor or psychiatrist about what's best for you.\r

gpt2-large_85,"\nAnswer: \nMS is an autoimmune disease that causes relapses and recurrences of the same symptoms from one year or longer ago. The most common form of MS is MSSP (Multiple Sclerosis Progressive Multiple System). This type of MS usually begins with pain in muscles and joints as well as stiffness in your limbs, but it can also include fatigue, vision changes, loss of balance, and joint stiffness.

A diagnosis of MS is based on three factors: physical examination findings; laboratory tests and imaging results; and clinical observations made by an MS specialist. \nQuestion: What is the difference between MS and a neurodegenerative disorder? Complete Answer: \nAnswer: \nThe main difference between MS and other disorders is that while they cause brain damage, their underlying cause may be found in the central nervous system (CNS), where many diseases such as Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, Huntington's Disease and ALS are located. In contrast, MS affects many parts of the body - including muscle, nerve and bone - which make up the ""body"" and so are not part of the CNS. There are only a handful of diseases that affect the entire human body and none have been shown to affect the brain. For example, people who develop multiple sclerosis do not experience any neurological impairment. However, there are some genetic variations in the immune system that could increase the risk for developing MS. These differences will need to be studied further before we know what causes the development of MS.

Some other diseases and conditions that occur together with MS, like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, are known as autoimmune diseases. It can take several years for these illnesses to begin appearing on MRI scans. Most commonly, MS occurs at an early age. The risk increases later in life when children or teenagers start having more serious difficulties and more severe symptoms appear. As you get older, the problems go away and you might never even notice them. But if you have MS, even during treatment, you may still experience chronic pain in the lower back and neck, numbness or tingling sensations in your arms and legs, depression or anxiety, and trouble sleeping.

If you find yourself experiencing side effects associated with your MS treatments, tell your doctor right away. Your physician or pharmacist should ask whether you're using medicines such as corticosteroids (used to treat asthma) and immunosuppressants (used to control high cholesterol and blood pressure). If they suspect something wrong, they'll probably",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-6.423869609832764,114,multimedqa,9,0.5786802030456852,410,4
gpt2-large_123,"If you have recently changed your diet or medications and find that you get the same symptoms in different parts of your body, it's likely due to thyroid hormone imbalance. Symptoms may include weight gain, headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, decreased sex drive, blurred vision, rapid heartbeat, low blood pressure, skin rashes, insomnia, depression, constipation, sleep apnea, irritability, joint pain, muscle spasms, dizziness, and muscle weakness. You can also use these questions to determine if you have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (HRT) and other conditions associated with hyperthyroidism. \r

If you think your thyroid is causing these symptoms, talk with your doctor. Your doctor will probably ask you some personal information about your thyroid function and its role in your daily life, including whether you smoke. It may help to bring up this topic at an appointment, but make sure to tell your doctor about any past history of severe thyroid problems (such as Hashimoto's Thyroiditis). She'll then be able to advise you on how to best manage your thyroid symptoms and make recommendations for specific treatment options. \nQuestion: Do I need thyroid medication? Complete Answer: To protect against damage from excessive exposure to iodine, most people who don't have Hashimoto's should not take T4 (the normal form of iodine). However, many patients do not respond well to antihistamines because they reduce the level of iodized salt circulating in their bloodstreams. This increases the risk of hyperthyroidism. In those cases, you might consider getting an iodine supplement, which contains iodine salts and helps prevent iodine deficiency. As a general rule, however, T4 is best used when you aren't taking antihistamines. For more information, see ""How much iodine?"" in Chapter 3. \r

In certain circumstances, such as severe allergies, high levels of thyroid hormones can cause serious harm. So check with your doctor before trying to treat yourself using iodine supplements or even iodinated table salt. \nQuestions: How long does my thyroid function last after being treated with thyroid medicine?\nAnswer: Your thyroid gland takes several months to become fully functional again after treatment. A patient with Hashimoto's will generally experience no symptoms until about two years after starting his/her treatment, during which time he/she will typically be feeling better than usual and able to perform basic tasks like bathing. In the meantime, there is very little data on long-term effects of thyroid therapy, and few studies",123,hypothyroidism symptoms,-7.941736221313477,71,multimedqa,9,0.4382716049382716,393,4

It results when children or adolescents have too much energy and not enough sleep, leading them to be hyperactive in school and on the playgrounds. \nQuestion: What should I do if my child has ADHD? Complete Answer:

Your daughter or son may need some help with their ADHD symptoms. She/he needs to learn how to manage her energy level by staying in control at home, avoiding risky behavior, and learning skills such as time management. Your son may also need advice on how best to keep his emotions under control by making sure he stays calm and focused. They need to also make sure they don't let other people get into their head while they're stressed out. Finally, your son or daughter will want to take a good look around themselves before taking any action they think will cause trouble. Many times we see kids who have ADD/ADHD go through life without noticing how many things could be causing problems for them. This is especially true when it comes to relationships. If you feel the situation is not getting better within your family, seek professional help. You may be able to help your child to become more self-aware, but even then you may not be able to fix this problem until after puberty. At that point, there are some changes in brain chemistry that come with the change in hormones (e.g., testosterone). Some parents worry that a kid's mood might have changed as well because they think that just being around another person makes a difference. That isn't always the case either. There is no way to know for certain what a teen feels or thinks because of their interactions with others. When looking at the big picture, many teens don't act like they were raised differently than everyone else - they simply didn't notice the changes over time. In addition, because of these hormonal changes, teens are going through a period of transition between childhood and adulthood. Because teenagers are still growing, it's often hard to tell if they are dealing with their own issues or they are having issues related to their peers. Sometimes, they find ways to deal with these issues on their own. Other times, they are able to work through it together. To prevent other kids from hurting your child, try to teach him/her healthy coping strategies. For example, talking with your kid about things they can do to stop acting out will usually solve the issue. Another",107,medication adhd anxiety,-0.0171046089380979,0,multimedqa,9,0.0,435,4

Common Questions About MSD

What does 'Primary' mean?


When someone has MSD, he/she usually has both primary and secondary MSD. Primary MSD refers to symptoms caused by the primary illness. Secondary MSD refers to secondary illnesses caused by the second disease state. Some people with a secondary diagnosis of MSD will have no pain, fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or joint swelling associated with their second MSD. Many patients without symptoms will respond well to treatment even though they do not have two separate types of disease. In fact, some physicians will diagnose MSD without knowing that there may be secondary forms. Therefore, it is important to obtain a thorough physical examination, laboratory tests, and other testing before making any decision regarding treatment. If you suspect that your patient has secondary MSD, or if you feel uncomfortable asking questions about MSD due to the sensitivity of the subject matter, seek assistance from a physician or psychologist knowledgeable in the topics discussed below.",55,How to manage multiple sclerosis?,-4.480088233947754,133,multimedqa,9,0.540650406504065,342,14

Medical Conditions Medical Conditions Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is the most commonly diagnosed type of MS, affecting approximately 1% of adults worldwide.\2\ CFS can be defined as the accumulation of several symptoms over time that worsen with age; for example, you may experience persistent headaches, fatigue, weakness, muscle pain, sensitivity to light/sound/taste/smell, decreased concentration, mental confusion, difficulty concentrating, difficulty seeing clearly, and difficulties sleeping. Symptoms of CFS typically begin on days when your immune system becomes weakened by illness, such as flu or an infection. You may also develop other signs and symptoms like poor appetite, loss of libido, sleep problems, depression, and irritability, and may even become confused or disoriented. You should consult your healthcare professional if you notice any signs or symptoms consistent with CFS. Most cases of CFS go unrecognized and untreated. Other Causes of Fatigue and Illness in MS \3\ The next question is ""How is my body able to cope with this stress?"" A person experiencing long term chronic fatigue will be able to make use of their body's energy reserves, but they need to do so at least partially during the day. It takes energy to carry out daily activities such as breathing, eating, and moving. This energy comes from glucose stored in fat cells. If these stores are depleted, then people suffering from chronic fatigue have trouble regulating how much food they eat or how often they exercise. They can't handle the heat, cold, or moisture and therefore risk dehydration and malnutrition. People who suffer from chronic fatigue have been shown to lose an average of 25 pounds per year within three years, but many more people don't gain weight, although some women do. While some studies show that individuals suffering from chronic fatigue are less likely than others to get treatment for their illness, there is still no consensus on what factors cause CFS. Some researchers argue that the cause is genetic, while others suspect it is environmental. Others suggest that the disease has developed due to hormonal changes in older persons. Still others think that both genetics and environmental factors play a role. Many research groups are working together to better understand how the disease develops. Another important issue is whether CFS affects every part of the brain.

People who exercise regularly should also try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity each week. \nQuestion: Should I try to control my diet? Complete Answer: Although it is unlikely that a controlled diet would improve most people's overall health, you should definitely talk with your healthcare provider about changing your eating habits if necessary. As long as your daily caloric intake remains within limits set by your healthcare provider and does not exceed the recommended range, you will likely still benefit from lifestyle changes like reducing saturated fat consumption and increasing fruits and vegetables and healthy fats like olive oil. Also, it is possible to increase the amount of protein in your diet, which may decrease your chances of having high blood pressure, which is associated with an increased risk of stroke, heart disease, and diabetes. The American Heart Association recommends eating 6 to 8 servings of lean meat per day and limiting red meat to no more than two ounces per day, while the Institute of Medicine suggests six to eight servings of whole grains, seven to nine ounces of fruit and vegetables, and three to five servings of beans.",22,my risk for developing type 2 diabetes,-4.098006725311279,103,multimedqa,9,0.412,428,15

Sleep disorders and problems related to sleep generally affect more individuals than the majority of illnesses. Many people who suffer from an MS diagnosis experience both insomnia and daytime tiredness due to poor sleep hygiene. However, sleep disturbances do not cause MS.

Sleep disturbances may arise from excessive sleepiness caused by a variety of conditions. Some of these include:

Inability to fall asleep at night

Tiredness during the day

Nightmares or vivid dreams during the night

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

Depression

Asthma/rheumatoid arthritis

Osteoarthritis

Parkinson's disease

A history of drug abuse or addiction

Itching or pricking on the arms or legs

Coughing up blood after coughing or sneezing

Diarrhea that lasts for longer than 24 hours

Other diseases which also cause severe sleep disturbance include:

Multiple Sclerosis - Multiple sclerosis is one of several neurological diseases, which affects nerves throughout the body, such as the brain, spinal cord, optic nerve and peripheral nervous system. MS occurs when damage to the central nervous system leads to inflammation, swelling of the skin, loss of motor skills, progressive weakness and eventually death. There are two main forms of MS. Primary MS develops within three to six months of the initial diagnosis. Secondary MS develops within eight to 10 years of the original diagnosis. Symptoms typically begin two to five years after onset and last about 18 months to three years. Treatment is aimed at improving function, reducing disability, preventing new episodes and helping patients maintain their quality of life over time.

The most commonly treated form of MS involves the use of drugs called anti-MS therapies. These drugs work by inhibiting inflammation, slowing down progression of the disease, decreasing the number of relapses and increasing some symptoms. In addition, they act on specific areas of the immune system such as the white matter and spleen. Most of the treatment takes place before symptoms develop.


Multiple Sclerosis can be diagnosed based upon the presence of a microscopic lesion known as a sclerosis microvascularity or'mVLM'. This is a thin, translucent cell layer at the periphery of the CNS. Mice with mVLM have been shown to have significant deficits in learning, memory and visual",93,Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?,-0.0072474665939807,0,multimedqa,9,0.0,385,30

The MMR vaccine is given by injection into four points on the body. What should be done if someone has a fever during or after their MMR vaccination? Complete Answer: \nIn rare cases, it may be necessary to treat children who have been exposed to an outbreak of mumps at school with corticosteroids or other antiemetics. Such treatment can lead to severe complications, including death. If the child has had a previous allergic reaction to the MMR vaccine or another vaccine containing live virus, and that reaction continues, the child should be referred for evaluation as soon as possible. Children should receive regular follow-up visits until they are no longer considered at risk for measles exposure due to an immune response (such as from having received an MMR vaccine). Question: Which hepatitis B vaccines do you recommend?\nComplete Answer: For adults, we recommend hepatitis B vaccine. For adolescents 12 years and older, we recommend hepatitis A vaccine. \nFor infants who are less than six months old, there are also two shots: one for hepatitis B and one for hepatitis C. It is best to start these vaccinations before the onset of symptoms of hepatitis. Both hepatitis B and hepatitis C vaccines are available over the counter. In addition, all three doses of hepatitis B vaccine are recommended for pregnant women, women who plan to become pregnant within 6 months of giving birth, and women who are breast feeding. All women who are sexually active should get hepatitis B vaccine at least 3 months before starting or returning to sexual activity. Children younger than 9 years of age and adolescents 10 years or older should only receive hepatitis B vaccine once every 2 years.

This could lead to problems later in life that may be more difficult to resolve.\nQuestion: Does having children affect my ability to travel?\nAnswer: The amount of time your child spends at home will vary according to their age and needs. You should inform yourself when planning trips as well as how long it might take before your child can return home safely. Most airlines allow passengers with children under 6 years old to carry one bag (up to 2kg) for free during their entire flight while they're at the airport or while waiting for an early boarding clearance. This does not apply if you plan to travel back to your home country. As a result, if you don't want your children to fly but still need them around, consider letting them stay home longer than usual. For example, instead of flying from Japan to Taiwan, let them travel in the afternoon and return home by evening. When making these arrangements, remember to pack them into comfortable, lightweight seats so they won't feel cramped while traveling. In addition, make sure that they get enough sleep! \/ Question: How does the government protect me against contracting hepatitis B?\nAnswer: Hepatitis B infection is rare in Western countries. A person infected with hepatitis B can contract hepatitis C, which causes liver cancer. However, the majority of cases of hepatitis B in West Africa are caused by people living with HIV. Because there isn't much risk associated with contracting hepatitis B through sex, most travelers avoid this route altogether. To help prevent infection, follow these steps: 1. Avoid sexual contact until after a recent blood test indicates you are no longer at high risk.

2. Wash all surfaces that come in direct contact with any part of your body before sharing anything with someone else.

3. Stay hydrated throughout the day.

4. Take medications that block the virus' transmission such as anti-viral drugs or oral contraceptives as directed.

5. Clean your mouth frequently with mild soap and water. Never use toilet tissue or paper towels to clean the teeth.

6. Carry a bottle of mouthwash for use in emergencies. It is recommended that men wash off after each ejaculation and women wash off after every bowel movement.

There are no vaccines available to prevent MS, but there are many preventive measures that may make it less likely. Your doctor might recommend: Getting regular physicals;

Taking pills every day to lower the level of inflammation in the joints, muscles, blood vessels, and brain;

Treating certain medications (such as beta blockers);

Lie face down in a supine position and lie with your head facing up so that your shoulders rest comfortably over the tops of your legs. Your wrists, elbows, and knees should remain straight throughout this stretch. Try not to lift your hips off the ground during this movement. You can also use a neutral grip while doing the above stretches.

Hold for 10 to 20 seconds and exhale, then repeat 5 more times until fatigued or the pain is gone.

Note: The muscles in the neck and shoulder area have to be stretched because they hold the back of our heads from falling forward when we sit or stand. This leads to poor posture and neck injuries.

The body uses its own body's immune response to try to protect itself against infection. However, if this process is not balanced, you could experience a weakened immune system. You might feel tired or nauseous. Your body will also produce antibodies to battle the infection. If your immune system is still weak, you would have to use drugs like steroids or antibiotics to treat the infection.\nQuestion: What do I take while taking acetaminophen?\nAnswer: Acetaminophen is used to relieve heat and pain in many situations, such as when you're sick, working out, swimming, bathing, playing sports, etc. To see how acetaminophen works in each situation, check out this article on myHealthWeb.com.

Answer: A psychiatric emergency room (PE) is one of several specialized units operated by health care providers who specialize in treating individuals who present with symptoms indicating a potential threat of serious harm to themselves, others, or society. These patients typically require long-term treatment, with intensive supervision, to correct underlying psychiatric causes of their problems. PEs often consist of an internal medicine team, nurses, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists and clinical social workers. An emergency department (ED) is a place where the staff treats persons presenting with acute illness or injury, which may necessitate immediate admission. In addition to providing necessary care and support during these times, PEs also serve as places for community outreach, education and cultural learning. There is no single definition of a psychiatric emergency room, but it generally includes both a psychiatric hospital and a residential center. The majority of PEs are licensed under state laws. Many states now have specific licensing requirements for PEs.

Answer: Searching your physician's prescription record using the keywords ""Prescription Drug"" will give you all the relevant data needed to answer this question. If your physician has prescribed medications in the past, a search will reveal whether the medication was issued before July 1, 2010. If the medication was approved after July 1, 2010, you must ask your doctor why he or she chose to write the medication. For example, how did you learn that the medication was being prescribed? Did your physician offer you alternative options? Was there another drug you could be taking without side effects?

gpt2-large_108,"Diarrhea is not the same as cholera or typhoid fever. The first two of these diseases can be prevented by proper sanitation practices. Cholera occurs when water enters the mouth from a contaminated source (like an open sewer) and causes vomiting that may lead to dehydration. Typhoid fever occurs when bacteria enter the bloodstream and cause diarrhea.

Chronic Diarrhea

A person who has been infected with HIV may get more severe bouts of diarrhea in the future. It's also known as AIDS. People who have had one bout of AIDS will generally never get another, even if they do receive treatment. If you've already received treatment for HIV, you're no longer contagious for HIV. However, there may still be some people who could become exposed. These individuals should receive appropriate care, such as testing for hepatitis B and C before getting tested again.

People often report getting worse after having recently experienced a bout of diarrhea. This does not necessarily mean they contracted diarrhea because it may have been caused by their viral infection, but rather that they began experiencing symptoms of diarrhea at a later date and then continued to experience them during their next bout of diarrhea. For example, a woman may start having bad cramps right after she has been diagnosed with HIV, and her cramping may persist for weeks. After several weeks, the cramps subside, leaving the woman feeling ""normal,"" as though nothing happened. But this is simply false. She has now developed a new and very serious disease—cholera—which requires immediate attention.

So what is the difference between a bout of diarrhea and a cholera outbreak? You'll need to check with your doctor to find out. Once you find out the answer, call your doctor immediately. He/she might refer you to your local Public Health Department office for further evaluation.

This name was coined by Dr. Harold Mittleman of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1979, and it has since been used widely by other physicians. The term ``Ehlers Danlos Syndrome'' is not recognized by any government agency or medical association in the United States. 2. Some people with this condition have a mutation in one of the proteins that make up an enzyme known as Cdk5. Other people have mutations in the protein that makes up another enzyme that makes up a protein called Aghd2. These enzymes are involved in making the protective membranes around cells called endomysium. The proteins made by these two enzymes are important for keeping cells alive when they are exposed to toxins.\n\mrs-joseph@mail.nih.gov> References: <http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/factsheets/ehls/> \/ nnnn \/ nnnn 3. People with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome do not normally have signs or symptoms until their adult years. They can develop them only if they're treated early enough. 4. Your condition may be linked to a particular food you ate as a child. If you've eaten foods high in gluten, dairy products and eggs, your disease may be related to those foods. In some people, there's no relationship between certain foods and Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, but there's also no connection at all. 5. Some people who have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome experience muscle weakness, stiffness, loss of coordination, leg swelling and spasms. Some people have little or no loss of balance or coordination while on the floor. 6. Although many people think they have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, most doctors don't consider it a serious condition. 7. While this type of disorder usually affects people who eat foods high in gluten, many people who eat similar foods can become mildly ill from eating foods low in gluten without developing a true food allergy. 8. When you see your physician, he'll want to know what foods he thinks you might be allergic to -- which ones should be avoided -- and how much time you think you need. 9. You shouldn't stop taking your medicines unless your doctor says you should. 10. If you think you might have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, call your doctor right away.

gpt2-large_83,"Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. The immune system attacks the body's own tissues in order to fight off infections and other threats from foreign materials. Symptoms of MS include fatigue, numbness or pain on one side of the body, difficulty concentrating, memory loss, inability to speak, blurred vision, problems walking, and stiffness in your legs. There are many different types of MS, including relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), primary progressive MS (PPMS), and secondary progressive MS (SPMS). These diseases occur when there is another autoimmune disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, or Hashimoto's thyroiditis. RRMS occurs most frequently in people between 35 and 55 years old with no previous history of MS. PPMS develops slowly and usually begins before age 20; it often first appears during the first few months of life. SPMS can develop later than RRMS and may not be obvious until age 60 or older. When you are told by your doctor that you have an MS diagnosis, he or she will ask for additional information. For example, they might request blood tests and/or physical exams. They also want to know if you have experienced any other symptoms that indicate that you might have other conditions that could affect your outlook for recovery. If you do experience these symptoms and think it might be related to your MS diagnosis, talk to your doctor. You should tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms: Increased fatigue, headaches, muscle cramps, weakness, feeling unwell, unexplained weight gain, dizziness, nausea, or vomiting

Trouble sleeping

Cognitive impairment

Frequent thoughts about death or suicide, suicidal thoughts or attempts

A change in eating patterns, particularly a decrease in appetite

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain

Sudden mood swings, unusual behavior, or sleep disturbances

Loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, such as watching television, playing video games, driving cars, going to the movies, or taking part in physical activity

Abnormal dreams, vivid nightmares, or flashbacks During this time period, your doctor will need to carefully examine your MS symptoms and ask questions. They will also try to identify other causes, such as alcohol or drug use. It is important to note that your doctor does not prescribe medications alone.

gpt2-large_77,"Menopausal symptoms may be caused by the damage done to the ovaries during the menopausal process. The ovary is responsible for producing hormones needed to maintain the body's normal temperature, stimulate bone growth, improve hair growth, and protect against cancer. A woman with estrogen-dependent menopausal symptoms will have higher levels of these hormones in her blood than those who don't have them. As a result, her body produces more of its own progesterone, which plays an important role in helping women lose weight and regulate menstruation. This can cause some serious side effects including fatigue, muscle weakness, irritability, nausea, breast tenderness, increased menstrual bleeding, headaches and mood changes. Women diagnosed with MS usually develop symptoms between ages 35 and 45; however, there are many different reasons why certain individuals get MS instead of others. Many factors contribute to MS, from genetic mutations to environmental exposures that change your immune system or brain chemistry. However, there is no single test or treatment that helps all women. Your doctor will help you determine what is causing your symptoms and how best to treat them. It's also important to remember that symptoms are not always due to physical changes, such as loss of memory. Instead, they're often caused by psychological problems or emotional trauma. You must make sure that whatever you try to solve your problem with is working before you start taking medication again.

Q: What is sex hormone replacement therapy (HRT)?A: HRT works by stimulating production of new cells in the adrenal glands. These cells produce testosterone and other hormones necessary for maintaining healthy sexual function. Although hormones are created naturally in most people over their lifetimes, HRT is intended to stop the excessive production of these hormones so they can be converted into less dangerous ones called estrogens. Estrogen reduces inflammation in the adrenals, the part of the endocrine system that controls several functions including fat storage and metabolism. If there isn't enough of this natural product left in circulation, it causes excess tissue buildup and enlargement of the female reproductive organs, resulting in infertility. Estrogen is also important for maintaining normal blood pressure. By blocking the conversion of estrogen into estrogen-like compounds, HRT prevents severe low blood sugar attacks and diabetes mellitus (type 2). Some medications that include HRT work by inhibiting the action of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) that breaks down prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), one of the main building blocks of PGE2. Because COX has been linked to",77,How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?,-0.4218018352985382,3,multimedqa,10,0.012396694214876033,410,16

Complete Answer: By providing them with accurate information on their symptoms, medications, treatments, and the options available to prevent, manage, or cure these diseases. You will also help people choose and follow up with physicians and other professionals in their respective communities that can provide relevant patient care. Question: Do you support or oppose state and federal legislation against the practice of medicine? Are there any specific laws that you would like to see modified in order to allow for your own work as an advocate and educator?\nComplete Answer: I am personally in favor of both legislative changes and educational efforts aimed at reducing stigma and discrimination.

gpt2-large_62,"The answer is simple. They will not find it believable that an employee with MS could be working at a multinational corporation. Therefore, there may be some resistance on the part of the managers to this information. However, they have to acknowledge the fact that MS can occur in employees even when they do not present symptoms or signs. This is because most people with MS have abnormal levels of white blood cells (e.g., CD4) which makes them vulnerable to infection by harmful bacteria such as MRSA. Furthermore, MS patients experience chronic pain and debilitating fatigue due to their disability. In addition, people with MS face other important health challenges, such as being exposed to various toxins while working at high temperatures. These activities have caused some people to develop the condition. It is therefore imperative for management to address these issues. To help reduce this risk, we recommend that companies make sure that all employees with MS receive accurate information regarding the disease and take appropriate precautions against exposure to harmful substances. \nQuestion: should I ask my manager if he/she knows someone who has MS? Answer: Yes, the question should be asked. It is recommended that you discuss whether any person with MS has ever worked at your company, and then give him/her an opportunity to describe what it's like to be part of the company culture. It is also recommended that you seek out experts to speak with. For example, a professional nurse from a local hospital would be a great resource for someone with MS. Also, consider consulting with a doctor who specializes in treating MS; however, you should not rely solely upon the advice of doctors. A professional physician might not be available. Finally, it is important that you remember that MS affects only a small percentage of the population. You should never assume that any individual you meet is suffering from MS. All individuals with MS have different symptoms, experiences, and abilities.

However, some patients with severe forms of diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) who have had unsuccessful treatments for several years will be more likely to benefit from a ketogenic diet. \nQuestion: Should I take medication to control my condition?\nComplete Answer: The treatment options for the person taking insulin depend on the individual's symptoms and personal preference, but any medication that lowers blood glucose concentrations should generally not interfere with the body's ability to use carbohydrates. There are many medications available for individuals whose symptoms include extreme thirst, hunger, diarrhea, vomiting, sweating, dizziness, muscle weakness, irritability, lack of concentration, trouble sleeping, nausea, and/or constipation. Some medications are also prescribed for individuals with certain psychiatric conditions, such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Other medications include antihistamines and antiepileptic drugs for epilepsy, anticonvulsants for seizures and glaucoma, antiplatelets and thrombolytics for heart attacks, and antihypertensives for hypertension. Most people taking anabolic steroids, particularly those using diuretic supplements, will require additional monitoring when switching from oral contraceptives to other types of hormone replacement therapy. For these reasons, there must always be consideration given to the potential side effects of all different kinds of medications. This includes the potential risks of these medications and how they might interact with each other, including interactions between different medicines for a particular disease. If you do decide to start taking anabolic steroid medications at this time, make sure to discuss with your healthcare provider how frequently you should change dosage. For example, if you're taking an SSRI at night while you sleep, you may want to switch to another one before bedtime, to ensure the best possible results. When looking at the potential benefits and risks of taking anabolic steroid medications, remember that only a few factors can determine whether something works for you or not; therefore, there is no single answer. You should consider a variety of factors, including both physical and psychological aspects. For example, if your primary goal is weight loss, then testosterone replacement therapy may improve your mood and help you manage weight better by improving self esteem.

Some people who have chronic illnesses still think they are cured after having taken certain medicines for months or even years. They seem to forget that there may still be a lot of negative side effects from taking medications that have no effect whatsoever in treating a disease. People often become so upset by these side effects that they never try again. Unfortunately, most of them go on to become chronically ill themselves as a result. However, if we use the right treatments while continuing to maintain our lifestyle, we're more likely to avoid these complications. Asking ""How come nobody is telling me?"" is always the wrong answer to ask.

How do you treat my chronic pain?\nQuestion: How long should I wait before switching medications? Complete Answer: A patient's response to anti-inflammatory medications depends on their condition and how severe they were at diagnosis and progression. However, most physicians will recommend continuing medication only if there is evidence of continued improvement. Some examples include a decrease in pain intensity, improvement in sleep patterns, reduction in nighttime stiffness, and/or a change in frequency of attacks.

For example, an allergy to mold or pollen can cause allergic asthma, which means it affects the lungs too. And if you're prone to hay fever and other viral infections, your doctor may want to check your immune system. In general, though, you should not have severe or ongoing pain without having received appropriate medical care within the past 2 weeks.

Step 1: Make sure the email addresses you entered appear exactly as they appeared on your voter registration card.

What causes the ""dancing baby"" syndrome? The dance party phenomenon is typically caused by a combination of stress, exhaustion, and excessive alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Stress can increase your risk for miscarriage if you drink heavily while pregnant (and even more so if you take drugs such as oxycodone or barbiturates). And high levels of stress may also play a role in other types of birth trauma—for example, the inability to get out of bed after childbirth, which can cause postpartum depression or withdrawal symptoms. While both of these effects do occur with pregnancy, they have different etiologies and treatments.\nAnxiety

A key symptom of anxiety and panic attacks is the sudden onset of episodes lasting longer than 3 hours. These episodes usually start suddenly and are followed by short periods of calm and relaxation. This often includes rapid movements around the house, screaming, crying, or rocking back and forth. If you experience any of these symptoms at all on or after a certain day, it's important to seek help immediately. Other signs of anxiety include feeling cold, anxious, and irritable. You may be sweating, panting, breathing faster, or having difficulty sleeping. Often times these behaviors are linked to the fear of losing control over situations involving anxiety. It is not uncommon for women who suffer from an episode of anxiety to lose their temper and yell or swear out loud in front of others. \nIf you feel that you are being excessively stressed or tense in public places or your ability to relax has been disrupted, talk to someone about taking some time off work and getting counseling. See our article on the best ways to avoid becoming too stressed before, during, and after pregnancy for additional information. Stressful Workplace

Even though there are many positive benefits associated with working outside the home, excessive stress can also be harmful, especially when combined with stressors related to the job itself. Even mild stress at work might result in poor performance and burnout. For instance, one study showed that workers whose jobs involved repetitive tasks experienced less satisfaction with their lives when compared to those who did not perform repetitive activities at work.

Medical Information:

About Diabetes:

Diabetes is defined as having impaired control over blood sugar levels which are caused by abnormal blood vessel growth and contraction. In most cases, the cause is unknown. However, there may be genetic factors in some cases, such as hereditary hyperglycemia, and environmental factors, such as exposure to certain foods, alcohol or exercise.

About Insulin Resistance:

Insulin resistance occurs when body fat stores increase because of insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. This results in excess production of glucose from stored glycogen. As a result, blood glucose will rise slowly when blood sugars are lower than normal or when insulin sensitivity is high, resulting in hypoglycemia. In addition, low levels of circulating insulin produce abnormal liver enzymes that reduce glucose absorption into the bloodstream. When these conditions occur together, they may lead to severe hypoglycemic episodes (hypoglycemia), a sudden drop in blood glucose level resulting in shock, coma and death.

What Causes Insulin Deficiency Symptoms?

The main causes of insulin deficiency symptoms include obesity, poor glycemic control, malnutrition, and genetics. Obesity has been shown to contribute to insulin resistance. Low energy intake combined with increased food consumption are known risk factors contributing to insulin resistance. Other possible factors include genetic predisposition, diet (especially refined carbohydrates) and lifestyle issues.

How Can I Prevent or Treat Insulin Deficiency Symptoms?

A diet rich in complex carbohydrate foods may help prevent or treat insulin resistance, particularly if it includes added fiber. A balanced diet containing adequate protein and healthy fats can aid in weight loss and improved metabolic profile. Patients who suffer from hypoglycemia due to lack of insulin often experience other problems including muscle weakness and sleep disturbance. These patients need assistance",63,Will multiple sclerosis affect my career?,-7.184300899505615,152,multimedqa,10,0.608,385,1
gpt2-large_59,"I have been asked this question by a number of users, and I am going to try to answer it in the most complete way possible. My view is that many people who believe they have MS will not get diagnosed with MS until they reach middle age. Many women with MS who think they may be at risk for getting MS also do not develop MS because they do not know or fear that their symptoms could indicate the development of MS. So I am not trying to say you can't develop MS if you don't live to adulthood (or even as late as 25). In fact, just the opposite is true - studies show that MS patients who live past 75 and never had symptoms before do sometimes experience early signs of MS. However, when those patients receive appropriate treatment, such as steroids or corticosteroids, the disease becomes less severe and more manageable. The same is true for some men with MS who did not develop any MS symptoms previously; however, the onset of clinical manifestations of the disease often occurs too late to prevent them from getting proper diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring.\nQuestion: should a person with MS ask her doctor for help?\nComplete Answer: Most doctors are good enough on their own, so there's no reason why you couldn't contact your primary care provider for information, advice, or support. If someone else does it better than you, great! But there's always a chance that he or she will make a mistake or misunderstand something. For example, maybe you'll be told that you need a doctor visit to determine if an MRI scan was done correctly. Or perhaps, the doctor has trouble understanding how you might feel. Again, talk to your doctor first and see what sort of things he or she might be able to help you with. \nQuestion: When searching online for information, is there a section devoted to people with MS?\nAnswer: Yes, there is. Here are two of my favorites. First is the article ""Where Can I Find Information About People Who Have Multiple Sclerosis?"" which includes resources for people with MS. Second is the one titled ""Who Has More Potential for Getting MS?"". It explains where you should look to find out whether someone has had recent symptoms, what they've seen, and what's been doing since, to help identify risk factors and potential treatments for MS. There is even a detailed list of possible types of multiple sclerosis, including rheumatoid, scleroderma, fibromyalgia, lupus, psoriatic arthritis, and thyroid",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-10.32839012145996,74,multimedqa,10,0.3627450980392157,422,2
gpt2-large_54,"Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nerves. Symptoms may not always be apparent on an exam. Some symptoms are progressive and irreversible, while others are temporary or treatable with medication. Treatment options vary among different types of MS, as do the risks associated with each approach. If you have questions about your own condition, please see your doctor immediately. \r

In general, MS appears after age 65 years, but symptoms typically appear earlier. The disease is generally self-limited in severity and usually resolves without treatment. While people with MS often experience significant loss of motor function, other conditions can impair their ability to work normally or perform daily activities. To prevent relapse or improve symptoms, follow these steps: \r

First, make sure your neurologist knows which type of MS you have. Most people who live with MS will eventually need surgery for removal of the diseased nerve cells and their surrounding tissues. You might also want to speak to your cardiologist, neurologist, psychiatrist, or nurse practitioner, if they don't already know. Your primary care physician might refer you to them for more information.\r

Next, find out what causes MS and how effective treatments work. As an example, consider how much time your body has left before your symptoms worsen. How long is too long? For example, someone with advanced multiple sclerosis may only require a few months of therapy before his symptoms become severe enough to warrant further intervention. A patient suffering from milder forms of the disease should receive no more than six months of treatment. Take this into consideration when choosing your treatment plan. The longer you wait to start treatment, the greater the risk that your treatment could fail because it's ineffective or the benefits are inadequate. Before starting any treatment, talk to your doctor about all possible alternatives. They can help guide you toward the best course of action. If you think you or someone else has MS, tell anyone who might need support to take a look at your health record at the National Center for Health Statistics in Bethesda, Maryland. There you'll find your current address and the name of your local MS clinic. Ask your doctor whether the person's condition qualifies you for assistance under the Medically Assisted Medicare Program (MedPAC). Many MS patients with chronic pain, anxiety, depression, fatigue, arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis benefit from using medications called ""active drugs."" These are prescribed by your doctor directly to relieve the pain and inflammation caused by chronic diseases such as MS. In",54,What does multiple sclerosis diagnosis include?

How do you keep yourself happy and healthy? By eating right and exercising regularly. You can improve your overall health with diet and exercise by following a healthy balance between fat intake, protein intake, carbohydrates intake, and fiber intake. For example, consuming only 15 grams of fiber per day is recommended for adults; this amount includes soluble vegetables such as broccoli, peas, carrots, cauliflower, and cabbage. Healthy fats should be limited to 30 percent of total calories while maintaining a normal blood cholesterol level (4,5). Additionally, eat an adequate amount of potassium, magnesium, calcium, and vitamin A to prevent hyperparathyroidism, which contributes to high levels of certain risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause neurological symptoms and can lead to death (6,7). Keepsake Picture: If you have a hard time sleeping, what might trigger it?

Answer: Look for a doctor's name on the prescription label or call the drug company's toll free number to verify that there is no generic drug available through that physician practice.


The most commonly used drugs by specialty pharmacies include all generic versions of over-the-counter (OTC) medications including analgesics, antipsychotics, antihistamines, birth control pills, diabetes medication, cholesterol lowering agents, flu medicines and others. This means that some of these drugs may not need an out-of-network pharmacy (in addition to the regular provider). Additionally, if you choose to receive prescriptions from one of these pharmacies, you should check with your local primary care physicians to ensure that they accept your insurance coverage. Please note that only specialty pharmacists who hold an MD degree can prescribe this type of drugs.

Answer: Yes, the FDA requires that anyone wanting to purchase a prescription drug must first establish that the drug is safe and effective for his or her intended use by evaluating the effectiveness of the patient. There are two requirements for obtaining a special authorization: 1) you must have a valid prescription from your primary care provider; 2) you must meet certain eligibility criteria which can be found here: http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/FoodandDrugAdministrationRegulations/ucm163556.htm \nQuestion: Is there any way that I can get specific directions on where to go for more information about my particular disease?

gpt2-large_114,"The DSM-5 describes BPD as follows: \1\BPD is characterized by intense and recurrent mood swings characterized by emotional outbursts that may be intense or distressing, sometimes lasting for an extended period of time;

\2\The primary feature of BPD is an obsession with being different from others (whether perceived or real) and in control of one's life. Patients report feelings of worthlessness, guilt, emptiness, lack of purpose or pleasure, and severe distress when they experience significant changes in themselves or those around them;

\3\Although many individuals with BPD become suicidal, the risk appears lower than in people without BPD because BPD patients do not feel so trapped within their own delusions;

\4\The most severe form of BPD includes episodes of severe self-injury and often times involves acts of aggression against other people. It also involves a high level of impulsivity and hyperactivity that can lead to substance abuse problems. \5\Many clinicians agree that treatment with medication seems to improve outcomes for some patients but has little effect on most. What are the signs and symptoms of borderline personality disorder? \6\Symptoms of borderline personality disorder include: \7\Irritability or rage when angry;

\8\A need to have others' approval;

\9\Intense jealousy or anger when others seem to be successful or attractive;

\10\Extremely insecure and self-centered behavior;

\11\Difficulty sleeping at night or needing frequent reminders that you are important;

\12\Feeling constantly under attack;

\13\Obsessive thoughts about other people or things. How is BPD diagnosed? Diagnosis of BPD is based on clinical observations, interviews, family history, psychiatric evaluation, and/or physical examination. In order to assess for severity of symptoms, it is necessary to take into account their frequency, duration, intensity, and impact. For example, if a patient reports that he or she regularly experiences an episode of intense anger or extreme self-consciousness, it is likely that this would be considered borderline personality disorder. If the individual feels constantly under attack, it could indicate that the person does not enjoy his or her life and is unable to function well because of this condition. On the other hand, if the patient does not report any instances of self-harm, it could indicate that the individual suffers from chronic depression or anxiety disorders and therefore needs care.

gpt2-large_85,"There is no cure for MS, but there are several ways to help improve your chances of regaining control over your symptoms. In addition, you can take steps to prevent or slow the progression of this disease by avoiding tobacco use, exercise, eating right, staying healthy, and being careful with drugs. If all else fails, talk with your doctor. What follows is an excerpt from Dr. Robert Spitzer's book, ""A New Approach to Remission."" It is reprinted here as an educational resource. The first question that should be asked when talking to people who have MS is whether they smoke. Some people do not want to know anything more than that because it does make them uncomfortable. But if you ask, ""Is smoking in your family?"" most people will say yes. That may also be true of those who have been diagnosed with MS. You might even find that some of these smokers have had some of their MS symptoms since childhood. Ask why they continue to smoke, especially if they are taking medications for the illness. Most people think that having MS was caused by some environmental factor, such as exposure to asbestos or chemicals in air pollution. However, many others believe that MS is caused by defective nerve cells, and/or by genetic causes. This belief is based on studies suggesting that a small percentage of the population has unusually low levels of certain enzymes (such as the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase), which are involved in forming serotonin, which plays an important role in controlling the immune system. Studies have shown that trying to correct such abnormal levels of enzyme activity could effectively inhibit healing in the body.\nQuestion: Can I treat my symptoms with herbal remedies? Complete Answer: While some herbal remedies contain ingredients that may relieve symptoms, other herbs are used for the purpose of stimulating the immune system so that it can fight infection. Other herbs may have additional uses such as treating skin conditions and reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes. In general, there is little evidence to support using any one herb for treatment of MS. However, if someone wants to consider alternative approaches to treatment, it is usually best to discuss it with his or her doctor before making any decisions. For example, taking aspirin regularly could increase the likelihood of cardiovascular problems, while some research suggests that drinking two glasses of water per day improves blood circulation. Similarly, consuming foods rich in vitamin C, such as broccoli, spinach, and grapes, may reduce the risk of developing various forms of cancer.

gpt2-large_123,"The best way to test for thyrotoxicosis is with an objective blood count (CBC). A normal number of thyroid hormones in your bloodstream is defined as one below the upper limit of detection. Thyrotoxicosis occurs when your body has too few or no circulating thyroxine levels due to either an inadequate amount of thyroxine in your diet (i.e., too little iodine) or excessive intake of food containing high amounts of thyroxines (such as soybeans). It can also occur if you have an autoimmune disorder such as Hashimoto's disease that results in overproduction of thyroid hormone. In this case, thyrotoxicity is caused by an antibody reaction against thyroxine, not by a genetic defect or deficiency of thyroid hormone itself. Your doctor may order a biopsy of your thyroid gland to rule out these possibilities. The most commonly used way of testing your thyroid level is with a urine sample taken within 24 hours after eating or drinking something containing significant quantities of dietary thyroxine. This test provides an accurate reading of how much thyroid hormone your body needs to maintain your normal functioning. You will need to eat at least 600 milligrams of thyroxine (approximately one eighth teaspoonful of pure protein) every two hours until your urine starts showing evidence of being full of thyroid hormone. For example, 1/2 cup of broccoli contains around 500 mg of thyroxine. If you take the same amount of broccoli today and then consume it tomorrow morning, there would be a positive result on a routine urinalysis. Please note that a negative result might indicate other conditions such as diabetes mellitus, low magnesium, or a variety of other problems unrelated to thyrotoxicosis. If you suspect that you may have hypothyroidism but have been told there is nothing wrong with you, consult with your doctor before starting any treatment regimen. Questions?

It's important for these patients to take their meds the day after taking them. These medications can lead to side effects such as increased blood pressure, heart problems, or seizures. These drugs may not be appropriate for all children, especially those who have other conditions that make them more likely to experience serious reactions from these medications. Some adults also need to avoid these medications.

Drugs used by adults with ADHD include methylphenidate (Ritalin), amphetamine (Adderall), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), and the antihistamine haloperidol (Haldol). There is no scientific evidence that any of these medications can treat adult ADHD; they simply act as stimulants to help improve behavior in younger children. It's recommended that you ask your doctor about using other medications if you're not sure if your child has an untreated ADHD. For more information on treating adult ADHD, visit our website at http://www.childmind.org/ADHD/.

What should I tell my kids before I start treatment?

Children with ADHD do best when treated early in life and during childhood. Children who will not respond to prescription medications due to side effects are usually too young to undergo psychiatric evaluation or even to seek therapy. You could risk losing the attention and support of your children who might otherwise benefit from treatment. So it's critical that you discuss treatment options with your family members and ask what services you can provide. Your pediatrician may suggest that you refer your child to a therapist, psychiatrist, social worker, or school counselor. Even though some research indicates that parents don't receive enough information about treatments available, many families find it convenient to talk openly about any concerns or questions. As long as your child has been diagnosed, you won't want to discourage him or her from seeking treatment.

When can I expect my child to begin treatment?

There are two main stages in the development of ADHD - preadolescent and adolescence. During the initial phase of development, children develop motor skills, language skills, fine motor skills, and problem solving abilities. Once this stage of development ends, children become hyperactive, irritable, and disruptive. In fact, one out of three children who have ADHD develops behavioral disorders over a lifetime.

It won't actually beat until several minutes later.\nQuestion 2: What kind of oxygen is in my body? Answer: Oxygen comes from your lungs. The main types of oxygen used by your body are O2 and O3. There's also a small amount of nitrogen (N2), but that's very rare in the environment. In fact, when your lungs fill with oxygen, they stop releasing carbon dioxide. All other oxygen your body uses is O2. As your oxygen level drops below 30% of your respiratory rate, the kidneys begin to produce enough water to keep you alive. If you have an issue like asthma or COPD, you may need to increase the oxygen content of your diet.\r

References \/ \/ \/ \/ Q1: Do animals have lungs? Answer: Animals don't have lungs because their bodies just don't have the capacity. When an animal breathes air, the lungs compress as well as any other part of its body; however, they're not capable of moving blood around. Therefore, if you breathe from the lungs, you don't get full use of all the oxygen available from the air. Instead, you get only about half of what you'd otherwise get. And since there aren't many organs (including the heart) that can expand enough to allow oxygen to flow easily through them, the tissues inside the lungs simply can't absorb all the oxygen.\r

If you buy from an authorized retailer, they will usually have a list of acceptable lenses on their website. Ask the person how much money is involved in getting a pair of glasses, how often they recommend purchasing a particular model, etc.\n\nQuestion: I am pregnant. How do I find out which size my baby is? Complete Answer: Some providers suggest taking your child's weight in ounces when looking at their birth certificate to get an accurate estimate of what size they might be. However, not every provider recommends this practice. It can cause some confusion among parents who want to know where their babies fit into the gender spectrum. You may need to ask your pediatrician before ordering birth-certificate sized glasses, however, as many healthcare professionals do not use birth certificates to calculate baby sizes.

In addition, a number of websites sell prescription sunglasses, even though many of these products contain chemicals known to harm vision. For instance, Acorn Vision sells ""Clear"" prescription shades sold under its own brand name. These products contain chemicals called UV filters that block harmful ultraviolet rays produced by sunlight. They also contain substances known to damage retinal cells, leading to decreased color sensitivity in people with certain types of eye diseases. This means that prescription sunglasses made from these materials could potentially affect sight, especially those whose eyesight has been affected by retinitis pigmentosa (RP).

What happens when you lose sleep?

If you're not getting enough sleep, there's an excellent chance you'll fall behind on work or school responsibilities. Or, if you have trouble sleeping at night, it may be that you're too tired to keep track of all your tasks during the day. You might find yourself having to juggle multiple jobs, multiple obligations, or even just one. If these things aren't possible when you're sleepy, try to get adequate rest every single day.

How do I get adequate sleep?

Here are some tips that will help ensure you get enough sleep throughout the day:

Get up at the same time every morning.

Set a bedtime alarm.

Don't smoke.

Eat breakfast before going to bed.

Use the bathroom during the daytime.

Sleep in a cool area with a fan running.

Do something relaxing after dinner.

Try other ways to get sufficient sleep.

Make sure you take a good nap each night.

A few additional considerations:

Stay away from alcohol and caffeine. These substances make you feel drowsy and tend to dehydrate you.

Avoid overindulging. If you start feeling sleepy right around 8pm, consider taking a short break and letting your body recover completely.

Consider eating healthy foods and exercising. In addition to improving your overall wellbeing, exercise helps relieve stress, decrease appetite, and reduce fatigue.

Remember to use the right pillow. A regular night mattress can provide a stable base for your head and neck. It doesn't matter which type of mattress you choose -- most will do. However, a firm foam mattress should always be preferred. Soft pillows won't allow proper air circulation, making you less likely to fall asleep fast.

When you first get food into your mouth the taste is usually unpleasant, but after two minutes or so everything tastes good and you want to eat all at once. You then need time to digest the food before you can feel full. After four hours you start to feel hungry again. At night when the hunger pangs go away you will start eating again. You may eat for three days straight without feeling like eating. Some people think that you should not eat on Sunday, since the fasting period helps them to break their fast. But I recommend that you abstain from going out on the town during the day on Sundays. As soon as the week begins you will feel thirsty again. On Mondays you still need to drink water, but most people find it easier to drink soda instead of water. By keeping up with your diet you will see that after ten days you will have lost half of what you started with.

gpt2-large_68,"\nIn MS patients with active disease the brain does not produce enough cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to keep blood pressure stable at rest. The body needs more CSF from the lungs. This causes swelling in the brain and other symptoms of the disease. The amount of CSF available depends on how much CSF is circulating in the body. \nTotal blood volume \nIn an average adult: 8 ounces per minute. A woman's total blood volume is about 2 1/2 quarts. \nThe number of CSF cells that can be produced by each cubic millimeter of CSF varies widely between different people and diseases. The range for normal adults ranges from 50,000 to 100 million. The range for children ranges from 15,000 to 40 million. \nChildren also have different amounts of the proteins needed for proper functioning. Children need fewer proteins than adults. For example, infants require only 4 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. Adults need more protein than children because their bodies don't make enough of it. In fact, children typically need less protein than adults because their muscles do most of the work. When a child has an illness, her immune system releases antibodies designed to destroy tumors but often they don't respond well to vaccines or drugs that could help them fight cancer. Some children who get cancer develop severe side effects, like brain inflammation, seizures, paralysis, heart problems, or death. If you have questions about your child's immunization status, call your pediatrician at 612-624-4847. \nWhat is thimerosal?

\nThimerosal was removed from many childhood vaccines starting in 1999. Thimerosal has been linked to autism and neurological damage in fetuses and young children. It is used as an additive to prevent bacterial growth and in some medications. It can enter through food and drink. It may cause harm when swallowed, absorbed through the skin, or injected into tissues where it interacts with substances such as hormones and enzymes. Although there were no reports of adverse events after childhood vaccines containing thimerosal, CDC recommends that parents discuss this option with their doctor before vaccinating their children. \nIs it safe to give vaccines to my child?

gpt2-large_57,"This is a good question because the answer depends on several factors such as when you first became ill, what stage of MS you have now, how long it has been since you got sick, what other medical conditions your family may also be suffering from or if you yourself are prone to MS symptoms. If someone has no memory loss (as in an Alzheimer's patient) then your doctor will know that you have the disease before you developed this condition, but they won't necessarily tell you that you've had more than one attack, for example. They'll just say it happened at some point after age 20.\nQuestion: Why is my blood sugar so high? Complete Answer: Your body uses glucose as fuel for energy. The higher your blood sugar level, the less likely you are to eat enough food to maintain healthy weight. People with diabetes who try to control their blood sugar with medications usually end up gaining weight while losing muscle mass and bone density. When blood sugars rise above 140 mg/dl then people need to take insulin injections or be put on a diet. Some people get used to having very low levels of blood sugar (less than 100 mg/dl) during times of illness; others don't even notice it happens until something bad happens and they're out of insulin shots or dieting.\nQuestion: How do I remove fat from my stomach? Complete Answer: One way is by eating a whole-food diet that includes lots of vegetables and fruits. Other methods include doing a ""slow"" workout program like yoga or running or taking a probiotic supplement. It's not the only option, however, because many different foods can affect how much fat you lose through digestion or absorption. You should watch which foods give you the best results and consult a specialist to determine which ones might help you most. For more information on reducing fat intake see the sidebar titled ""Understanding Fat Loss"".\nQuestion: What happens to the hormones in my body after I die? Complete Answer: There is currently little research on this topic, although there is increasing evidence that our body will release certain hormone secretions into the air we breathe after we die. These substances are known as metabolites. However, these compounds are difficult to detect and are rarely measured in humans. The main thing you must keep in mind is that when death occurs you will still be living. So even though your heart stops beating for a few minutes, your brain doesn't stop functioning.

\nAnswer 2. When should MS begin?

\nAnswer 3. How does MS progress?

\nAnswer 4. Does my family have any history of MS?

\nQuestion: My daughter has been diagnosed with primary progressive multiple sclerosis. How do I make sure she doesn't get another one?

\nAnswer: \nIn the United States, there are two main types of MS, which are also known as ""primary"" or primary progressive MS. In primary progressive MS, symptoms usually start at age 45 and continue for the rest of your life. It can be either partial or total (or both). The disease often progresses without treatment, but in some cases, medications such as cyclosporine or rituximab may help slow progression. Your child will likely receive a diagnosis of MS even if he or she never had a previous form of MS. This might lead you to wonder whether or not to treat your child's condition. However, when deciding what to do with a child who develops symptoms during childhood, it is important to know that children can develop this type of MS at any time in their lives. If your child experiences these signs and symptoms throughout his or her lifetime, then treating the onset of the symptoms could trigger future MS. A positive test for active MS may mean the illness is not an early onset, but many children with MS later develop the full spectrum of symptoms. For example, they may lose motor control and speech, and they may need physical therapy or other forms of support to help them return to activities like reading, walking, or going out to play. Even though treatment may prevent the development of new MS symptoms in the future, even after treatment stops, many children with MS will still experience problems later on in their lives, so it's possible they won't ever be able to fully recover from the illness.

SUMMARY:

MS is a chronic neurological disorder that affects people ages 5 through",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-0.4505232572555542,47,multimedqa,10,0.3533834586466165,386,7
gpt2-large_93,"Yes. The exact cause of MS is unknown. However, the disease can be caused by inflammation of the brain or spinal cord as well as other diseases such as arthritis or cancer that cause abnormal immune systems. People with MS may sleep less than usual, especially during times when they're at home. Sleep disorders can also lead to memory loss and concentration difficulties. Some patients who suffer from sleep issues report feeling more tired before their illness develops.

Question: I have several chronic health conditions including diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, and asthma. My doctor says it's time to get my blood work checked. What should I do? Complete Answer: A blood test will help you understand your own body so you can make appropriate treatment decisions. Your doctor will look for changes in certain areas of your body. You'll need an accurate reading of your red blood cells (RBC) count. This measure helps doctors determine whether you're at risk of developing a serious problem called ""migraine"" that causes intense pain, dizziness, and weakness. It also lets them figure out if you've had an infection or allergy. If you've been diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder (such as lupus), it could affect your blood tests. Your doctor might suggest taking steroids to lower levels of certain proteins found in your bloodstream. They can reduce the symptoms of an autoimmune disorder and potentially lower your chances of having another one. You might also want to consider medications to relieve symptoms associated with some conditions.",93,Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?,-0.1010131388902664,3,multimedqa,10,0.015151515151515152,252,11

gpt2-large_116,"A. The majority of prostate cancers are not aggressive and do not require surgery or radiation therapy. If your doctor has already referred you for surgery (such as biopsy) or radiation treatment in the past two years, it is very likely that he will also recommend surgery, or have already recommended radiation therapy. Surgery is often recommended for men with early stage cancer. \nQuestion: recurrence prostate cancer\nComplete Answer:

A. Most men who get new prostate cancer never develop a recurrance. However, if your doctor has diagnosed something other than an adenoma on imaging after a previous procedure, such as radiotherapy or radiation therapy, then it is possible that the diagnosis could be incorrect (false positive) and that you will develop a recurrence. In this case, you should consider getting an MRI scan, or a colonoscopy, before going under general anesthesia and obtaining additional information from your healthcare provider. In addition, some doctors will offer you medication that may help prevent recurrence, however, these drugs may have side effects that can vary depending on the patient's age, weight, tobacco use, and any diseases they are taking. Therefore, it is important to talk to your physician about whether your health insurance covers any such medications and whether they would be prescribed by your healthcare provider. It is also critical that you discuss any potential risks associated with your current medication regimen with your healthcare provider. \nQuestion: recurrence of prostate cancer\nComplete Answer:

A. Many men will experience recurrence of their prostate cancer, usually without surgery. This generally happens within five years after the initial diagnosis. Some of this recurrence may be benign and progress slowly; others may actually spread into the surrounding tissues. Also, some patients who have had a first-line course of radiation therapy will go through more aggressive treatment with radiation and/or chemotherapy. While a specific date of the recurrence is unknown, most recursions occur soon after radiation therapy. In many cases, there is little point in waiting longer because the recurrence may not be related to radiation therapy. There are several reasons why recurrence occurs even when radiation therapy is well tolerated. For example, patients may receive additional doses of radiation during subsequent treatments because the dosage was too high (too many additional cycles), the time needed to reach peak response (the number of tumors responding to radiation), and/or a combination of the factors above. Even though most recurrences are benign, the risk of recurrence may increase with increasing doses and duration of",116,outcome prostate cancer,-10.130212783813477,127,multimedqa,10,0.5120967741935484,413,6

gpt2-large_130,"This is an extremely important question that could have serious consequences for your life or the lives of other people. The short answer is that there is no scientific evidence whatsoever suggesting any particular kind of stretch should be done by anyone in order to reduce your risk of cancer or heart disease. There is certainly some research into stretching muscles, but it doesn't seem all that strong. I'm not going to give you the science behind what works and what doesn't, because most of it is quite well known already (see above). But here are my own personal experience with stretching, and how much I believe that it does or does not help.

First off, let's start with what makes stretching different from anything else you can do to increase your flexibility. When your body stretches, each muscle group performs slightly differently as they adapt to the new tension. This means that if someone were to go through a typical stretching routine, their muscles would probably be able to take on a lot more stress than usual and still maintain that flexibility. To put things another way, a person who does a traditional stretch every day will likely be at full strength within a week of doing this. This is something that you don't want when you're trying to get lean and keep your joints healthy, so you need to know exactly which muscles you are supposed to stretch before beginning a set of exercises.

For example, let's say that we are going to stretch our shoulders. First thing you'll notice is that your shoulders will feel a little tight and that it might hurt a bit to do a regular stretch. However, since the muscles are adapting to the new tension and you aren't trying to ""tear them apart,"" they won't actually become sore and uncomfortable immediately after doing these exercises. In fact, if you follow the basic plan suggested below, you'd probably end up feeling even stronger and more flexible than if you hadn't stretched your shoulders at all! And remember, when it comes to stretching, you really shouldn't try to change your body type or size just to improve your flexibility. You should always think about getting fit and active instead. A lot of people like to try to do lots of exercise and burn fat while being flexible, yet when you compare how strong they feel compared to someone without a ton of fitness background, you realize that this isn't usually worth the extra effort. So when you're ready to make a commitment to learn proper stretching technique, read on…

Answer Question: What are the risk factors for myopic eye disease? Complete Answer: There are a number of risk factors that may increase your chance of developing ocular glaucoma; such as smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, and an unhealthy diet. In addition, many people who develop glaucoma have genetic problems that can predispose them to it. For example, if you inherit two copies of a defective gene called RASF4, which produces abnormal retinal pigment epithelial growth factor (RPE), your chances of developing glaucoma rise significantly. If you also have high levels of another vitamin K-dependent protein called ubiquinone, you are at greater risk for developing glaucoma because of its ability to inhibit RPE production. People with some inherited risk factors may not be able to produce enough RPE to prevent their eyes from becoming infected by Glaucoma bacteria. And even those individuals whose genetics make them susceptible may still be able to get glaucoma without any signs of infection.

Question: How do I decide whether to treat my chronic migraine headaches with medication? Complete Answer: You must first evaluate your condition before considering medication. Treatment with medications does not provide full relief from symptoms so you should start looking at other options after you determine that you have persistent headaches that persist despite treatment. Many medicines work well when used properly and safely for a limited amount of time. Others cause side effects or adverse reactions that require stopping therapy early. Sometimes they don't work at all when prescribed. Your doctor will discuss possible alternatives with you when you see him or her. Ask your doctor for advice on how long to wait between taking drugs and treatments, what doses to take, how often to use the pills, and whether to continue using them. Your doctor may suggest medications that are considered safe but not always effective.

Studies show that couples who both have hypothyroidism usually have different levels of reproductive function. Some research shows that a woman whose ovaries produce less than 5 milligrams of thyroid per day has reduced sexual desire.

Why does someone need to be in treatment? Treatment for mental illness is not only important for the person receiving treatment but also for society at large. Research shows that treating people who experience mental illnesses can improve the quality of life of others as well as promote social support and reduce stigma associated with mental illnesses. In addition, there is evidence showing that mental illnesses can affect people's relationships and work performance. These effects may last long after the patient leaves treatment. For example, while treatment may relieve some symptoms of anxiety, many of these symptoms return when patients return home or if they become involved in other activities.

There is currently no cure for this disease, but research has revealed a number of promising treatments that have shown promise in clinical trials.\nQuestion: What is a Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT)?

Answer: A GTT is an oral test administered by your healthcare provider to determine whether you are diabetic or not. You must pass a GTT if your blood sugar level is high enough to cause discomfort. The most commonly used tests include the OGTT or the HbA1c. In some cases, there may also be other tests performed with the same results. The purpose of these tests is to help ensure the patient doesn't become dependent upon medication or diet changes to treat their diabetes. Many patients who fail these tests will still benefit from having the patient's blood sugars checked regularly as it will allow doctors to monitor their progress over time.

gpt2-large_119,"The safest way to sleep is on your back, not any other position. If you have a good night's rest and you can make it to bed without falling asleep on the couch or at the side of the sofa, then you should take that as your new sleeping position. However, if you feel uncomfortable lying down on your back, it may be time for an adjustment to more comfortable positions that will allow you to get a better night's sleep.


There are many different reasons for which people tend to fall asleep while standing up from their beds, so we would like to answer some questions that may help you find what position works best for you.


Sitting or laying down when asleep may lead to problems with your body because there is less blood circulation through the limbs, causing numbness and tingling in these areas. Also, the amount of pressure placed upon the head and neck by gravity during the sitting stage decreases, and this reduces the sensation of pressure around the eyes, nose, and mouth, making them difficult to breathe normally when awake. This leads to breathing difficulties in the morning.


Also, because the body has been accustomed to being upright all day long, the muscles in the lower extremities (especially the thighs) become fatigued and weak. As a result, the legs move backward or forward instead of upward (in an attempt to keep balance), increasing the chance of falls. This can also cause back problems, particularly if you have a history of back problems.


The reason why people sometimes fall asleep while lying down is because they are usually too tired to move well enough to avoid slipping out of bed. This can happen even if one is moving to the bathroom before waking up, or if one is eating breakfast while taking a nap; either of these actions can cause slippage into the prone position. A combination of exhaustion, reduced movement, and poor posture can prevent people from getting into a natural state of sleep. So, instead of trying to wake yourself up, try doing something else first.


If you do decide to lie down while sleeping, make sure to lay as flat as possible (not leaning backwards). You want to make sure that you are not laying upside down on the mattress, and you can use the same mattress as normal in order to avoid having one side of your mattress touch the floor.

gpt2-large_126,"The term \""antral\"" refers to the testicular structure that produces male hormones such as testosterone and estradiol (estrogen). The most commonly used method of contraception is chemical or surgical sterilization. Sterilization reduces sexual pleasure and can cause permanent infertility. Because hormonal contraceptives suppress the ovaries in women, they provide only partial protection against pregnancy, so some women may experience an adverse effect on their fertility if they use them for too long. This is not true with hormonal contraceptive methods; they generally protect against conception without causing an estrogenic reaction. \nQuestion: what does \""anti-androgens\"" mean? Complete Answer: Anti-androgens are substances that reduce or prevent production of certain types of hormone, including the growth and release of gonads, prostate glands, and other reproductive organs. Anti-androgens are also called sex steroids, and anti-estrogens are referred to by this term because they inhibit the formation of estrogens. In fact, some anti-androgens have been found to be more effective at reducing the effects of female hormones than estrogen replacement therapy. For example, some anti-androgens like norgestimate are thought to be more effective at preventing the onset of menses than oral contraceptives. Some anti-androgens are considered safe even when taken repeatedly over time. In addition, many of the chemicals that contain these compounds, such as acrylamide and ethinyl estradiol, are excreted in urine. \nQuestion: how do I know if I am taking an injectable drug or an implant? Complete Answer: When you read this question, you must be asking yourself: ""What's this all about?"" A number of questions asked during a routine visit will reveal whether you are receiving medication or an implant. These include: \nquestion: Are my symptoms coming back? Complete Answer: Your doctor will want to determine how much treatment you need before treating your disease further. If you receive any type of medication, ask your doctor if you should continue to take it.

3. My child's asthma is getting worse. What should I do?

Your doctor will evaluate whether asthma may be causing your child's symptoms. If your child does not respond to treatment, you might try using different medications or giving your child special dietary supplements. See your doctor for more information about this topic.

4. How common is severe allergic rhinitis (anaphylaxis)?

The exact number varies by age. The National Institutes of Health estimates that up to 3 percent of children ages 1–6 years have severe allergic rhinitis.[1]

5. Do all children get bronchial asthma?

All kids who receive oxygen therapy experience some sort of adverse reaction. Most often these reactions are mild—for instance, sneezing or shortness of breath. But sometimes they are life-threatening, such as chest tightness or trouble breathing. Sometimes serious complications occur; for example, heart attack or stroke, coma, or death. These types of adverse reactions usually affect only one person in 10,000 people.

Some kinds of severe allergic reactions require hospitalization. Serious cases can result in death.

It is important to keep allergic conditions under close observation. Talk with your pediatrician if you think your child has had any type of problem, including an allergic reaction, since he or she was younger than 2 years old.

In general, most kids who experience any kind of allergic event from inhaling things like pollen, dander, dust mites, mold, peanuts, and tree nuts don't need emergency care. However, you may wish to talk with your child's allergist about the best course of action for him or her. Your child's allergist may recommend that your child undergo an allergy test or that your child avoid certain foods, especially during times when there are seasonal allergies.",112,symptoms of asthma,-7.873619079589844,104,q,1,0.49523809523809526,333,13

PNS (pancreatic insufficiency)

Symptoms: Diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, bloating, and fatigue.


Treatment: DNP is a diuretic with limited effect on pancreatic enzymes; the only treatment for POTS is a low-sodium diet to reduce potassium levels, which are an important source of water in this disorder. The aim is to lower these levels by replacing them with ketones or fat from food or supplements.

The effects of dosing on blood sugar levels are not well established. It has been suggested that long term exposure might lead to hyperglycemia[10]. However, it seems unlikely that low doses of DNP will cause hypoglycemic symptoms if used properly. A study using 6 mg/day gave no adverse side effects; the dose given was much higher than usual, but there were no serious complications reported. In addition, the drug was administered as intravenous injections, which may have increased the risk of bleeding and infection.

For those without significant liver disease or diabetes, DNP should be considered as part of a weight loss programme.[11] For people with liver problems, it may be recommended to use insulin for control.[12]

Dietary restrictions (including restricting carbohydrate intake) should be implemented when prescribed dosing. Low carb diets tend to raise serum glucose levels significantly[13][14], so caution must be taken.

In patients with kidney disorders, such as dialysis, a high protein diet may be needed for optimal health. This depends upon individual circumstances.

Nausea and vomiting [ edit ]

This is very common in POTS and can be seen on some symptom checklists. Symptoms include abdominal cramping, abdominal distention, and nausea. If you suspect this condition, consult your doctor.

POTS (polycystic ovaries), also known as polycystic ovaries syndrome, is a complex disease. There are at least two types of POTS:[15]

gpt2-large_1,"Chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease and stroke affect millions of people in India. They are major causes of disability and death among persons over 65 years of age. The burden from these diseases is severe and increasing rapidly due to health-care costs and other social and economic costs. In contrast, acute diseases like infectious and parasitic diseases are treated by specialists who often treat a limited number of patients at one time. These disorders pose more immediate risks to individuals but also may be preventable through good prevention practices that include active hygiene, nutrition and exercise. For instance, people living in areas with high pollution should reduce exposure to indoor air pollutants, use air purifiers or filters when cooking, eating, and bathing, and limit the amount of alcohol they consume. The WHO has estimated that an additional 2 billion cases of noncommunicable conditions will occur worldwide this century (Table 1). There are many reasons why these diseases develop in developed countries. First, some of them arise out of lifestyle choices related to smoking, drinking, obesity, poor diet and lack of physical activity; second, certain genetic factors predispose some populations to developing such diseases, including those who already have such diseases. Third, some pathogens cause infection through direct contact, such as by kissing or using contaminated objects, which can easily spread infectious agents across communities. And fourth, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and others carry HIV in the blood, and HIV is closely associated with chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, sleep apnea and Alzheimer's dementia.

Your symptoms should gradually improve within a few months of beginning therapy, although it can take longer for some patients because they have to stay on medication.

How often do I need to take MS medications?

MS medicines should never be taken at any time without consulting your healthcare provider (an MS specialist). Most people who are prescribed these medicines understand how to use them correctly and follow all directions. For example, a person with multiple sclerosis who takes a pill every day may not experience side effects, such as dizziness or low blood pressure, that are common in the same situation if she took an oral drug called Prozac instead. There is no evidence to suggest that taking two or three different MS drugs at once decreases the effectiveness of the other medicines. If you're taking two or three pills each day, talk to your doctor about whether you should continue to take one or both at regular intervals over several weeks. Talk with your doctor before starting treatment for people who have had previous episodes of MS. Even though the disease has progressed, there's still risk associated with treatment, including developing new infections, which could spread to other parts of the body. People with multiple sclerosis should also consider making sure their health care team is familiar with the treatment options available. If a patient does not want to wait until the disease is well-controlled, the most effective treatment option may involve a combination of drugs used together. For people with MS, this means combining a specific type of drug with another medicine. This is typically when someone takes an FDA-approved medicine together with another drug – either a medication or an antibiotic – which is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and manufactured under the brand name ""titrazole."" See How Multiple Sclerosis Treatments Work and Ask Your Doctor for More Information. What is the difference between a drug and antibiotic? A drug is an active substance that changes the way your body works. Antibiotics are antibiotics that change bacteria in the body so they don't reproduce themselves. These drugs are sometimes given separately and sometimes combined. Sometimes it doesn't matter what combination of drugs are being used; however, there is no indication for using the same combination twice. Examples of different types of drug include: antihistamines — such as Benadryl and Aleve

Pregnancy can be very stressful for any woman but especially so if you're a mother with disabilities or medical issues. These can result in more complex pregnancies that include labor pains, delivery complications or even death. Some of the more common problems we see include:

Pre-term labor

Premature birth (before 37 weeks)

Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)

Miscarriage

Excessive bleeding/indigestion

Irregular vaginal bleeding during pregnancy

Cerebral palsy (a condition where your brain is out of position and has trouble controlling your muscles)

Postpartum depression

Injuries to the fetus or newborn

It's important to note that many women do not have these complications, although they should always receive support from their healthcare providers. There are also other ways that a pregnant woman may experience stress as well including:

Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa

Drug use (including prescription medication and over-the-counter products like aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and others)

Sleep disturbances

Painful childbirth

Lack of sleep

Being unable to carry a child due to physical limitations

What about using it for depression?

This is a more controversial question than you might think. One study found that low doses of rosuvastatin were beneficial for people with major depressive disorder. But there are some caveats here. Many studies suggest that antidepressants don't work as well as they used to, and one study found that half of people who received both an antidepressant and anti-depressant medication did not experience improvement after six months. Another study found that higher dosages of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, may be useful for treating depression but only if the drugs are taken with food. More research needs to be done to establish whether these drugs are effective for depressed patients who don't respond to other therapies.

Many clinicians believe that low levels of cholesterol also make people healthier. They argue that high blood cholesterol is associated with increased risks of heart attacks and stroke, and lower levels of LDL (""bad"") cholesterol are linked to fewer deaths from heart disease. Other researchers say that high levels of total cholesterol are associated with increased risk of diabetes mellitus. The evidence shows that lowering cholesterol isn't likely to cause problems; however, taking statins does seem to help prevent type 2 diabetes.

Which other treatments should I try first?

If your doctor doesn't prescribe drugs or surgery right away, ask him or her what others could be tried first. If your symptoms aren't improving within six weeks or so, contact your primary care provider for advice on starting other medications or procedures.

How do we keep people safe on the road?

The Road Safety Agency works closely with the police to make sure everyone travelling on UK roads is doing what they should. We use all reasonable means to detect illegal activity along the route including roadside checks, CCTV cameras, signs and markings. For example, road safety officers patrol roads frequently. If you've been stopped or questioned by a traffic officer, it would be helpful to tell us why you were being asked to move while you're still speaking to the officer. Please note that if an officer has reason to suspect that you're guilty of any offence, he or she may ask you to step aside until we investigate further. Police staff carry out random breath tests at stops, but there are no random spot checks. In addition, roadside patrols are part of routine operations across the country and regular enforcement actions are carried out throughout the year. Police officers will not stop someone simply because they think they look suspicious – this includes when using mobile phones or taking photos. The police are not authorised to search passengers or vehicles unless they have been requested to do so under section 44 of the Transport Act 1996. Motorists must always wear a seatbelt and give consent before entering private property (for example,",52,What are the most common mental health problems?

Hypothyroidism is a medical condition that affects the thyroid gland.

In some cases, it also helps regulate blood pressure and regulates your heart rate, as well as help regulate your brain activity. If you're diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease or any other autoimmune diseases, your doctor may suggest testing to check for abnormal levels of thyroid hormone (T3). This test will look at the size of your glands, your hair color, your nails, and the type of tissue in your stomach or intestines.

If treatment is not working, you could use medication to reduce symptoms or other techniques. The same approach applies if there's no other treatment option available. And, again, remember that any therapy will help some people with MS, but it may also cause side effects. Many medications have been shown in studies to cause significant adverse reactions and even death in patients who take them for long periods of time, so carefully consider whether the benefits outweigh the risks. Also, there are many medical conditions that can lead to serious problems with the immune system; therefore, there are a variety of vaccines available to protect against these diseases.

Q: Is there anything else I should know about my illness?\nA: When someone has MS, they often experience worsening of their health over time, especially as their body continues to lose its ability to regulate itself and fight infections. This is known as autoimmunity, an autoimmune disease that occurs when healthy cells attack and destroy the healthy ones around them. Autoimmune disorders such as MS can last years before starting to improve. So you might feel like everything just seems OK until one day everything changes completely -- or worse. It's important to keep up to date on what's happening and to get regular tests to see if your progress is slowing down. Remember to always stay out of bed if you've had pain or fever for more than four weeks. And remember that being in remission isn't permanent.

Q: does this mean I have to stop drinking alcohol?

A: No, it's not that simple. We advise people with diabetes to limit their intake of carbohydrates and beverages containing sugar. In particular, avoid foods high in fructose and added sugars such as honey or agave nectar. A study found that those with type 2 diabetes who reduced consumption of these types of sugar by at least one-third were able to maintain normal blood glucose levels after surgery (9).

How much weight can I lose if I'm overweight?

If you're overweight, how fast you shed pounds depends on several factors. Firstly, your body mass index (BMI) – which is calculated using height and weight – should be between 25 and 30. Secondly, you need to gain weight over time to achieve and maintain a healthy BMI. There are some guidelines that you can follow to help you reach your target weight. The American Diabetes Association recommends losing 5% to 10% of your initial bodyweight each year. However, experts recommend only reducing your total daily calorie intake by about 150 calories per day. This will also encourage more exercise as well as eating healthily. If you start your diet right away, you can probably lose up to 15% of your initial bodyweight.",22,my risk for developing type 2 diabetes,-7.793161869049072,162,q,1,0.648,241,9

Also it's not like we have a set number of months or years to wait for the 'normal' progression of the disease. Each person will react differently and each time they'll get better at different rates.

Q: how long should patients expect to live?

A: that depends on many factors including age, current health, genetic predisposition etc. It generally takes longer than you think. The average life span in adults with relapsing-remitting MS is 9-11 years. So if your symptoms aren't improving over this period then it would be wise to try and get them under control as soon as possible – ideally within 2 years.

gpt2-large_93,"Yes. Studies have shown that sleep disturbances are often a problem in MS patients, and this is consistent with other studies finding sleep disruption is also linked to neurodegeneration. As well as the memory impairment which may be seen in MS patients, there could also be cognitive impairments in those who experience difficulty concentrating or recalling information. For example, patients who report having difficulties with focus might find themselves unable to concentrate in the morning due to sleep deprivation. In addition, studies have found that sleep disruptions may increase the risk of developing dementia. This is particularly true for those with Alzheimer's disease, whose sleep needs become increasingly more demanding in later life.\r

\r

Sleep disorders can also affect mood and mood-related symptoms (e.g., depression). There has been some evidence to suggest that the incidence of depression in MS patients may increase when they don't get enough sleep.\r

\r

As with any mental health condition, MS affects many different groups of people – from sufferers to their families and carers. It should always be treated by one person with MS and their family members. When seeking advice about an illness you're experiencing, it's important to remember that everyone is unique! \r

\r

MS doesn't discriminate against anyone, so please speak to someone at your local MS support group if you feel unsure about what to say to a family member. Many people suffering from MS benefit greatly from talking to others with MS, and being able to discuss issues such as treatment options and managing sleep can help reduce stress and anxiety associated with the disease. \r

In fact, some studies have shown that it may be harmful if taken over long periods of time and by certain individuals. So, it should be used only under close supervision by an experienced health care provider. \r

See FAQs about the Covid-19 vaccine at http://www.vaccinesafety.org/medical-conditions/acute-paralysis/. [12] A study conducted in Italy suggested that there is a link between vaccination with the Hib vaccine (Hib) and cervical cancer as well as HIV infection.\nA: The HPV vaccine is effective against most strains of HPV and it protects against all types of cervical cancer, including precancerous cancers like premenopausal or postmenopausal. However, more research must be done on whether the HPV vaccine will protect against cancer caused by other types of HPV, which do exist within the human body. Although there are no data suggesting any increased risk of cervical cancer from HPV infections, it could increase the risk of developing some other diseases such as penile cancer and anal cancer, particularly for young men who take the HPV vaccine regularly. In addition, it has been suggested that women infected with a type of HPV known as 631(G), which may also cause genital warts, should consider getting vaccinated against it in order to reduce their chance of contracting this disease. To learn more about the risks associated with HPV, go to HPV and Cancer. [13] A review of 13 published epidemiological studies suggests that male circumcision reduces the risk of contracting herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2). It also prevents transmission of HPV and HSV-1. However, the reasons why circumcision can prevent HSV-2 transmission are unclear. Also, there are conflicting reports regarding whether the benefits of circumcision outweigh the potential harms of circumcision. For example, one study indicated that men circumcised as adults had lower rates of contracting HIV than uncircumcised males. This finding does not prove that circumcision causes reduced risk of HIV infection, but rather supports the theory that circumcision might slow the spread of a sexually transmitted infection or a group of viruses known as ""herpesviruses."" There is also a possible connection between the circumcision and the spread of chlamydia. Some researchers hypothesize that circumcision reduces the number of sex partners and thus increases susceptibility to transmitting STIs. However, others note that circumcised",72,Is the Covid-19 vaccine safe for people taking multiple sclerosis drugs?,-1.2276902198791504,68,q,1,0.3192488262910798,400,30

Hospitals will usually try to keep the disease from spreading by isolating families with MS and keeping them isolated for up to seven days at a time while they receive treatment. The Mayo Clinic recommends avoiding contact between relatives of patients who have the illness and their caregivers -- but does admit it might be possible to make arrangements so relatives are able to see each other without being closely monitored.

As the disease progresses, there's a risk of the immune system attacking some parts of the body more aggressively than others. Some people develop severe joint pain or stiffness that can spread to other areas of the body. In rare cases, MS causes paralysis of the lower limbs. There are no effective treatments for those conditions.

The CDC says most people with MS are cured within two years after diagnosis. For those who cannot tolerate standard treatment, many hospitals offer experimental drugs such as cyclosporine (see sidebar).",79,Can I pass multiple sclerosis to other family members?,-0.0193077679723501,0,q,1,0.0,202,9

Also, because it focuses on helping people develop healthy ways of thinking about themselves and the world, rather than treating specific illness or disorders, it tends to focus more on finding solutions to problems instead of just 'fixing' the problem at hand (which is usually unsuccessful). It's also much easier to get involved in - you don't have to find a counsellor who has an actual training in psychology or psychiatry or even a doctor in your area to refer you to a therapist. Q: What is psychodynamic psychotherapies like?\nA: These are therapies aimed at addressing deeper aspects of our inner lives. They're based on beliefs and attitudes held by our ancestors and family members from the past, which may not always reflect our current views. For instance, a person may believe that all pain is caused by bad karma (e.g., bad thoughts), but then decide that some of her own experiences and feelings were just part of life's ups and downs. Similarly, a person may feel very sad after a recent bereavement but think she feels great now, yet later say that she's still feeling down and depressed. In addition, a person may hold different values from those held by society and from his parents/teachers. That doesn't mean he'll necessarily become ""better"" if he goes through the same thing again, but will simply bring out new values of his own. The most effective way to deal with these issues is to come up with alternative perspectives. So, for example, if someone believes that all good things happen because of God, he might start working towards becoming a Christian priest, since it's believed to be something everyone should do. Another approach involves understanding the causes of our problems and trying to change them before they cause us harm or damage ourselves or others.

Briefly, the symptoms of IBS are similar to those described in children with gastrointestinal disorders. For example, the GI tract can become irritated (diarrhea) and swollen (fever). The stomach may not be able to hold food well because it is still full after eating, or the intestines may have difficulty digesting a meal. Irritation may also occur if the digestive system is disrupted by infection (such as from food poisoning). However, patients also experience these symptoms when there is no specific cause for their symptoms, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease. In some cases, they may have a specific medical condition that causes their symptoms, such as an autoimmune disorder.

For people who develop acute IBS during pregnancy or early childhood, some researchers believe that this may be a result of poor diet or inadequate nutrition in the mother's diet. Additionally, some pregnant women do not receive proper breastfeeding support. These factors may contribute to IBS development and worsen the outcome.

The diagnosis of IBS must be confirmed through physical examination, laboratory testing, or imaging studies. In addition, information on other health conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, or obesity) should be included to help the clinician determine whether it might be related to IBS.",108,chronic diarrhea short-term memory sweating inability to regulate body temperature heart palpitations dysautonomia,-6.23095703125,9,q,1,0.15254237288135594,203,5

That's a very important thing, especially in an old age when the body is already going through such a process of aging. It also helps to have some kind of lifestyle changes. When I was young, my father was always telling me about the importance of exercise and diet, so I've been doing that since then. And I still try to follow those instructions today. So there are many different ways to overcome this type of illness and maintain good health. Q: How did you become interested in cooking? A: My mother made me cook as soon as she got married, but because my father had taken over my kitchen duties, I didn't get much training until I graduated from high school. So one day I told her what I wanted to do with my life, and she decided to let me go into cooking. Since then I've tried a variety of recipes. After I started working as a waiter at a restaurant, people would ask me how I could possibly eat the food they served on their tables. Some people were able to tell that the foods I prepared weren't bad, while others said that they just couldn't believe that someone could be making them. In the end, after getting quite some experience, I realized that I don't actually need to have all sorts of different dishes, only to mix them together so that the overall taste matches well with the customer. Cooking has always been something I enjoy, so I figured I'd start making some money by selling something similar. Q: What type of company are you currently working for? A: I'm currently employed by a large department store chain in Tokyo called Gifu-shi. The job consists of serving customers' meals. Q: Why did you decide to work for this particular company? A: Because I'm really passionate about food, and I like cooking too. This may sound weird, but I am also looking forward to becoming a manager. Q: Do you have any hobbies or interests outside of your job? A: Not particularly. I like watching movies, reading novels, listening to music, playing games. Q: Is there anything else you want to share? (Note: He gave a long pause.)

4) When do we get the flu? How long should I wait to see a doctor for it?

Your doctor will check your breathing and body temperature before they start treatment with antihistamines or steroid medications, but sometimes the first signs of the flu are mild enough that you don't need to wait until your next appointment. But when the symptoms become severe, you'll probably want to go see a doctor immediately. The flu is a serious illness that puts you at risk for other health problems, so getting treated early gives you an opportunity to prevent further complications from these infections. And getting tested for flu is also important because if it's caught early, you can avoid having an infection (or worse). So, be sure to seek medical care right away if your cough gets very bad, especially if you're already feeling feverish.

5) My asthma isn't causing me any problems, but my breathing sounds more like that of someone who has bronchitis. What could this mean?

The best way to determine whether something may be bothering you is to take some time off work or school to spend time with family and friends. If you have any symptoms (such as wheezing, chest tightness, coughing), consider taking a short vacation (but only one day a week — not three consecutive days!). You might also try a different medication. For example, the medicine cholestyramine helps ease symptoms such as pain and congestion in the lungs but doesn't actually clear up the underlying cause of the condition.

If you suspect you have asthma, ask your doctor about the best treatments. Cholestyramine is the most commonly prescribed drug for this type of respiratory disease. This is what you'll usually find on your prescription label:

CHLENTRAMINE

mild to moderate acute exacerbation (including cough; nasal congestion; shortness of breath or difficulty keeping a stable airway);


bronchospasm (chest discomfort or tenderness; shortness of breath or inability to breathe without help).

You may also encounter names like ""benzodiazepines,"" which include benzodiazepines, alcohol and painkillers. These drugs are often used to treat anxiety disorders, and you may have been given them by a doctor to help relieve stress. Benzos aren't recommended if you have asthma and could potentially worsen the conditions they're intended to treat.

How is MS treated for students?

To be eligible to receive medical coverage under the federal health care law, an individual must meet certain eligibility requirements as determined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and state insurance departments. For additional information about eligibility, see The Student Assistance Program at www.healthcare.gov/studentassistance. More information can also be found on the HHS website at http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/. Individuals who are currently enrolled in school programs that participate in a student assistance program are not eligible for the HSA (see above). If you do not want to apply for the HSA, contact your local student financial aid office or contact your educational institution's financial aid staff or administrator to discuss how to avoid paying taxes on a significant portion of your income when you get married. Many colleges offer special financial aid packages for spouses of people with MS. However, these packages often include only a small amount of money that you will need over the course of your lifetime if you choose to live with MS. Your health plan should provide you with information regarding whether it offers any type of special health savings account or health care cost sharing. Some universities allow children of active-duty service members and veterans to use their GI Bill benefits after they graduate from high school, and some schools are beginning to offer this benefit through financial aid programs.

4 - 5. ""Belly Band"" Exercise (or Routine): This exercise is performed with a belt looped around your waist to keep you from leaning forward while wearing it. It uses a simple set of weighted bands that are wrapped around your torso and held by straps. The band starts at your navel and passes through both breasts, then loops down toward your abdomen and attaches at the bottom on each side. To use this routine for abdominal cramps, do the following: Hold the bands in front of your shoulders as if you were holding them in your hands. Then pull one band through your belly button and over your pubic bone, just behind your navel. Hold the other band in the same place. Repeat this movement four times until you feel an improvement in pain. If you are unable to hold the bars firmly within a certain distance, try using another weight or hold your arms slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. You can also perform the routines this way with dumbbells. Be sure to wear comfortable underwear and remove your shoes before doing this activity.

5 - 6. ""Lunge"": Sit up straight while maintaining your back straight throughout this exercise. Perform one rep of every set. Stand tall so that your heels are facing away from you and slowly bend your knees. Then reverse the direction of the movement and stand upright again. Do three reps of each set, alternating legs. Each time you complete the sequence, gently lower yourself backward towards the floor. This position will help ease any pressure points. Use the bands to strengthen your core muscles while also strengthening your glutes, hamstrings, and calves. For added benefits, perform the lunge two minutes after performing the situp.

6 - 7. ""Squat"": Lie face down with your feet about 15 inches apart on a flat surface such as a hardwood floor. Keeping your legs and hips straight, begin to squat until they touch the ground. Your thighs should be parallel to the floor when your hips reach their full extension. Keep your chest up and breathe deeply into the contraction. Push your elbows out to the sides and push against gravity to stabilize your body. Continue lowering yourself until you stop moving and return to your starting position. Rest 30 seconds between sets.

Cerebral Palsy is a rare but serious birth defect that occurs when part or all of the brain and skull does not develop properly during pregnancy. It can lead to problems with speech, balance, vision, mental abilities, hearing and language. Symptoms include seizures, convulsions, breathing difficulties, respiratory failure, coma and death. Cerebral palsy can occur at any time during pregnancy; however, it is more likely after the first trimester. It's caused by damage to the cerebral cortex (the outer layer of the brain) and is often seen in infants who have suffered head trauma. The risk for developing cerebrospinal fluid leakage (CSF) increases as the baby grows and begins to take oxygen into the lungs. CSF leaks from the eye, ear and nose. There is no known cure.

The umbilical cord (also called the placenta) lies beneath the placenta and connects to the fetus through the mother's upper vaginal wall. Babies born without an umbilical cord are still alive outside the uterus. Umbilical cord syndrome (UCBS), also sometimes referred to as ""abnormally short"" umbilical cords, is an uncommon complication. An abnormal, thin membrane of tissue forms between the umbilicus and the placenta which blocks blood flow and prevents normal blood vessels from being formed. This condition affects around 3 percent of newborns. Once the membranes of both the umbilical cord and placenta separate and separate again, the child experiences pain and loss of movement. UCBS occurs when there is too much space between the umbilical cord and the placenta, causing the cord to stretch. If this happens within 20 minutes of birth, there may be no signs of pressure on the baby's heart. When the placenta starts to detach, the infant experiences sudden chest pains that last around 10 minutes. After a few hours the abdominal muscles relax completely, allowing the baby to breathe normally. A doctor will examine the baby and check for other health issues. Other causes of ECNS include infection, bleeding from the cervix, and infections of the uterus and ovaries.",98,most common complications in pregnancy,-4.978499412536621,29,q,2,0.16292134831460675,341,1

But the studies also revealed that physical activity may be associated with better outcomes for some patients with diabetes.

The evidence for exercise as a treatment for type 2 diabetes is mixed; some research suggests it may reduce blood glucose levels while others suggest it may worsen them. However, there are several different types of exercise that are associated with reductions in blood sugar, including aerobic exercise (exercising at moderate-to-high intensity), resistance training, swimming and weight training, according to the American Diabetes Association. Exercise has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and lower overall risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Studies show that exercise can help decrease blood pressure, improve muscle function and other measures.

People who are overweight or obese should consider exercising regularly if they experience symptoms of high blood sugar, such as irritability, fatigue and thirst, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

So let me just say again – this legislation has been the subject of intense debate in Washington and will likely go through several iterations before being signed into law.\n\n

I think we all agree that the best way for people with MS or MS-related conditions to live their lives is to avoid having physical disabilities. But unfortunately, many Americans who suffer from MS don't want to risk losing their jobs because they cannot work. That's why we're working with both our colleagues on the Hill and at the State Department to ensure that we address the needs of those individuals who are unable to take care of themselves without assistance. When it comes to workplace mobility, I've heard from many people who say they simply do not wish to relocate, but find themselves forced to leave home due to illness or disability. While I recognize that this may be difficult for them, I believe that there should be greater consideration given to whether relocation is an appropriate solution. If you need an alternative employment option (whether at your office or outside) then please contact me so that we can help. Please note that, while I believe that these provisions are consistent with the spirit of the Affordable Care Act and provide additional options for those with MS or MS-related conditions, I'm concerned that such policies could cause some workers with MS and related conditions to lose out due to the increased cost associated with relocating. \n\n

However, it is not possible to predict exactly how many people will eventually experience long term disability after they receive treatment and maintain their health.

Q: what would you say to a patient who was just diagnosed with MS? A: You should talk to your doctor about getting an MRI of your brain.

gpt2-large_54,"Multiple sclerosis is a disease in which the immune system destroys nerve cells called myelin sheaths.\r

The damage to the myelin sheaths prevents signals from electrical impulses from reaching neurons in your brain, causing symptoms such as loss of memory and confusion, numbness or tingling in one hand, trouble walking, muscle spasms and difficulty swallowing.\r

MS affects an estimated 1 million Americans, primarily people over age 50. It can be treated successfully with medications that block abnormal protein production in nerves. MS treatment includes several different types of therapy including daily injections of steroids, which may help reduce pain and fatigue but do not usually slow down or reverse the progression of the disease. The use of immunosuppressive drugs can also slow down the progress of the disease. This type of treatment has been effective for many years, especially if used early on in the course of disease. However, some older patients have failed to respond well to immunosuppressant drugs because they did not meet criteria for an ""optimal response"" to this medication. In cases where MS leads to progressive disability, doctors are required by law to keep track of MS activity. Doctors must record all neurological, musculoskeletal and other complications related to the disease along with their age at onset. If you have MS and have an accurate, current medical history, the doctor who diagnosed you will most likely ask about this information. You'll need to provide answers to specific questions regarding your health and lifestyle prior to receiving any prescription drug. Your healthcare provider will probably want to know how long you've had MS, what's changed in your life since you first got sick, your physical condition, family history of MS (including past illnesses), whether you're pregnant or plan to become pregnant and when you last took medication for your MS. Other tests that may be done include blood tests to check for infection (such as tuberculosis) or bacterial infections, blood tests to detect certain cancers, liver function tests and a urine test to look for substances that could indicate kidney problems. There are many medical conditions that don't cause the same kind of serious disability as MS, so they can usually be managed without surgery and are generally covered under Medicare or Medicaid. Some conditions, however, can make it difficult to find out whether you might benefit from getting screened for these diseases.

gpt2-large_51,"The term 'holistic' refers to a variety of different approaches that aim at improving the health, well-being, or physical/mental state of individuals. They include various forms of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), as well as traditional herbal remedies such as Ayurveda, homeopathy, chiropractic, naturopathy, etc., and they are sometimes referred to as ""integrative"" medicine. When used in this context, 'holistic' can be interpreted to mean all of these approaches combined together. To be more specific about their focus and goals, holistic medicine includes all methods which aim at providing comprehensive information on an individual's physical and psychological states of mind and body, including diet, exercise, stress management, sleep, nutrition, hygiene, medication, and lifestyle changes.[2]\nA

The definition of holistic has been expanded over time by proponents of integrative medicine who have sought to define holistic based on its ability to address both the body and mind. In addition, the concept of 'health' as defined here has evolved from a general concept regarding overall well-being into one focused on how health is experienced within each human life span. Health is thought to encompass many things which can be achieved through a number of ways, but typically includes personal, social, spiritual, family, organizational, economic, environmental, educational, and occupational factors.[3][4] \nA

Definition [ edit ]

Holism is often described as a positive view of reality rather than a dichotomy between 'good' and 'evil.' However, when applied to specific medical conditions and treatments, the term has some negative connotations. Holism encompasses the idea that certain illnesses and diseases may not necessarily require treatment with medications or interventions, and thus, can often be treated without harming the patient.[5] It also implies a sense of responsibility for treating patients, as opposed to simply using them as a source of income;[6] the term was originally coined by Dr. James D. Gardner, a prominent proponent of integrative medicine.[7] Holism also focuses on the individual's capacity to self-regulate their own behavior, as well as the patient's freedom to choose appropriate courses of action.[8][9]

How do I tell if I have an antidepressant?

a) It may be difficult to recognize depression because it seems like you are still having fun but the symptoms aren't really there anymore. Try to pay attention to how your moods feel and what activities seem enjoyable. If you are feeling down or sad about something and don't want to get up to go get more food or exercise, try talking to someone to make sure they're okay. Do not give yourself any medications without first speaking with your doctor. Your doctor can help determine whether you need medical assistance. If you suspect you have an antidepressant problem, ask your doctor for advice about whether you should take it. He or she will probably recommend a different type of medication.


Can I change my mind about taking an antidepressant?

a) It depends on what kind of depression you have. Some people never recover completely, while others seem to recover fairly quickly from their initial symptoms. You might not even realize you've started out depressed until you start looking at your life differently. For example, some people who used to be unhappy would become happier once they began to look at themselves in a new light and begin taking action on the positive things that were important to them. Or maybe you suddenly find yourself feeling better once you stop making excuses for why you cannot function properly or why things feel wrong, or even just noticing that you are more comfortable around others now that you know that things will work out.

B-52,T-64 (Glioma) B-52,T-64 (Glioma), CABG (Glioblastoma multiforme) and EGFR are associated with a variety of malignancies. The prevalence rate for the three different types of gliomas is 1 in 5,000 and for all three the incidence rate is roughly one per 100 000 person years. This high incidence has led to the idea that GBM cells may be involved in the development or progression of many of these diseases. Several investigations have investigated this hypothesis. In a retrospective study of patients with a history of lymphoma who were treated with chemotherapy, a strong association was found between the presence of a T cell receptor polymorphism and increased risk of developing new relapsed/refractory tumors [27]. A few reports show an association between the genotype of CD4+ T cells and the risk of recurrent glioma or brain metastases. However, most studies reporting results from prospective clinical trials of GBM patients did not find any significant difference in survival rates after treatment. However, a recent meta-analysis by the European Association of Cancer Registries showed that patients with CD4+ T cell receptor variants had significantly decreased overall survival compared with patients without CD4+ T cell receptors at baseline [28]. Most authors suggest that T cell receptors act as antigenic targets in human immune systems, and that CD4+ T cell receptor subtypes can play a role in tumor development and progression. A further issue concerns their ability to protect against cancer. In animal models they have been shown to reduce the effect of immunotherapy by interfering with anti-tumor effects of chemotherapeutic drugs [29]. It remains unclear whether these changes in immune responses are due to compensatory mechanisms or if they represent an adaptive response against the tumour itself. For example, the CD4+ T cell receptor has been shown to increase proliferation of some human intestinal epithelial cells by regulating p53 activity and enhancing expression of key markers of tumorigenesis such as nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) and transforming growth factors β1 (TGFβ). Thus it is possible that some patients with GBM may possess an enhanced capacity for anti-cancer immunity compared with those of other ethnic groups, since CD4+ T cells may also confer protection against certain cancers [30]. Also, while there does not appear to be a clear correlation between CD4+ T cell receptor type and disease severity, a lack of correlation between",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-13.12297248840332,189,q,2,0.9593908629441624,389,0

My name's Darlene, I'm 16 (aged 14). I got my first hyperactive/impulsive disorder when i was 12 years old due to a head injury at school and a combination of poor parenting skills and an environment where there wasn't much space for us to learn on our own. I've always wanted to be a doctor but in order to do that I needed a degree and a job as they're not available in most places or I might never earn enough money to afford it, which also means I would never go into medicine.

Since my ADHD started it feels like it's been getting worse and worse. I spend a lot of time watching TV but haven't really done anything else to try and stop it until now. I went to see a specialist once, a GP and psychiatrist who could give me some advice on treatment and how far along I am with my medication. They said I need to take something like Ritalin 3 times a day for 6 months and give it up after 6 months unless I can get a new prescription from my GP because they have no idea what's going on with my symptoms.

gpt2-large_55,"There are a variety of strategies, including medications and physical therapy. For those who have symptoms that prevent them from working or learning well, the best way is to try using computer programs that help people with MS control their movements. Many of these programs use video games as a substitute for tasks. Others include exercise and movement training. However, it's important to make sure you're doing everything you can to maintain good health while managing your disease. See our page on managing multiple sclerosis.

Q: I'm taking medication to treat my pain. Is there any reason we should stop taking this medicine? \nA: Doctors don't recommend stopping all medications because they might lead to complications or side effects. If you continue to take medication for chronic conditions such as MS, talk with your doctor about how you may need to change your dose or adjust the timing. A recent study found that although many drugs used to treat chronic illnesses also affect blood pressure, no other drug has been shown to cause a significant rise in blood pressure above normal levels without raising the risk of heart attacks and strokes. It's not clear why some medicines are more effective than others when taken in combination. Some medications used for treating MS increase the risk of blood clots and stroke by making people more vulnerable to heart attack and stroke.

Q: Can I keep taking the same anti-viral medicine during treatment for my MS? What if I get sick after being prescribed an anti-viral medication? \nA: Yes. People can take anti-virals for up to five years before becoming too ill to benefit from the treatment. They can be started at lower doses (e.g., 1 mg) before you become very ill. If you do start treatment with an HIV/AIDS medication, you must continue taking it until you've had two full months without signs or symptoms of infection. You must follow the instructions carefully in order to avoid serious harm. Read more about stopping and starting antiretrovirals.

Q: When am I supposed to see my doctor about my current flare-ups? Should I call ahead to let her know what's going on?\nA: Your doctor will tell you when she thinks it's time to schedule a visit so that you won't feel rushed into seeing your doctor. This could be just before your next headache or even weeks before your next relapse. And you probably want to plan your visit out thoroughly -- make appointments for tests, follow-up appointments, and follow-up phone calls.

A: Yes, I am a person who has a good sense of touch. Q: Are there any people like that? A: There are some, but not many. Q: Who do you think they are? A: They might have an unusual name, but most of them don't. Q: What was your impression when you first met him? A: He looked very different from the others who were standing up here. Q: Why did he look so different? A: It had something to do with his face. It made me feel that it didn't make a lot of sense to just sit down here. The whole time he was sitting on this chair I felt that something odd about him. As soon as he stood up, he turned around, stared at me for a long while, then walked off without saying anything. That was the only thing that moved me in the room. Q: Did you see him again after that? A: No. But after he left, he came back by himself to talk to us again, but he kept looking straight ahead until we put our hands on him. He asked how things were going before he disappeared again. Q: You told me that he seemed to speak only English. Was that true? A: Well, he said some Japanese words, but he also spoke some Chinese words. Q: What kind of language? A: Basically, Japanese. He asked me what kind of house we lived in, which apartment building, and where we lived, but nothing else, so I thought he was just playing with me. But as soon as we started talking about it again he got really excited, and he said, ""You know, everyone says my hair looks beautiful and I want to dye it! Now I have money!"" I remember telling him it wasn't necessary because our relationship was so good; that all I needed was more time, so he gave it to me. I couldn't believe it.

Q: when you first started with this study, did you have any concerns? A: In the beginning I didn't realize what an impact it would make on me if the study was found to be harmful. At first I thought maybe I will get a cold, or maybe I'll gain weight (because of the exercise). But after three months of the diet, my blood glucose levels were stable. And my body composition changed so I lost some fat and gained muscle. My metabolism was also improved and so was my energy level. It just felt like I got healthier and more active.

Q: how was your experience with other people? A: I met many of them through my blog. There were people who had been diabetic before me, and they all helped me out. I met a couple of other women in the blog community who seemed to be pretty healthy. Some of them even wrote letters to their doctors which made it easier for me to understand why they had problems with diabetes. Another woman wrote me saying that she decided to join the trial because she wanted to improve her health and well-being and she thought that the Diabetes Mellitus Prevention Program could help her do that. She was one of two women from New York City who participated in the program. This may seem strange since most of them had no idea anything was wrong with themselves, but I think this showed that there were still people out there who were thinking about doing something about diabetes, even though their conditions weren't really severe. So I think it showed a lot of hope to see that.

Q: What does your research involve? A: We're studying 12 women. Most of us are between 18-38 years old and our age range is between 45-70 years old. The participants' ages range from 21 to 55 years old. Our aim is to investigate whether regular physical activity and dietary changes can reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications, including cardiovascular disease and stroke. That means that we need to find out if we can reduce the numbers of calories that individuals consume during periods of low calorie consumption by reducing overall food intake. For example, instead of eating breakfast every day as we currently do, we could eat smaller meals throughout the day to avoid overeating in the morning. Or we could try to increase the amount of energy we require through increased physical activity, which could",22,my risk for developing type 2 diabetes,-8.345870018005371,172,q,2,0.688,445,11

A: You can use the questionnaire to find out what you or your family members have experienced, including symptoms that may be related to MS. For example, a person with fibromyalgia might report symptoms such as fatigue and joint pain when they are active in their daily activities. They might also report other symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, dizziness, or insomnia, that could indicate a more serious cause. If someone experiences these symptoms, ask about the possibility that it is an indication that something other than MS is causing them.


What else should I do if my health care provider tells me that there is no proof that I have MS?

The fact that the health care provider has told you that he or she cannot prove you have MS does not mean the patient's claims are false or unfounded. It means that there is insufficient evidence for a diagnosis or treatment decision at this time. Health care providers need to consider the credibility of their statements carefully before making any decisions regarding your medical treatments.

If your health care provider states that there is insufficient evidence for a diagnosis or treatment decision at this time, ask him or her how many individuals have been diagnosed with MS without supporting evidence. Most providers will state that there is only one case reported in peer-reviewed research literature that demonstrates that MS is associated with progressive muscle weakness, cognitive impairment, or motor loss (see Question 4 above). If your health care provider does not provide evidence that the disorder is linked to progressive muscle weakness, cognitive impairment, or motor loss, ask them to explain why such conclusions were made based on limited clinical experience.

Ask your health care provider whether he or she believes that there is enough scientific data to support a specific diagnostic test for MS. Your doctor will want to discuss any potential risks involved, including side effects such as loss of memory function or vision problems, long-term consequences, potential complications, and any benefits from using certain tests.


How do I decide whether to undergo a test to determine whether I have MS?

Your doctor may recommend one or several forms of testing for determining the presence or absence of MS. Some doctors also perform MRI scans to evaluate for signs of MS. In addition, some clinicians prescribe medications or inject substances into the spinal cord to treat symptoms of MS.


Is there a way for me to take steps to prevent future damage?

Yes. A number of strategies have been developed by researchers to limit the potential harm of MS. These include:

Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CB",68,List of multiple sclerosis symptoms,-5.334476470947266,126,q,2,0.5701357466063348,440,11
gpt2-large_57,"In the last part of MS, the disease progresses and symptoms become worse. Symptoms can be mild or severe in various stages. For example, a patient with advanced-stage MS may have a progressive loss of motor function on one side of their body while remaining completely immobile on the other side.

The most common form of MS is relapsing-remitting (RR) MS, which causes the nerve cells in the brain to stop sending signals to the muscles. The patient has very limited movement and usually knows they are ill because they often have trouble sleeping. Other forms of MS that involve a different type of immune system attack the central nervous system instead. There are two main types of patients with these diseases: those who have both MS and T2D and those with only MS. Those with both MS and T2D might not be aware of having another type of MS until it's too late.

T2D and MS are related but they are separate conditions.

What if I have both?

There is no cure for either condition. If you have MS, your doctors will work hard to make sure you get the right treatment, such as surgery to remove excess tissue from the spine. On the other hand, there are some treatments that will help you keep your life independent, including medicines called immunosuppressants or immunoglobulins, which act like steroids but do not slow down the disease. Immunosuppressant drugs also protect against infection.

They may also find that they are unable to remember things, such as where they parked, what they did for work or even who put a car seat down for them. Onset of MS is usually late adolescence or early adulthood. The disease progresses rapidly from mild attacks to more severe, relapsing-remitting disease. However, it can take up to 20 years before you are completely free of disease activity. There are several factors contributing to sleep loss; however, these include: fatigue

poor sleep hygiene - using too much hot water, smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol or taking drugs

a general lack of awareness about one's body or personal hygiene (sleep deprivation)

lack of good quality restful sleep (sleeplessness)

inability to keep the eyes open at night, which can cause visual disturbances and dizziness

However, this was not due to any higher risk of severe reactions in people taking MS medicines. There are also some people who don't develop symptoms after taking MS medicines, but might develop mild side effects. It could be possible that you are still developing an attack and haven't fully recovered yet, so your immune system isn't ready to fight off new attacks.

Q: Is the Covid-20 vaccine safe for children? \nA: The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which tracks reports of adverse events associated with vaccines administered to US children between 1998 and 2013, shows that the Covid-20 vaccination was linked with 2 reported deaths among 10 children under 12 years of age.

Q: How often do I need to get vaccinated with HPV vaccines? \nA: Most women aged 19 to 50 can receive up to 3 doses of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine before their next period; however, if you're older than 50, you'll need to make sure you've got a full series. This includes both the quadrivalent HPV4 (types 6, 11, 16, 18) and quadrivalent HPV6 (types 4, 5, 7, 13). It also covers types 17 and 18. Your doctor will usually recommend a dose of either type 4 or type 8 after each cycle, depending on your level of immunity. As well as HPV, Gardasil contains around 250 different strains of viruses, including 9 types of herpes simplex virus, including HSV1 and HSV2.

gpt2-large_79,"No, you cannot. You can't legally do it because there's no proof that your condition is similar to the disease of another person. If you have a child with MS who does not know their parents' history, they will not recognize this as MS (multiple sclerosis). Your children may be able to get a diagnosis through tests or blood work only if they are in school and have an understanding about the disorder. If you want to give up MS and go back to normalcy, do so when you have time. In some cases, family members may need more help than others. There are many resources available at your local hospital or health clinic, including medical clinics. A doctor who specializes in MS can recommend treatment for patients with this disorder.\nThere's also the option of taking medicine by mouth called oral steroids that might ease symptoms. The use of oral medication for someone with MS is not recommended because it has side effects such as diarrhea or heartburn, and some people can develop serious infection.\nIn addition, medications can interact with each other or cause side effects such as dizziness, nausea, or vomiting. They should not be taken together. If your son takes medication on top of his regular regimen of medicines to control MS, he may experience a higher risk of developing MS later on. For example, if he gets a high dose of insulin daily, the body could begin producing too much of this hormone and causing problems, such as seizures. If your son takes medication regularly, he won't need any special precautions, but he must follow instructions carefully. This means that he must avoid alcohol and drugs that would make him sick.

Treating Multiple Sclerosis

If your child starts to have trouble walking, then try to keep moving and talk to him. He will probably start to lose strength and stop breathing. Ask your pediatrician about ways you can treat MS. You can also ask if he needs physical therapy or see an occupational therapist to assist him. Once a child learns how to walk again, he can continue to stay active and even play sports like soccer or football. Some kids with MS who never had MS before may still need treatments and rehabilitation.

Remember to tell all parents about your decision. It will let them know what to expect and may improve communication between you two.

Be sure to discuss treatment options with your child's healthcare provider, particularly if they're used on older children or teens.

The analysis of the data from the primary objective showed that there was a significant reduction in mortality risk compared to baseline when comparing the follow-up period up until 1 year following diagnosis with the time-to-death of patients who completed the study according to the defined outcomes (Table 5). The total mortality was significantly reduced by 16% and 9%, respectively, for patients treated with pemetrexed at the first clinic visit than those who received it later. In comparison, the difference between treatment groups at one year postoperatively was not statistically significant (hazard ratio 0.77; 95% CI 0.73–0.83), but it was significant for the differences over the follow-up period as well, such that the total number of deaths decreased by 11% (95% CI 2.1%–13.2%) among patients who were given pemetrexed at the initial clinic visit, 13% (95% CI 3.6%–18.3%), 18% (95% CI 7.5%–26.9%) among those treated at the second clinic visit, and 14% (95% CI 6.4%–24.7%) among those treated at the third or fourth clinic visit. There was no statistical difference in the total mortality rate between patients randomized to pemetrexed at the first clinic visit and those assigned later. It is noteworthy that these results are obtained by using a highly optimized model, which includes information about tumor location, grade, stage, tumor characteristics, and other variables related to disease progression that may have changed over time. However, the most important factor affecting the survival rates of patients receiving pemetrexed during the study period was the fact that the use of this therapy did not result in any clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life for all patients.

These are some of the common causes of sinusitis:

Treatment of sinusitis can include rest or medication. You should visit your doctor regularly to check that your condition is improving.

Your doctor may recommend other tests when needed before prescribing medications. Check with your doctor if any of these test results indicate serious problems with your health:

a high level of white blood cells (leukocytes);

a low level of red blood cells (hemoglobin levels) or platelets; or

your body's ability to fight infection.

If you have frequent headaches or dizziness, this could be due to a headache caused by something outside your head (cerebral palsy). If so, see your doctor right away.

Itching

Although it sounds harmless, itching is extremely uncomfortable at times and can cause serious pain. Itchy skin is very often linked to an allergy, such as eczema or hay fever. Some allergic reactions may need medical attention. Read more about allergies and itching »

Colds

Some people experience colds during their life. This includes children, pregnant women, and even infants. Colds usually start out mild and then become worse as they progress. Signs and symptoms may include:

fever

chills

muscle aches

vomiting

dizziness

headache

sore throat

In general the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) are based on the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III, or NCEP's 2010 recommendations.

The best way to follow a balanced diet is through whole foods, such as fruits and vegetables. However, avoiding processed foods that contain added sugars may help reduce blood sugar levels. For more information, see ""How Much Sugar in Your Diet?""

Q: when should I take my medication?\nA: The right time to take your medications depends on several factors. These include how much you weigh, how soon after starting your treatment plan you'll begin taking the medicine, the effectiveness of your current treatment plan and any other medical conditions you have or are experiencing, and whether you're using any other treatments. You can also find out what medications will be helpful at each visit by reading this fact sheet. If you're taking another drug, ask your doctor if it might affect your dose. See How Much Medication Do I Need?

Q: how long do I need to maintain my diet? A: People who lose too much weight tend to gain a lot of muscle mass while maintaining their weight loss. This means they must start eating again to regain their lost muscle mass. That means gradually increasing your calories until you reach your goal weight. If your weight starts to change very quickly, you may want to consider losing some pounds first before gaining them back. Also note that not all people who lose weight will keep it off. Many people gain a significant amount of excess body fat during this process, so it's important to watch yourself closely while following a healthy diet. Also, when you've started a healthful diet, you probably won't notice a difference between where you were at 5 years ago and where you are now. Q: how many times can I lose weight before becoming obese? A: The American Medical Association recommends 2.5% per year. Some experts believe 3% per month would be better than 1%. It is always preferable to try to eat less frequently but no more than every two days. Even if you lose weight, don't stop exercising! If you continue to exercise regularly even though your weight decreases, it can actually increase the likelihood of developing type II diabetes later in life.

gpt2-large_53,"A therapy that helps people live with and understand their emotions. Psychotherapy involves helping the person cope with feelings, thoughts and behaviors by changing them, using positive reinforcement techniques, and talking about difficult issues. Some of these may include:

Relaxing and focusing on the present moment

Embracing your strengths rather than suppressing your weaknesses

Learning to accept yourself as you are and learn to value yourself for who you really are

Treating problems in a constructive manner rather than blaming others or trying to fix things at your own expense

Finding ways to let go of anger and hurtful feelings

Recognizing when something triggers painful memories

Getting help from others if necessary

Having someone else (usually a parent, spouse, friend) come into your life to support you through times of difficulty

Knowing how to manage feelings safely and appropriately

Understanding how to use different coping skills (e.g., self-care, relaxation, sleep, exercise, etc.) and what they mean in everyday life

In addition to providing emotional support, therapy can also help prevent symptoms of depression, such as low moods, anxiety, insomnia, loss of interest in activities, lack of energy, poor concentration, and so forth. The treatment process uses lots of cognitive behavioral strategies and a variety of behavioral interventions. For example, CBT can be used to teach people to:


Understand their feelings

Know which emotions are most important and why

Learn new skills to deal with stressful situations

Identify unhealthy habits such as drinking excessively, smoking, overusing certain medications, overeating, being too hard on themselves, or avoiding social events

Develop healthier eating habits and reduce stress

Plan ahead, and stick to it

Think carefully before doing anything that might trigger an emotion

Create healthy routines that keep you happy

Find ways to give and receive positive feedback and encouragement

Use tools to overcome resistance to change or challenge your beliefs

Participate in peer groups or other supportive environments.

Therapists work with clients through group sessions, individual therapy, telephone calls and letters, and online counseling. They sometimes conduct in-person sessions as well as telephone consultations with client family members, friends, and even doctors. Many therapists specialize in particular areas, including:

Q: What causes type 2 diabetes?\nA: Type 2 diabetes occurs when there's too much or too little blood sugar in the body. People who have a parent or sibling with type 2 diabetes also have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Many of these people develop type 1 (younger) diabetes after adulthood.

Q: How do I know if my child has diabetes?\nA: You can check your child's blood sugar levels on the computer. Your doctor will tell you what kind of foods are best for them, but this does not mean they should eat those foods every day. Diabetic children often need special food diets. They should get their glucose measured at least once a month. You can learn more about how to do that here: http://www.diabetes.org/resources/guides/glucose-monitoring/. For adults, look at your child's medical records for any type 2 diabetes diagnosis as well as other information. If a family history of diabetes is present, ask your child's primary care physician whether he or she plans on giving him or her insulin injections.


Do I Need to Tell My Child?

A: No. As long as your child continues to follow recommended guidelines and is taking his or her prescribed medications, he or she should receive the insulin shots without hesitation. When necessary, you could choose to talk to your child's doctor about what he or she should or shouldn't consume during meals or snacks. The doctor should counsel your child to limit carbs and sugars throughout the day.

If your child has certain medical conditions such as kidney problems, heart disorders, or obesity, your child should speak to his or her health care provider about ways to manage the risks and benefits of eating certain foods during certain meals or snacks.

Should I Talk to My Child About Eating Sushi? \r

A: Yes. Eating sushi is associated with reduced rates of diabetes. However, eating sushi does not automatically mean someone is diabetic.

How To Deal With Neck Pain - Symptoms/Diagnosis Q: Hey there, my neck isn't hurting anymore. What's wrong? What should I do? A: As long as it feels good, it doesn't mean you aren't having neck pains. It could be something very minor and easily fixable (like getting enough sleep). Also, sometimes you might think that the problem is being caused by something inside your body (such as some cancer), but if you keep taking care of your body, the pain will usually go away. Here are a few things to try: 1. Doze off 2. Eat less 3. Take a hot bath 4. Get into a comfortable position 5. Use ice or warm water 6. Try using compression bands 7.

gpt2-large_126,"Pregnancy rates are high for those without contraceptive use.

Birth Control Use During the Pregnancy Cycle

Fetal and Child Development

Numerous studies have shown that the risk of adverse effects on human development is greatest in women who delay starting or stopping their period during pregnancy. In an earlier study, approximately 5% to 8% of all pregnancies were terminated because of maternal abnormalities (e.g., pre-eclampsia), 4% to 6% due to preeclampsia, and 2.5% due to other conditions (1). Although this finding may not be surprising, it has also been reported that the incidence of a number of birth defects is lower among pregnant women with irregular menses than among those who do not experience irregular periods. Some of these birth defects include mental retardation, cleft lip/palate, heart defect, and craniofacial anomalies such as anencephaly and spina bifida. The most widely studied and documented risks of pregnancy associated with delayed menses during pregnancy are fetal growth restriction and decreased birth weight (2,3,4). For example, in one study, the average duration of postpartum abstinence from oral contraceptives was 3 years, whereas in another the average length of abstention was 7 years (5). One recent review found that in the United States, about 1% of pregnancies occur before 37 completed weeks of gestation (6). Therefore, although pregnancy can still result in adverse outcomes, there are more than enough reasons to postpone or stop taking oral contraceptives if you decide to become pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant. If you are planning to get pregnant soon after your last period, discuss your intentions with your health care provider.

Pediatric Adverse Reactions Associated With Oral Contraceptives

In pediatric patients, the long term effects of hormonal contraception depend greatly upon whether a child takes the pill at the same time each month and how well she manages her symptoms (7,8). These children often develop severe acne with or without seborrheic dermatitis, which leads to painful peeling of the skin; they may also develop hair loss, resulting in permanent baldness. They also have higher rates of breast and uterine cancer compared with nonusers and their mothers. Furthermore, if they take the pill continuously during their adolescent years, there is a greater likelihood that they will need surgery (9). Because there have been no reports of serious side effects in pediatric patients using oral contraceptives, the potential harm is small when compared with the long",126,birth control suppression antral follicle count,-11.764548301696776,45,q,2,0.38461538461538464,397,5

Treatment Edit

The treatments are usually more effective when administered during the first few days after infection. These treatments include oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, inhaled corticosteroids, and inhaler therapy. The most common type of treatment is given with an aerosol of antibiotics in a plastic bag.

Sick patients who receive IV antibiotics at home are often treated with oral rehydration salts. Because this medication can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, it must be delivered through a vein in a patient's arm instead of via a nasal tube. This is commonly used because it allows for easy monitoring and control of blood pressure and pulse rate. This is especially important in children under 5 years old whose circulation is limited due to low growth. Children need not have had their eyes washed before receiving an IV antibiotic injection. When using this method, a pediatrician should evaluate the child's heart and lungs prior to administering the medication.

Other methods are also available to treat asthma, including:

Oral steroids: these injections are taken orally for several weeks until they become ineffective. They help alleviate bronchial congestion, which sometimes causes difficulty breathing, but not much improvement.

\r

That was until 2011 when I started noticing that my MS was getting worse. There wasn't any treatment in place then, so I went for an MRI scan. Afterward, I learned that there might not have been any MS activity in my brain. The next day I received an email from the neurologist who did my MRI saying, ""This looks like cancer."" So that was the start of my diagnosis with relapsing multiple sclerosis, or rMS.\r

What are your thoughts about people who say their brain gets better when they stop smoking?\r


\r

Well, if it happens that way, what does it mean? Smoking may help cause cognitive decline, but that doesn't necessarily mean you'll become less intelligent. What it means is that your brain takes up more space, and that's one reason why smoking may increase your risk for Alzheimer's disease and other dementia later in life.\r

\r

If it turns out that no matter how much you smoke, you don't have the same damage you once did, and your memory improves, are you OK with that?\r

\r

No. If your mind suddenly changes after years of being plagued by terrible memories, that's a sign you have a neurological disorder. That's why I keep track of my moods over the course of many months. Sometimes I feel good, sometimes I feel bad, but overall, I think the changes in my mood reflect my brain going through a bit of a transition.\r

The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of a low dose (0.02–1 ng/ml) of parenteral chemotherapy in patients with breast-cancer that has metastasized outside of the breast or whose tumor has not been surgically removed. The trial will be conducted at our center from June 2012 to May 2014.

Methods

Patients and procedure

Inclusion criteria were patients who presented with a primary diagnosis of localized or distant breast cancer; had received surgery within 1 year prior to enrollment in the study, but did not have removal of their breast; underwent no radiation therapy or chemotherapy within one year prior to enrollment in the study, although this was defined as no more than 3 years before enrolment; and had an overall survival time of less than 7 months. Patients also required evidence of a positive family history of breast cancer, either direct blood test results or histological confirmation of estrogen receptor-positive disease. All other eligibility criteria were met by all subjects. Eligibility requirements did not include any form of hormone replacement therapy, which has been shown to affect the outcome of women undergoing hormonal therapies for breast cancer.

After receiving informed consent, all eligible participants gave written informed consent about the procedures described below. In addition, each subject provided a saliva sample for analysis.

Study design and baseline characteristics

Subjects received 2 treatments: a lower dose of parenteral chemotherapy (20–50 mg/m3) and an upper dose of parenteral chemo (100–500 mg/m3). Both drugs are administered in a double-blind fashion under standardized conditions. Subjects underwent evaluation and treatment protocols for up to three weeks following receipt of the first dose. During this period, the investigator assessed the patient's response to treatment and evaluated for adverse events. Subjects were followed up until all data were available (median follow-up, 9 days). Patients were considered cured if they completed at least 28 consecutive days without nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, breast enlargement, breast pain or change in appearance. If subjects experienced nausea or vomiting after treatment, these were treated promptly with intravenous fluids and antiemetic medications.

During the course of the treatment period, subjects attended weekly assessments with the investigator. At the end of the treatment phase, each patient was allowed to return home. To ensure compliance with the study protocol, all patients were encouraged to maintain a",118,stage 4 triple negative breast cancer treatment,-11.30203914642334,123,q,3,0.5515695067264574,400,11

Menopause may be one of the many symptoms that include increased fatigue, memory loss, joint pain and weakness. In MS, menstruation, breast milk production and reproductive functions are all affected by the disease, although some women respond favorably to treatment with estrogen or progesterone. However, there is no scientific evidence linking MS symptoms with menopausal symptomatology such as hot flashes, hot flushes, insomnia and mood swings. Instead, researchers believe this relationship is related to an imbalance between estrogen-like substances and testosterone-like compounds in the brain and spinal cord. Since these ""male hormones"" control sex drive and sexual behavior, it makes sense that menstrual cycles might play a role.

If you are diabetic, this is not an option unless you need to lower your insulin level – which can be difficult if you're trying to lose weight or maintain your blood glucose levels without the use of medication. But there are other ways to do that. It's very easy to make ketones, so just keep eating until your body produces enough to see some benefit.

A common misconception among people wanting to adopt ketogenic diets is that they must consume all fat at once as opposed to consuming a wide variety of foods (such as carbs) throughout the day (a la Atkins) because it takes longer for the body to convert fats into fuel. This is incorrect. The more carbs you eat, the faster your body will begin converting them into energy. So in order to get the most benefits from such a diet, you should only take a small amount of each food – about 10-15 grams per meal. However, you don't want to take too much carbs; the goal is to build up glycogen stores before you start burning the stored sugars from those carbs. In fact, when you first learn how to make ketone bodies, it is advisable to avoid any high glycemic carbohydrates.

How Ketosis Works

Ketogenesis, or ""ketosis,"" is the process by which your body converts food into usable fuel. As we've already established, you can't go hungry while following a low carb diet. Therefore, after a certain amount of time has passed, your body begins using glucose for fuel rather than sugar. You'll soon notice your appetite goes down, your skin gets brighter (and pinker), and your digestive system becomes used to eating carbs. All of these effects are accompanied by improvements in blood sugar control (lowering your blood pressure and improving your heart health).

It also means that even though you're eating less carbohydrate overall, your body is still being fed glucose, but at a reduced rate – making sure the ketones continue to build up in your bloodstream (instead of accumulating around your liver or kidneys). Because of this effect, a ketogenic diet does not cause weight loss.

Because your body doesn't need to store excess fat as fat, a diet like a ketogenic diet can actually help prevent type 2 diabetes by lowering triglycerides. These cholesterol-laden particles accumulate on artery walls, preventing blood flow.

It's clear from these responses that many doctors have little patience for people suffering from chronic conditions that leave them exhausted, disorganized, isolated, and unable to maintain their professional relationships with family members, coworkers, and clients.

PMS is a very serious disorder, but there are also many side effects that can occur for those who have MS. The following are just some of the side effects that people report after taking PMS medications. If you or someone in your family has experienced any of these symptoms, please call 1-800-356-4434 for help finding an MS treatment center.

Common Side Effects Associated With PMS Medication

• Nausea and vomiting • Difficulty concentrating/thinking • Increased appetite/weight gain • Rash • Tiredness • Sore throat • Dry mouth • Decreased vision • Weakness/muscle weakness • Low energy level

What Should You Do Instead of Taking PMS Medications?

You should try to reduce the risk factors associated with MS so you may avoid having MS in the future. Here are some tips to keep you healthy:

Eat a balanced diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low fat dairy products, lean proteins, fish, beans, nuts, seeds, seeds, and whole grain breads (whole grain bread products such as wheat, barley, rye, and oats). These foods provide essential nutrients needed by everyone during periods of increased inflammation. Choose foods like fruits, dark green leafy vegetables, eggs, avocados, peanut butter, soy milk, raw nuts, fish, tofu, tempeh, nuts, dried fruit, and protein powder to replace saturated fats found in meat, animal products, oils, and refined carbohydrates. Eat at least 30 minutes before meals to decrease the possibility of stomach acidity from cooking and eating too quickly. Consume small amounts of water throughout the day to ensure adequate hydration. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids throughout the day and especially after exercise, which can increase the likelihood of dehydration. Drink lots of water while exercising. Use antacid medication to prevent dehydration if necessary. Avoid drinking alcohol and caffeine during periods of high stress due to MS. Consider reducing the amount of physical activity in order to minimize the potential for muscle damage due to MS.

If your doctor tells you to stop taking PMS medications, make certain you take these steps within 72 hours to remain protected from the complications of MS. This includes:",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-4.312037944793701,24,q,3,0.11764705882352941,365,4
gpt2-large_54,"It changes because of the disease process itself. MS is an autoimmune disorder, meaning it's not just one thing that you have to get rid of or something that requires medication. In addition, it's also caused by a protein called TNF-α, which is produced by white blood cells and plays a role in inflammation (inflammation) in your body. That protein is part of the immune system. When you are exposed to high levels of this protein in your environment, it can make your skin and joints more vulnerable. It may also affect your ability to breathe. \r

A person with MS has progressive loss of nerve fibers throughout their bodies, resulting in weakness and numbness. As the number of nerves decrease, muscle function declines. The symptoms of MS typically appear at various stages of the disease, but people who live with MS for long periods experience them gradually. Some people develop full-blown MS without ever having symptoms, and others have only mild symptoms. People with MS have different ways of getting relief from the fatigue, pain, stiffness, joint or muscle aches, numbness and other sensations they feel as a result of the illness. For example, some people take a drug called interferon beta that suppresses production of TNF-α. Others use anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen or naproxen to reduce swelling, soreness, and stiffness. \r

Some people also try to manage MS by keeping it under control. They wear a special kind of glove over their hands when working outside or around machinery that might trigger a flare up. Or they use a computer program called IMSI (immunotherapy using ImmunoTherapy Interleukin I), which takes advantage of what the body produces during a flare up. Other people use pills called immunosuppressants to help prevent relapses. These medications work by preventing the body from releasing new proteins into the bloodstream that cause inflammation. However, some people still need to take these medicines every day -- if they don't do so they could risk worsening symptoms. People with MS often find themselves trying to stay away from certain foods or beverages while managing their condition, even though eating those items isn't considered harmful for most people. Some people also struggle to drink large amounts of water. Some doctors recommend going easy on the insulin that is prescribed to treat diabetes, though many others say that can be beneficial to their health too.

Other symptoms that may be present in a person with an untreated mental illness include: depression; post-traumatic stress disorder; schizophrenia; bipolar disorder; substance abuse; eating disorders including anorexia nervosa and bulimia; and substance dependence. The National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH), part of the NIH, has developed a set of diagnostic criteria to diagnose each mental health condition. These criteria help identify individuals at high risk for developing more serious mental health conditions.

What is a mental health problem? A mental health problem is a mental health condition caused by a psychological disturbance that affects behavior or thought processes. This includes such things as a personality disorder, emotional dysregulation, mood instability, severe social impairment, impaired judgment, impulsivity, poor concentration, learning disabilities, cognitive and language deficits and abnormal thinking. The term ""mental health"" is also used to refer to any individual, family member, physician or nurse practitioner treating someone with a mental health problem. \r

However, it's important to note that some mental health problems may appear on your doctor's medical record but don't necessarily lead to a diagnosis. In addition, some patients can have multiple diagnoses. You should discuss this with your clinician or health care team.


You should talk with your primary care physician before starting treatment for a mental health issue. Many diseases and medications affect many different systems within your body.

BPD does not have any clear cause-and-effect relationship with the severity of depression or suicidal ideation. It can be used as an indicator of whether someone might eventually become depressed after treatment. There are also people without BPD who do have depressive episodes that resolve in time (or even get better).

People suffering from BPD may experience a wide range of emotions, including anger, fear, sadness, confusion, guilt, shame, regret, anger at others for harming them, anxiety, panic attacks, sexual arousal, craving for attention, and obsessive compulsive tendencies. They often experience significant difficulties coping with interpersonal relationships, especially when there is conflict between their needs and needs of those around them. They may feel extremely uncomfortable with intimacy and may find it difficult to engage in healthy sex lives.

There are several other characteristics of BPD that make it particularly challenging to treat. These include:

People diagnosed with BPD often develop an intense sense of ""neediness"" toward close family members and friends. For example, they frequently seek out care when their loved ones begin experiencing problems such as substance abuse or health issues such as depression. Sometimes, they will take on this role themselves to help a friend deal with the same situation.

In addition, BPD patients may use relationships with family members and close friends to avoid confronting their feelings about their moods or behaviors. This self-defeating behavior has been known to interfere with treatment by making treatment more difficult and even causing some individuals to drop out.

The way a person interacts with others depends greatly upon their level of neediness for attention, acceptance, love, or friendship. Individuals with BPD tend to feel a strong need to belong to groups. Groups like sports teams, social clubs, religious organizations, or ethnic communities serve as a form of identity and community within which people can share personal thoughts and experiences. People with BPD tend to have difficulty forming new friendships that don't involve the group of close friends or family members that they had before diagnosis.

Many types of BPD affect different areas of life, so treating all types requires specialized treatment. To determine if you're likely to develop BPD, look into your history and current stressors. Are you being treated for your symptoms? If not, then ask about possible triggers for the development of BPD. Ask if anyone else has experienced similar challenges in their lives.

gpt2-large_123,"Thyroid hormone (T4) is produced by the thyroids in your brain and thyroid glands, and it helps regulate body temperature. However, you may also have a low T3 (t 3 ) or high T4 (t 4 ). The low T3 level can cause symptoms of hypothyroidism such as lack of energy, fatigue and weight gain. High levels of both thyroid hormones can cause an increased risk for depression and other mental health problems. Hypothyroidism often causes symptoms similar to those experienced when you are under stress, so you should talk with a doctor about ways to cope with anxiety and depression during this time. Your thyroid's function affects how well your immune system works and what happens in the brain during sleep and dreaming. If you don't take thyroid medication or follow certain healthy lifestyle habits, you could be at greater risk of developing disorders that affect your mood and cognitive abilities such as: Anxiety

Depression

Insomnia

Dizziness

Memory loss

Low libido Low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, especially in women, can also lead to sexual dysfunction. When TSH levels fall below normal, sex may not occur as easily as usual. It's important to note that many people who suffer from severe hypothyroidism don't experience any kind of sexual dysfunction. Some research has suggested that men may experience more discomfort when trying to achieve orgasm while taking thyroid hormone replacement medications. Women may have fewer orgasms than men because their bodies produce less TSH. While there isn't enough evidence yet to say if these findings apply to all patients, many people believe they do. This doesn't mean that all hypothyroid individuals will develop erectile dysfunction. What does matter is whether these hormonal changes improve your sex life. Many studies suggest that hypothyroidism treatment may help reduce sexual problems due to poor blood flow in the genitals, like having a hard time reaching climax or being able to enjoy pleasurable acts with partners.

The researchers said there is evidence for many benefits of stimulants such as methamphetamine and methylphenidate for treating mental illness. They note that several studies suggest that these drugs reduce symptoms of depression. For example, they wrote, ""Several lines of evidence show that treatment with antidepressants increases brain concentrations of 5-HT2B [serotonin 2C receptor], which has been associated with a decreased risk of depression in both animal and human models.""

However, the authors noted, this effect was more pronounced when researchers used the drugs after first taking a placebo, a phenomenon known as an ""after-treatment"" study. This was particularly true if users also took other medications to help them cope with their problems.

To test whether the effects would persist even in patients who took the drugs two weeks later, the researchers measured the activity of serotonin receptors in brain cells exposed to amphetamine, methamphetamine, and methylphenidate. Afterward, they detected decreases in some serotonin receptors in those treated with the drugs versus those not given them. But, they added, this effect persisted only up to eight days after stopping the drugs; at least for this group, however, it did not return to baseline levels within 16 hours.

This finding suggests that even after the initial antidepressant effects wear off, users' brains might still respond to amphetamines by changing their neuronal activity patterns.

""This could explain why individuals who take amphetamine on a regular basis experience adverse effects,"" said Dr. David C. Biederman, professor and chair of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. He called this research ""a big advance because this is a really good result showing that amphetamine does change brain function following exposure to its active metabolite.""

But he cautioned that the findings do not mean that all people should stop using stimulant drugs, nor that there is no benefit from taking them occasionally.

You may be able to get some relief from medication, but the worst part for MS sufferers is finding someone who can help you as you experience these symptoms and they don't know how to deal with them. Your doctor may recommend that you see a therapist. A lot of people find it hard to tell others about their condition because of social stigma associated with MS. However, if you feel comfortable talking about this, ask your health care provider what helps you cope when MS affects everyday life.

Q: Can I still work while having MS?

A: Yes, although there is not much research on whether working with MS affects people's ability to do so. Some studies suggest that patients working at home for long periods of time can develop serious problems such as vision impairment and hearing loss. If you want to continue your career, keep in mind that you'll need to take breaks during which you won't be able to work. Also, consider moving to another location. Moving could make it harder to stay active.

Q: How do I become more aware of my MS symptoms?

A: You should talk to your doctor about ways to increase awareness and understanding of your disease. Talk to your caregiver, friends, family members, coworkers, etc. to build trust and understand one another better. When you get out of bed, walk around town and be active, you'll notice subtle changes in your body.

A: As much as possible, try to avoid activities that involve using your hands or feet.

What is MS?

MS is a chronic condition caused by damage to cells in the central nervous system (CNS). The main symptom is an inflammatory disease called relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). There are two types of MS; acute and chronic (short-term and long-term); each type can present differently with different symptoms and outcomes. In general, those who have RRMS appear to recover over time whereas others may progress more slowly. A person with chronic MS has persistent symptoms and usually requires ongoing treatment for the rest of their lives.

There is no cure for MS. However, many treatments exist such as medications, lifestyle changes, exercise, speech therapy, special diets and therapies, and supportive care.

What does MS mean?

The term Multiple Sclerosis means ""multiple"" sclerosis in Greek meaning ""many"". It refers to an autoimmune disorder that affects all or part of one's body. Symptoms include muscle weakness, stiffness, spasticity (muscle pain), numbness/tingling, hearing problems, balance problems, headaches and blindness. Many people have no symptoms at all. But some people with MS have serious complications including death. Read more about MS at https://mrsfunderground.com/ms.htm.

How common is MS?

According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMS), between 15% and 22% of Americans will experience MS at some point in their lifetime. About 5% of people develop it every year. Those numbers vary from state to state. Some studies estimate that 2 million to 4 million people in the U.S. have MS, although this number has varied widely, even within states.

Many researchers believe that MS is on the rise because more people are living longer. While the number of new cases seems to go up each year, it's not clear how many of these are due to an increased prevalence of MS itself or to the use of newer medications. Researchers say there may also be higher rates of cancer and Alzheimer's",57,multiple sclerosis stages phases,-9.3709077835083,29,q,3,0.14009661835748793,380,9
gpt2-large_86,"A disease that affects one or more of the brain's white blood cells. The condition results from an autoimmune attack against a person's own immune system. It usually begins in early childhood, and is characterized by symptoms such as fatigue, numbness and weakness and difficulty walking or speaking.

Treatment: Several medications may be used to treat progressive MS. One class of drugs called immunosuppressants (which work on the immune system) are available for patients with primary progressive MS. This type of treatment has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.


In contrast, corticosteroids, which target a patient's adrenal glands, can help suppress symptoms while improving function and helping keep the body healthy. These medications are considered the standard treatment of choice for all forms of acute inflammatory conditions. They have proven to be useful for people who have had severe infections, but also for some chronic illnesses. They must be started at a low dose (1 mg per day), which is much lower than the amount most people take in pills.

What Causes Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis?

Primary progressive MS causes the death of nerve fibers that supply muscles. The loss of these fibers occurs gradually over months or years, leading to muscle atrophy in the affected area. People with this form of MS do not experience any symptoms that would indicate that they are dying of old age, according to the American College of Rheumatology. In fact, many cases of progressive MS are not associated with aging.

Researchers are still studying what causes this disease and how it develops. But there appear to be several major factors involved. The first is inflammation caused by infection or another immune response. Inflammation stimulates cells that produce substances that damage nerves; these substances cause lesions to develop across the brain and spinal cord. Finally, other environmental factors like stress or diet play a role.",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-1.3589603900909424,54,q,3,0.40601503759398494,316,6
gpt2-large_93,"Yes, we have seen a link between sleeping disorders and MS. I think that sleep issues are the number one reason why people with MS sleep less than other people. Some of those sleep problems may be related to MS but it is unclear whether they are actually causing MS or not, so I would say this is an important question for further research. \r

I also want to add some personal experience, because my own story has been well-documented in a series of books called ""The Sleep Revolution"" by Dr. Jules Moulton. So many different diseases can cause insomnia -- this is just one example. Many people with MS suffer from insomnia as well. The major problem is that there is no single medication for insomnia, which makes it hard to treat. Unfortunately, the only way to treat MS without drugs (or over the counter supplements) is very expensive. \r

Another important question is about what causes sleeping problems at night. Since many patients complain about sleeping problems during the day, sleep scientists have speculated that a person's overall health may play a role in sleeping problems at night. We know that depression seems to worsen sleep difficulties when it goes untreated -- the reverse seems true too. If you're depressed, you might find it more difficult to fall asleep. And if your body doesn't produce enough melatonin, then that could exacerbate your symptoms. It's probably also possible that some other illness plays a role in MS. For instance, sleep deprivation and lack of exercise can both contribute to MS symptoms.\r

So, do these sleep problems really drive MS? Or did MS make them worse? Is there any benefit to having too much sleep? These questions are quite relevant even though MS itself isn't directly linked to insomnia and sleep problems. This study shows that MS can cause insomnia while sleeping, but it does not seem to explain the restlessness and worry. In fact, most of the people who suffered from sleep disturbances during the study had no known history of MS before the study. That means that MS was likely to have affected the way people slept. But let me tell you something else that might help: In addition to the fact that people with MS tend to sleep better, they tend to have healthy lifestyles. They don't smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol excessively, or eat fried foods. They also live healthier lifestyles -- they avoid junk food and caffeine. In short, their lifestyle probably affects how they feel. So maybe it makes sense that someone with MS should get better sleep.\r

Yes, many organizations and support groups exist specifically designed to help those living with MS continue to live independent lives despite the challenges that come with life with MS. The American Academy of Neurology (AAAA) has launched a website dedicated to providing information and resources to those living with MS who wish to remain anonymous, including information on treatment options and how to connect with care providers. They also provide lists of local social clubs, medical professionals willing to meet at the office or at home, and programs in communities across the U.S. For more information on these and other support organizations, visit www.answerswithMS.org/support/.

BHMT, a dietary supplement of B-vitamins and minerals such as calcium, manganese, potassium, magnesium, vitamin A and E, can increase serum bile acids, which may increase the risk for prostate cancer. These results were recently published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention. (1)

The researchers studied 14,000 men from two large U.S. studies who had been followed for more than 20 years to look at whether taking these supplements increased the risk for prostate cancer. Among those who took them regularly, 9% developed early prostate cancer compared with 3.2% among those who didn't take them. Compared with those who did not take the supplements, those who took them about once per month had twice the odds for developing prostate cancer.

However, in this study, these people were mostly white or Asian men so there was no significant difference between other racial groups when it came to prostate cancer. So if you're concerned about your intake of phytoestrogens like BHMT, the best thing to do is not to add to your daily dose of vitamins C and D. Instead, try using them in moderation. This is especially true if you don't consume dairy products, since they contain lignans and have been linked to higher risks of prostate cancer in animal studies. Some research suggests that eating foods high in plant-based proteins might reduce the formation of certain prostatic carcinogens. For example, whole grains, beans and legumes seem to help prevent this type of cancer.

Prostate cancer has become a growing epidemic in America. If you're worried about getting prostate cancer, talk to your doctor before starting any new supplements or taking supplements that raise blood levels of estrogens. It's also important to monitor how much you eat each day, since some foods are known to raise breast cancer risk, including soybeans and red meat.",116,outcome prostate cancer,-8.15035629272461,79,q,3,0.3185483870967742,310,13

The average age of the population who will experience this type of disease is between 70 and 80 years old, but it can occur as late as 90 years old. MS patients usually have a progressive form of the disease. There are many causes for MS and there is no one-size-fits all treatment approach. In fact, there are no known drugs that can cure or slow down the progression of this devastating disease.

Risk factors include genetics, diet, smoking, body weight, exercise, vitamin deficiencies, certain medications used, use of corticosteroids (a steroid hormone) and other lifestyle choices.

What Causes Multiple Sclerosis?

There are three major types of MS: relapsing/remitting, primary progressive and secondary progressive. Each has different causes and symptoms. Although they often have similar symptoms, the exact cause is not always obvious. In some cases, it may be difficult to identify why a person develops MS. Some of these triggers are autoimmune diseases, viral infections, toxins, toxins from chemotherapy, blood transfusions, surgery, trauma, injury to nerves or brain tissue, anoxia, infection, alcohol consumption, immunosuppression, cancer, diabetes, traumatic head injuries, exposure to high levels of radiation or ionizing radiation, tobacco smoke, and even food additives.

Some people with MS develop MS while their immune system attacks normal nerve cells and destroys the healthy ones. This damage leads to abnormal development of the nerve cell's mitochondria, which convert energy into chemical energy. Eventually, the damaged tissue begins to die off and nerve cells begin to die. A person does not necessarily need to have such extensive damage done to the nervous system before developing MS. But if enough damage occurs over time, the result can be severe disability. If left untreated, MS could lead to death within several decades.

Why Does MS Develop?

This type of disease is characterized by inflammation of the central nervous system - specifically the spinal cord, brain stem and myelin sheath surrounding neurons. Once the inflammation reaches critical levels, the cells in these areas become unable to function normally and ultimately fail altogether.

RS: neck and shoulders stretches \u2014 This is the stretch that I personally like to use. It gives you a really good feeling when your neck starts to tighten up. I usually do this during my morning commute or in an elevator with no one around me so it does not affect the rest of my day much. The first time it feels quite strange but eventually I get used to it. You can also perform neck stretching during sex as well; just be sure not to take too long doing it!\r

""The muscles are getting tighter and stronger"". That's what I hear all the time from people who claim they're ""too tight"", ""too loose"", or ""just right"". However, if there's any muscle in the whole body that is going into over-drive during a workout session (or even worse during bed), then it should definitely feel tense. And the tension shouldn't stop once the weight has been lifted – unless you have an injury where it may make things uncomfortable for some time afterwards.\r

If you haven't already done so, start off by lying on your stomach with your legs spread apart and your feet together on the floor. Then place both hands under each arm and pull them towards your chest. At the same time, slowly lift your arms up until you're lifting your head above your torso. Do this 10 times or more and you'll see that your upper arm tends to get stiffer while performing the exercise. Keep at it until you achieve a certain level of discomfort. If you're still not satisfied, try lowering your arms further down until you reach the point where the pressure doesn't feel as bad anymore. As soon as you've reached this point, increase the resistance again and repeat.\r

Now you need to go through these exercises 2x per week. One thing about this routine will become clear once you start: I'm using both free weights and dumbbells here. A lot of strength enthusiasts use only dumbbells. So why don't we try using weights instead?

If you have chronic back pain, that may be the cause of these symptoms and your doctor will recommend treatment. You may need to limit physical activity for several weeks or months after getting relief from these symptoms to prevent further damage to your body.

The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) says:

Your immune system is a complex system with many parts that work together in order to protect you against disease. As part of this protection, it has evolved mechanisms to attack bacteria and viruses — both foreign and within our own bodies. These protective defenses include:

- The production of antibodies to fight off invading organisms;

- The release of certain substances called cytokines into your bloodstream in response to infections; and

- A number of other factors that help keep your body's cells healthy.

But not all people experience the same kinds of problems when they get sick. That's why experts say it's important for patients to talk to their doctors about how often they're exposed to certain diseases. Some common conditions that are associated with infections include:

• Influenza/flu

• Meningococcal disease

• Cholera

• Dengue fever

• Lyme disease

• HIV infection

""Most cases of these infections occur during times when there's an increase in exposure,"" said Dr. Joseph Pape, an allergist at Children's Hospital Boston who was one of the first doctors to recognize the risk factor behind asthma attacks, in 1997. ""This means that if we can reduce exposures, we can minimize the possibility of causing illness.""

Q: when to use the right supplement? A: all of them. Most supplements have some side effects that can make you sick or upset so it is important to know if they are safe for you. If you cannot find any health information on an ingredient label and/or a website does not provide sufficient details on how it works it is probably too expensive to buy this product and you should avoid buying it. You do want to know about all ingredients before taking it. A good rule of thumb is that there is no safe way to eat more than 15% of your daily recommended intake as long as you don't need more than 3,000mg per day and if you have serious allergies then 2,000mg is probably safe. If you feel like you may be getting ""too much"" then take it at least once every two weeks until you feel better. Don't stop taking it after a couple days if you start feeling bad - it may just mean you're becoming used to the medication and your body has adjusted. Always take a close watch over your body. It is best to check with your doctor before starting any new medication. A few people have had horrible reactions to certain medications and it can make sense to start slowly and give yourself plenty of time to adjust.

Q: do I really need these supplements? A: The answer depends on what kind of cancer you have. We recommend that you try out one of our vitamin supplements first and see which ones you feel comfortable using for each stage of your disease. There are many different kinds of cancers, but we believe that some basic vitamins can go a long way toward helping fight cancer as well.

""Psychology can be used for everything from making friends with someone who has difficulty seeing themselves as others see them (like a person whose parents think they're fat) to treating someone who may have a serious disease like cancer,"" says Dr. Michael Lescroart, PsyD, a registered psychologist who specializes in psychopharmacological treatments. \r

""In psychotherapy, there isn't really any one question that gets answered, just more questions: ""What am I afraid of?"" ""Is there something wrong with me?"" ""How do I know if this anxiety or depression is going away?"" ""What should I focus on next?"" ""Can I work through my past trauma?"" That kind of thing,"" he adds. \r

""You can talk to someone without getting upset or angry because you don't want to hurt their feelings and they won't hurt yours. For example, if you're fearful of talking to somebody else who seems confused or uncomfortable, try saying, 'I'll tell you how I feel.' This makes them feel less defensive by telling them what they need to hear, and you can go ahead anyway. They will find out what they want to hear rather than what they fear hearing,"" explains Dr. Lescroart. \r

""If you are having trouble coping with stress, you might consider trying to use relaxation techniques such as yoga or meditation. There are also some medications that can help reduce or prevent stress. Some antidepressants are available over-the-counter, but other medications require a prescription from a doctor,"" he continues. \r

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy \r

""Your therapist will ask questions like 'what happened?' and 'why didn't we stop him?' The goal is to understand why things happen the way they did,"" says Dr. Lescroart. If you feel anxious all the time, you probably haven't done enough self-talk, which will likely involve repetitive thoughts and phrases. \r

Some patients can have remission, but the cure rate for diabetic retinopathy in general and diabetic neuropathy in particular is very low. It's not even one percent. And it depends on the type of diabetes, what you've got, how old you are at the time. There are some people who get better with medications that help prevent neuropathy from coming back into place, so I think it can be possible, but we're still years away.

Q: What can you tell me about your own experience with diabetes?

A: My father, my grandfather, was an alcoholic when he was younger. He got drunk all the time, would pass out, drink himself sick, just went straight off. Then at age 20 or 21 he started having trouble walking. That was his first sign of diabetes. The doctors said ""he needs surgery,"" and they didn't know what to expect. He had nerve damage, and they put him on a cocktail of drugs called antidiabetic, which did nothing. So they left him there, and then he died two months later of heart failure. In our family there were always discussions about whether or not to go ahead with the operation. We decided against it because we couldn't afford it. By the time we could afford it, we found out he'd been drinking again, and it became clear that this wasn't going to be any different. My mom had lost her job due to a change in the company insurance policy; she couldn't afford to pay for it anymore. She took care of her son, and he ended up losing his job as well. Even though he never drank alcohol ever again, he continued to take his meds every day, which made his condition worse. As he grew older, he developed complications with his kidneys, and he stopped taking his medication altogether. When his health stabilized, they decided to do something drastic. They wanted to move him to the hospital, where he'd spend four days in intensive care before he was released into the community. Unfortunately, it wasn't like a hospice either, because his conditions weren't improving. Instead, they turned him over to a rehabilitation center so he could continue his lifestyle in the hopes that this might speed things up enough that a return to full-time employment could follow. They gave him his last meal, and he ate it while sitting in a chair, with a tube tied around his neck, and then he stayed there until his body died.

\nYou have to move your head very fast. It looks like you're trying hard but it's just not working! Try moving your jaw! \hint: look at that face, don't touch any part of it

\nDoing them standing up seems to make me do better

\nI'm worried about neck cramps so I'd suggest you stand with your arms relaxed (not bent) and start your breathing.

\nThis is the same for any kind of posture! When we hold our bodies straight, that causes tension at the base of our spine, which then puts pressure on the vertebrae inside them. We tend to keep our heads bent when we sit and bend forward when we lie down. This causes more stress on the back of our necks than if we held ourselves straight. Therefore, lying down makes it harder for us to relax into our positions and we end up keeping our heads bent longer than normal. It might be good to practice using only a little bit of your lower body and letting all that tension go through your legs. Then, by relaxing your hips, torso, shoulders and back, you will find you can maintain the position without much effort. The problem comes when we bend over or stand up to pose. There's no way to bring the whole body together while sitting down. So, if you want to stay in a neutral position as long as possible, don't think that bending forward in a sitting position is necessarily bad. A lot of people get hurt when they bend over while sitting and this should never be done. Just imagine having your head on a pillow. You can always roll your back if needed. \hint: looking straight ahead is almost impossible! Try to look slightly sideways.

Pregnancy Test - Pregnancy test (H&E) can be used to determine if you are pregnant, but it is not considered a reliable pregnancy test. This test does not use antibodies against the fetus. To use a pregnancy test, you must have your menstrual cycle and the sperm in your semen tested with an assay that is appropriate for your particular situation. The following pregnancy tests work well: FSH \/ \/ + Estradiol \/ + TPO; LH \/ \/ \/ TPO \/ + mIU/ml; FSH \/ \/ \/ Estradiol \/ \/ \/ TPO; IUI \/ \/ \/ Estradiol \/ \/ \/ TPO;

If you do get pregnant using this method, and after two cycles of use, you feel the need for another one, you should start with a low dose of estrogen plus progestin (usually 10 mg every other day), followed by a higher dose of estradiol plus progesterone (4-8 pills per day). If you stop taking these medications, or if they become ineffective because you cannot tolerate them, then take the lowest effective dose until you find another way to prevent conception. Some women experience difficulty stopping birth control pills from working at all. As a result, some doctors recommend starting a new contraceptive regimen before having sex. In addition, many people who want to become pregnant may not be able to conceive unless they start using oral contraceptives immediately after their last period. When taking a combined oral contraceptive pill such as ethinyloestradiol and norethindrone acetate, do not take more than 3 days between periods. You will increase your risk of unplanned pregnancies. Use an additional form of contraception until you can safely use the combined oral contraceptive pill again without any side effects.",126,birth control suppression antral follicle count,-12.172130584716797,59,q,3,0.5042735042735043,286,2

What are the signs and symptoms of MS?\r


Your body temperature can rise to 100 degrees for up to three days after you start seeing doctors. You may have difficulty speaking with your mouth open, swallowing, and walking and running. Your muscles might feel stiff and loose. Your vision becomes blurred or blurry, especially near bright lights. Your eyes begin to swell and become irritated. Your hands and feet swell. Muscle aches and pain develop around joints. People who work at elevators and escalators often report having problems breathing in their workplace. This symptom has been described by a number of different people, but many believe it comes from high blood pressure. There may also be nausea and vomiting, and frequent chest pains.\r


Other people experience fatigue, confusion, trouble focusing, memory loss, and other symptoms that seem unrelated to MS. For example, they'll see unusual changes in their handwriting or their ability to speak fluently. Some people will even have a sudden change in how they look if they don't take care of themselves. When someone does try to take care of themselves, though, MS is usually not an issue.\r


How common is it? The World Health Organization estimates there were more than 200 million cases worldwide in 2000.\r


\r

\r

What are the possible treatments?\r


There aren't any medications currently approved for MS. But there are plenty of treatment options available in case of relapse. These include drugs to reduce inflammation and promote healing; immunotherapy to help restore normal immune function; and surgery to replace damaged tissue or block abnormal nerve growths. Doctors recommend taking aspirin when you first notice new recurring symptoms, and using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and natural treatments such as massage therapy and acupuncture. A diet that promotes balanced intake of vitamin E and B vitamins also seems to be helpful for those who suffer from MS. If you're being treated for depression, talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of antidepressants.\r

There are thousands of people who want to make the transition from being an independent contractor into employment with MS. Unfortunately, there isn't much help around. Some employers have asked us to do things ourselves, though most require a lot of paperwork. In addition, the training is often short and intense, with limited information about patient care and the nature of MS itself. People still need help finding a good job and getting started when they're starting out. We encourage anyone interested in MS to contact us to see whether any jobs are available in Canada. Or call 604-723-8870. Q: Is there anything I should know before applying? A: First, you are encouraged to read the guidelines and FAQs included in our website.

gpt2-large_77,"Many MS patients have a significant reduction in immune response, but there is also an increase in inflammatory markers. It's not the same thing as MS-specific disease because the immune system is different from MS. There are some people who have a marked decrease in their immune function and others with increased numbers of cells or inflammation that may be associated with MS symptoms. The only way to know for sure is to get blood tests.

gpt2-large_1,"The typical type of disease that people with HIV face is a chronic illness. For example, diabetes is a very common chronic illness among people living with HIV infection. It may be caused by a genetic defect in one's cells or by an infection or other medical problem. There are also some rare cases of this kind of disease that occur only when a person has HIV infection but does not present any symptoms at all. In addition to HIV, there are other conditions related to HIV such as hepatitis B and C and syphilis which affect the body more seriously. These chronic illnesses can lead to serious health problems. People who experience them should discuss these issues with their doctors and obtain proper treatment.\nB: Which diseases are commonly diagnosed in people living with HIV infection? How many people are affected by each chronic condition? \N: A large number of people diagnosed with HIV infection are classified according to the different types of chronic diseases that they suffer from. These include: AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) - This is a long-term disorder affecting about 1 out of every 100 individuals. Most often, it is associated with immune deficiency disorders, which are disorders involving the immune system. \o1\People infected with HIV usually develop AIDS within their first few years of having an infection with the virus. About 50 percent of people diagnosed with AIDS die before the end of their lives. Those who survive the disease generally live relatively normal lives. Many people with AIDS go on to develop other diseases like cancer, HIV-related cancers, organ failure and other complications. Some of those with AIDS will die from their infections without ever knowing. That's why treating the infection early is important; otherwise, the disease could become incurable. \2\HIV positive patients, who receive appropriate treatment early on, typically avoid death from AIDS and tend to live longer than non-infected patients. However, there are still many deaths from AIDS because untreated HIV can cause other problems later in life. \3\Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), is another disease which affects about 10 percent of people infected with HIV. While people with HIV infection often don't know how old they were when they had the initial infection, they usually get tired easily after a while and find it difficult to keep up with daily activities. They may have trouble sleeping well. Another symptom is joint pain or stiffness. Many people with CFS suffer from a variety of problems that make it difficult to work or perform everyday tasks, including poor concentration, memory loss, difficulty concentrating, and irritability",1,What are the most common chronic diseases?

gpt2-large_97,"compared with sedentary individuals, those who are physically active have lower rates of mortality from cardiovascular disease, cancers and diabetes.

Q: what is the association between physical activity and cancer? A: The evidence suggests that physical activity reduces the risk of several types of cancer, including colorectal cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, endometrial cancer, bladder cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and melanoma. However, some studies show no significant effect on these diseases. For example, in a study published in 2006 by researchers at the University of California Los Angeles, ""people who were inactive or had never exercised had higher levels of total cholesterol than people who were active"" (1). In addition, there was also a positive correlation between high levels of physical activity and blood pressure, which may account for the reported benefits.

Q: is it true that sedentary lifestyles increase the risk of heart attacks? A: No, this is not true. There are two main reasons why this claim is false: 1) People don't work out; 2) they do exercise but their health is not improved.

Q: is there any truth to the claim that smoking increases your cancer risk? A: Smoking has been shown to raise risks of several different types of cancer, but the link between smoking and cancer appears stronger in women than men. Some research suggests that smoking increases the risk of colorectal, ovarian, liver, kidney, and respiratory cancers. Studies suggest that smokers' overall cancer risk might be reduced if they quit smoking. One recent review found ""that among adults aged 40-59 years, relative risks of coronary heart disease increased 4% for each extra pack per day of smoke exposure."" (2) Another review suggested that quitting smoking would reduce both cancer risk and death from cancer (3)

Q: are diet and lifestyle factors associated with weight loss? A: Yes, diet and lifestyle can affect weight loss, especially during weight maintenance phases. The most effective way to lose weight is through eating less food. This includes reducing portion sizes, choosing low-calorie foods, staying away from fatty foods, and limiting the amount of alcohol you consume. It's also important to limit stress and keep moving.

gpt2-large_94,"You are not likely to become very well until your disease is in remission. Your symptoms may improve gradually over time, especially if you take the right medications and keep a regular physical therapy routine. Your symptoms may also worsen over time as your immune system becomes more sensitive to disease-causing substances and cells, causing new infections or other problems. The most common side effects of MS drugs include headache, dizziness, fatigue, weakness and trouble sleeping (insomnia). You should avoid taking certain medicines that could make your condition worse for several weeks, such as those used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure and diabetes. Also, do not mix different types of medicine; instead try one type at a time. After several months of treatment, it's possible that your symptoms will have returned. In this case, continue to take your medication as prescribed. If you experience any side effect, stop taking the medicine immediately and talk to your doctor about how to best manage them. Your healthcare provider can help you decide which medicines may be appropriate for you based on the severity of your disease.

Q: How will my MS treatments change once I'm no longer taking my pills?

A: Once you've stopped using your MS drug regimen, you won't need to follow up on your current regimen anymore. Over time, your body will naturally adjust to all the changes. As long as you remain physically active, you'll still get benefits from your treatment regimen. For example, many patients who started off on an annual course of steroids find their bodies now need fewer injections. Some patients find that they're already feeling less tired. Many people report increased energy levels, increased strength, improved moods, sleep quality and pain relief. For patients who were previously taking high doses of MS medications, these improvements usually last for two years, so even if you don't see the same results, you're still getting the benefit from the therapy.",94,When will I start to feel better with multiple sclerosis?,-0.2801081836223602,4,q,4,0.018867924528301886,325,11

Q: How do I make sure I'm covered under disability compensation if I have MS?\r

A: The American Disability Compensation Act specifies which organizations are eligible to receive disability compensation payments based on disabilities incurred after September 11, 2001. According to the Department of Defense: ""Disability compensation funds are funded through federal appropriations."" This means that you don't need a waiver from Congress to access disability payouts. However, if you believe you were entitled to a disability payment because of a service-connected disability that occurred before September 11, 2001, contact the disability compensation agency to learn about how to request such a waiver.


If you've been disabled by terrorist attacks or acts of war, you must file a claim for disability pay with the Social Security Administration. But once you've filed for disability, you'll never lose eligibility for Medicare or Medicaid unless you die. Also, federal employees will continue to receive disability benefits even after they retire. Learn more.\r

Questions About Your Medical Records\r

You may not think of your doctor as your personal doctor, but he or she might be your first point of contact with doctors throughout your life. When you go to see your doctor, you probably take away information about yourself—your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, weight, height and gender—that can help you manage your condition. Most importantly, though, you'll be able to ask questions about your disease and symptoms. And this information can help you determine",63,Will multiple sclerosis affect my career?,-6.006316184997559,140,q,4,0.56,404,2
gpt2-large_59,"The most common treatment options are immunosuppressants. There is no evidence that these treatments prolong survival in the short term. In fact, many of the more promising options are not available for MS patients.

Q: do some people with MS have increased risk for brain injury? A: No specific research has examined this question. However, we know from other studies that there may be a positive association between head injuries and cognitive impairment. As long as there is only one stroke or traumatic brain injury per year, it's important to monitor all types of trauma (for example, falls) and their prognosis with an eye toward preventing cognitive impairment. If you have suffered a concussion, then your neurocognitive symptoms might improve after concussions but may persist for months or years following a subsequent injury. The number of times a person can sustain multiple concussions is unknown, however; therefore, a careful evaluation should be made before making any decisions about which type of concussion to get.

Q: if I had chronic pain at the time of my MRI scan does this mean I'll suffer from headaches later on? Is this normal? A: Yes, headaches will increase in frequency following repetitive head trauma and there is some evidence that chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is related to brain atrophy. Chronic pain after head trauma is unlikely to cause problems for decades. However, you should continue to consider alternative health management options such as physical therapy, acupuncture, yoga, and other complementary therapies until further study confirms that headache/tension associated symptoms don't occur due to brain damage or other causes. You can also try avoiding certain activities or taking care of yourself if you feel fatigued and tired while exercising.

Q: can I use a magnetic resonance imaging machine or CT scanner to evaluate my head injury? Can they tell me how much damage was done? A: Magnetic resonance imaging machines will detect only microscopic particles in the blood and tissue. Therefore, MRI won't reveal anything about whether or not your brain has been damaged by a head injury. CT scans can show structural damage or even determine whether something is still wrong in the brain. MRI can also help doctors identify areas where brain cells aren't working properly. Doctors who perform these evaluations often recommend avoiding driving, operating machinery, reading and writing, and using computers while you're resting to prevent injury to your nervous system during the examination.",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-8.105388641357422,48,q,4,0.23529411764705882,403,1

The disease can cause pain in different parts of the body, such as arms, legs or feet; loss of feeling in some areas; numbness and tingling in others. People with MS often have other health problems, including high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, kidney problems, vision problems, hearing problems and mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. They may also be at higher risk for developing certain cancers and conditions like Alzheimer's. What do you need to know now? This information is based on the latest research from Mayo Clinic.

What are the signs and symptoms of MS?

The most common sign of MS is an abnormal white spot called an aura. An aura means that something looks out of place or out of focus. You might feel like your eyes fill up or your face seems to glow. Sometimes it feels as if there are two lights, one light above and another below your head. Your body temperature can drop suddenly, and when this happens, it can make it hard to sleep. Other times it can feel like someone is staring directly into your eyes. If you have any of these symptoms and get over them quickly, you're probably not going to develop MS. There are many symptoms related to MS, but here are some important ones. An aura Auras arise from changes in the way your nervous system works. Some people see things more clearly than others. Others notice things less clearly. For example, if you are reading a book and start seeing images or patterns in a picture that normally would be seen by just about everyone else, you could say that your visual sense is better than usual because you've developed better eyesight. Auras can be caused by a variety of factors, such as the following: A stroke, injury, surgery, infections, drugs or medicines, a seizure or medication side effects, stress, anxiety, depression and medications. These triggers can affect how your mind interprets what you're seeing. You won't always notice new or unexpected visual images. For example, when your eye is working fine but you notice objects that aren't usually visible, it's not uncommon for you to see things that seem blurry. Some other examples of an Aura include: Seeing ""spots"" in pictures.

Seeing images that appear in a blur or haze.

Social difficulties may include poor communication skills, difficulty finding jobs, difficulty managing money and debt, anxiety about interpersonal relationships, depression, and other mood-related issues. Many children and adults with major depression do not understand why they feel depressed or suicidal. They may think they're going crazy or ""crazy,"" but their symptoms don't seem like a natural part of who they are. They also may believe that something bad will happen if they don't get better quickly (such as losing all their friends). In addition, if you need help, your family could be afraid to ask you for it. If you are struggling with a mental illness such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or anxiety, there may be a higher chance that you'll end up in jail because your symptoms might make someone feel threatened or unsafe. Sometimes, even when medications are helpful, patients still may need help getting out of the hospital or treatment programs. For example, if a patient has been prescribed an antipsychotic drug but isn't taking it due to side effects, you may want to try switching to another medication, or asking that the person return to regular treatment. \r

What kinds of mental health problems affect me? \nA: While no two people experience the same types of mental health problems, there are several things that may cause you to struggle with one or both of these areas: \/\ One area is depression, which affects 1 percent to 2 percent of Americans at any given time. It's usually considered a temporary condition and can go away on its own over time. Some people who've had depression before have trouble with the way they think and behave, so they may become withdrawn, angry, aggressive, or depressed again later. Others may develop obsessive thoughts and feelings related to mental health conditions such as anxiety, panic attacks, phobias, and eating disorders. These symptoms may last long after the initial depressive episode passes, often affecting your ability to work, live independently, or form meaningful relationships. Depression may interfere with your ability to enjoy life, including caring for loved ones. Other common causes of depression include substance abuse and trauma. As you learn more about this topic, we hope you'll find more information about how the following can help improve your mental health, whether or not you suffer from any specific kind of mental health problem. \r

On the other hand, if you only know one thing about sunburns, you might opt to cover up. \r

The use of herbs as medicines has been used for thousands of years, but in recent decades they have gained popularity due to their efficacy against different diseases. A number of herbs are listed on our Herbal Medicine List for more information.


Healthy, Detoxifying Lifestyle (Herbology)


1. Eat healthy, natural food. You do not need to eat anything unnatural or unhealthy to be healthy. Many people have noticed that the foods we normally think of as ""healthy"" contain chemicals and preservatives that can harm us. In fact, eating organic fruits and vegetables and avoiding processed foods is probably more important than ever before. \r

For example, an apple contains approximately five teaspoons of pesticide residue. Similarly, there is more pesticide residue in some processed foods than in fresh produce. As an alternative to pesticides, try eating whole grains, nuts, seeds, and fruit. These nutritious foods will provide all the essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, phytonutrients, antioxidants, and enzymes needed to fight infections, viruses, bacteria, and fungi. \r

2. Exercise regularly. While many believe exercise must take place at least twice per week, this is often not true. When you exercise, the muscles in your body contract, releasing hormones and substances that stimulate growth and repair. This can increase your energy levels and help maintain a healthy weight. If you're not exercising frequently, then it's hard to build muscle tissue in your arms and legs—which can cause back pain. \r

3. Drink plenty of water. Drinking too much water can lead to dehydration. According to a study by researchers at the University of Chicago, excessive drinking could result in increased mortality rates for men and women over age 65. However, these researchers suggested that if you drink enough water while following these guidelines, it would reduce the risk of dying prematurely. One tablespoon of water per day is recommended. \r

4. Sleep regular hours and stay hydrated. Although sleep loss affects the quality of life, excessive sleep loss can also be deadly for humans. Even short shifts in sleep are critical, since",51,What is holistic medicine and what does it include?,-5.043189525604248,23,q,4,0.12299465240641712,405,18
gpt2-large_114,"borderline personality disorder, but not necessarily a specific type of the disorder. A DSM-IV diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder does not preclude that there may be other conditions which are also associated with this disorder. For example, some people who have an Axis I (personality) impairment and a social phobia may also exhibit Borderline Personality Disorder symptoms.

Example(s): A patient with BPD is diagnosed as having obsessive compulsive disorder if he has a history of repetitively checking things that don't belong to him such as his socks or shoes while in the shower, often without any purpose, and doesn't feel anything when he finds them. He would be classified as a borderline for such behavior. However, his family members say he exhibits normal behavior during the day while at home; therefore, they believe his illness will subside over time. In a later examination, however, they learn from their son's occupational therapist that he had been experiencing obsessions about being told that he ""didn't deserve"" to wear his favorite hat because it wasn't one of his own design. They then find out that when they were younger, he was constantly telling stories about how he didn't get enough attention from girls and how he felt bad after all the compliments he got. This made him a loner and an observer and did not fit into their children's worlds at all; hence, he is seen by his parents as more isolated than he actually is.

BPD is usually characterized by one of three types of episodes. These may include, but aren't limited to, the following:

Intrusive thoughts (including, but not limited to, intrusive thoughts of death, suicide, hurting oneself or others)

Avoidant behaviors (such as avoiding situations involving potential conflict and social contact)

Problems with relationships (such as feeling ignored, rejected, blamed, and/or unloved)

The most important part of diagnosing Borderline Personality Disorder is getting a thorough assessment of your emotional state, including whether you've experienced these changes:

Emotional instability – either high or low levels of tension and stress

Lack of confidence

Tension between yourself and others (especially in romantic relationships)

Feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness

Anger and aggression

Confusion, difficulty organizing memories, and difficulties understanding language

Disorganized thinking

Poor judgment, impulsive behavior, impulsivity, and failure to follow through on plans or commitments

Genetic Risk Factors associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164275.t001 All of our participants had at least one prior diagnosis of RA or RAS in either family history [27], or direct observation of an RA patient during the past year. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. A total of 45 patients underwent diagnostic imaging that included the MRI (three different MRI scan types) and EKG. Of this group, 27 were found to have an MRI-negative lesion for CSF CXCR3 (Table 2), indicating a high sensitivity to detect CSF abnormalities in rheumatic diseases. These patients were subsequently confirmed with further clinical investigation using standard diagnostic tests. In contrast, four cases of CSF CXCR3 deficiency (CTRLH4/B6 or CRHL7/N3) could be excluded from analysis as they did not have a positive MR imaging result, but showed signs of a CSF abnormality similar to those seen in patients without a detectable CXCR3. The remaining nine cases could be regarded as potential negative controls. No statistically significant associations with other CSF markers are present in the current analyses [17]. It is important to note here that three patients (all from the same family) who underwent both radiologic and MR diagnostic studies were diagnosed with RAS only after having undergone clinical examination and clinical investigations. Therefore, in this case-control design, the presence of a non-invasive test may not reflect true rheumatological findings. As such, the results presented in Figure 3 indicate that CSF CXCR3 levels cannot be predicted accurately from clinical appearance alone. Furthermore, although CSF CTLA4 and CXCR2 levels could be considered predictive of RAS, the presence of CSF antibodies against these proteins has been shown not to be predictive of the onset of rheumatoid arthritis [28], which does not necessarily suggest that CSF C",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-13.07915210723877,187,q,4,0.949238578680203,359,0

What is hypocalcemia?

Hypocalcemia occurs when a person's body temperature falls below 97 degrees F (37 C). When this happens, blood flow into the brain stops and can cause damage. If someone has hypocalcemia, they may have seizures, coma, or even death. Most people don't get hypocalcemia. However, some people do. These individuals are called hyperthermic patients and many hospitals treat them on an emergency basis. Hypophosphatemic patients usually become severely ill within 24-48 hours of having their blood sugar lowered by medication, which often includes sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), potassium bicarbonate (potassium carbonate), calcium chloride (table salt), and magnesium bicarbonate (sodium carbonate). Because most people who develop hypoalgesia recover completely, it's important that doctors take seriously any signs of illness. The signs of hypophosphatemia include: Difficulty breathing

Nausea

Weakness

Dizziness

Irregular heartbeats

Confusion

Inability to speak

Difficulty concentrating

Slurred speech

Blindness

Seizures Some of these signs and symptoms last for several days, so if you notice any of these signs while being treated in a hospital, call your doctor right away. Sometimes, however, they disappear after treatment is finished. Although hypophosphatemic patients generally recover fully without further help from medical personnel, other patients may require additional medical care later on in the same day because of dehydration. This may also lead to complications during the recovery period, such as hypothermia or infection. Your doctor can assess your condition and prescribe appropriate treatment if necessary.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to pharmaceuticals, and more particularly, to a novel compound of Formula I comprising:

(i) one or more therapeutically effective excipients, (ii) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for the pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, and (iii) at least one nucleic acid sequence encoding an antibody against a member of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 family.

Accordingly, the inventive compounds are compositions that contain pharmacologically active substances having the ability to enhance or inhibit an immune response mediated by the immune system of humans, in particular, MS patients. These substances may include those known to be used in the treatment of diseases such as cancer, AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, and other immune-mediated illnesses. In addition, these compounds may also have the potential to help treat patients suffering from chronic inflammatory conditions and possibly also for prevention of various cancers including but not limited to leukemia, breast, prostate, kidney, colon, lung, melanoma, cervical, stomach, pancreatic, liver, skin, colon, endometrial, eye, bladder, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, thyroid, ovary, prostate, and testicular cancers. In the present example, the inventive substances comprise the antibody directed against the herpes simplex virus (HSV), which is considered to be the most common cause of infectious noninfectious disease, specifically genital herpes. The HAV, although known to be capable of causing disease, its pathogenesis remains unclear. Accordingly, the invention also contemplates an antigen-antibody combination therapy modulating the immune system of people who are susceptible to acquiring or passing on an infection caused by the HAV.

As described above, one useful approach to enhancing or suppressing an immune response mediated by the immune system of people with MS is through administration of one or more therapeutic agents. The use of one or more therapeutic agents can be accomplished via either oral or topical forms, i.e., administering the agent orally, or by injection, e.g., transdermal delivery methods. According to one embodiment of the present invention, an improved mode of administration of an antibody directed against the HSV can be achieved by incorporating a nucleic acid sequence into the amino acid sequence of the antibodies directed",57,multiple sclerosis stages phases,-10.949301719665527,65,q,4,0.3140096618357488,363,0

gpt2-large_93,"The cause of MS is unknown. Multiple sclerosis usually begins with the onset of progressive damage in nerve cells (neuropathy), which can progress to paralysis, seizures or other disabling symptoms. In some cases, patients experience only mild symptoms; others may have a history of severe disability. At any one time there are thousands of MS sufferers worldwide who are not aware that they are at risk for developing this disease.\nOne way to predict whether someone will develop MS is by testing their blood cells. For example, if a person's blood cell count is unusually low, it indicates they might be vulnerable to MS, but it does not mean that they need to be tested for MS. It is also possible that even if their blood cell count has fallen below normal levels, the person is not infected with the virus that causes MS, so no treatment is needed. However, many individuals do suffer from memory loss when their immune systems become weakened during times of stress, such as pregnancy, childbirth, illness, injury and other major life events. If you suspect your condition could be related to the sleep disorders described above, please see our Sleep Disorders Symptoms page.

What should I know about sleep apnea? \r


Sleep apnea causes shortness of breath while breathing deeply. People with sleep apnea often complain that they feel like they are ""breathing through a straw."" Most common among women, these symptoms occur frequently in young adults, especially those between 18 and 30 years old. They sometimes result in problems in daytime functioning, including difficulty making decisions and remembering things. Some individuals find that having less sleep than usual helps them relax. Others report feeling more alert without being fatigued or fatiguing themselves during the day. Many older adults and adolescents struggle with excessive fatigue and depression and are concerned about their ability to perform at work or school, given the effects on their quality of life.

How important is sleep in managing my MS? \r


Research suggests that sleep deprivation increases the risk of relapse. And research shows that people with untreated chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) may face increased risks of all types of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. The prevalence of CFS remains high, though, and some experts think that MS is not always linked to REM sleep loss. One study found that nearly half of people with MS who had not been taking anti-inflammatory drugs for at least three months developed acute exacerbations of their illness within six weeks.

The best way to avoid getting MS is to start your treatment at a young age. The sooner you are diagnosed with MS the better your chances will be of controlling it effectively. You don't need to wait until you're 45 to begin treatment. See our brochure, ""How to Treat MS Naturally"".\r

Can I get a vaccine for measles?\r

Yes. MMR is available in over 400 countries. Some countries have mandatory vaccination requirements that require adults aged 16 years or older to get vaccinated by the time they reach 18 years old. In some countries, such as Germany, Finland, Spain, and Italy, children must also receive measles immunity before they turn 12 years old. To find out if you might be eligible to get the MMR vaccine, go to our Vaccine Information section.\r

Why aren't vaccines recommended for people who've had an earlier diagnosis of mumps, rubella, chickenpox, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, polio, whooping cough, or any other childhood illness?\r

CDC recommends that everyone get two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine when they are 6 months old and again during childhood. This schedule helps prevent serious complications from these diseases, which include pneumonia, encephalitis (brain inflammation), severe ear infections, meningitis (inflammation of the lining of the brain), seizures, paralysis, death, and chronic health problems.\r

What does the CDC recommend for kids whose parents can't afford the vaccinations?\r

To lower costs for families making the decision to vaccinate their child, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides free immunization services through their Healthy Kids program. If you qualify for free care, you may enroll your child in either one of two immunization classes offered at the local public school or community college. Your child's health insurance provider would cover the cost of immunizations if he/she is eligible for Medicaid, Medi-Cal, Medicare, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), or other government programs. All other parents should contact their private providers to learn about immunization options that may work well for them.

If you want to take an extended period of time off without any physical impairment (ie: getting rid of the physical symptoms), you have to be on insulin. As such, it would be best to avoid taking long periods of time off altogether. \r

<b>How Can My Child Get Started On Lupron or Other Pharmaceuticals?</b><br /> <em><strong>When should my child start using pharmaceutical drugs?</strong></em>\r

A: Your child's first dose of Lupron may not come for months, even after your child has been doing well with his therapy for several years. If your child needs additional doses of Lupron, consult your healthcare provider. For more information about Lupron and other pharmaceuticals, visit the NIH website at www.nih.gov/medlineplus.\r

In addition to these drugs, people can take other medications that help with symptoms such as headaches and weakness of their limbs. In about 2 percent of patients, those medicines are known to be associated with an increased risk of developing MS. Some research suggests that taking certain types of blood pressure medications may raise the risk even more than others, but they're rarely prescribed for this reason.

When these treatments aren't effective or there's no obvious cause for an increase in disability, people have been encouraged to use a variety of complementary therapies.

FITNESS: I think that fitness is probably the hardest thing to quantify.

If you're doing cardio, then the goal is mostly to get your heart rate up to somewhere around 170-180 beats per minute.

I tend to be pretty picky about what type of training I use (for example, I'm a beginner at CrossFit), so I generally don't recommend any more than 50% HIIT or 15% powerlifting work for women.

gpt2-large_53,"A form of therapy that helps the patient cope with a life crisis. It can help with issues such as depression, anxiety, self-esteem problems and relationships. Psychotherapy has different forms to suit your needs. Some therapists will use psychoanalysis in their treatments or other types of counselling as an adjunct for the treatment itself. Other methods include cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, interpersonal skills training and talk therapy. Q: is there a difference between psychotherapy and psychoanalysis?

A: There are several differences between these two methods. One important factor is that psychotherapy focuses on the individual's emotions rather than the way they feel about themselves and others. Another important distinction is that psychotherapists typically treat patients who need some degree of psychological support at any stage in their lives. Psychotherapy often involves both therapy sessions and individual therapy sessions, whereas most psychotherapists treat only patients during regular treatment sessions. This means that psychotherapy does not necessarily have to be 'counselling' – it may involve talking about feelings and thoughts without trying to change them. In contrast, many people prefer to talk more openly about emotional issues in therapy sessions than in ordinary times. The main difference lies in the focus of therapy, which usually centres around helping you develop new coping strategies and new ways of relating to yourself and others. It is possible to combine these approaches when needed. Q: how do I find a therapist?

A: For those seeking help via psychotherapy or counsellors (or both) the best place to start looking is www.mentalhealth.govt.nz, where various government agencies offer advice, checklists and links to other organisations that provide information. You might also try contacting the local Mental Health Board. Alternatively you could try one of the numerous websites that offer online counselling or counselling services; see the list at the bottom of this page. If you cannot find anything, you should contact the nearest health care provider - even if it's just an email address. Q: will my doctor diagnose me with something and prescribe me drugs?

A: No. Doctors diagnosis disorders using the standard criteria used by mental health professionals in the UK and elsewhere. However, there is a difference between diagnosing something based on symptoms alone, and diagnosing something based on a history of events (such as what was going on in someone else's life). Diagnosis is a medical process, rather than a mental health one. Q: don't doctors diagnose all conditions and illnesses automatically?

It should be safe, well-tolerated (not harmful), not habit forming, nonpharmacologic, nonselective and not abuse resistant as it may have been when used in humans prior to supplementation. In addition, a dietary supplement must meet all applicable safety requirements including those related to human consumption, use in animals and adequate dosages of active ingredients for absorption.

FDA Approval Information The Food and Drug Administration has cleared this drug for the treatment of depression due to clinical trials conducted at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center. This drug was initially evaluated in a pilot study conducted at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine from January 2004 through June 2007 and has shown promising results. Since that time, this drug has continued to be administered in a small randomized controlled trial performed at the National Institute on Aging in Bethesda, MD. The FDA approved the antidepressant drug Paxil® as an antidepressant to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) in 2012 in a marketing application known as PLOS ONE ®. A full list of product approvals can be found at www.fda.gov/cder/drugs/labeling/.

Paxil® is intended for use only in patients who are 18 years of age or older, with no history of psychiatric disorders, seizures, diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, hyperthyroidism, or asthma; taking medications, other than SSRIs and SNRI's (anti-depressants); or experiencing suicidal ideation or attempts during the preceding 12 months. Patients should begin Paxil within 48 hours after stopping any current antidepressants (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, tricyclic antidepressants with tricyclic oxyphenylalanine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors). If Paxil fails to improve symptoms of depression, discuss the possibility of switching to another antidepressant with your healthcare provider. Patients should continue to monitor their condition closely and be prepared to discontinue Paxil if needed. If Paxil does not improve symptoms of depression, you may wish to consider using another antidepressant medication such as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). These medications often take several weeks to stabilize and will also require monitoring.

This will help prevent pregnancy, however it is important that the pregnant woman have contact with her healthcare provider after taking these medications. In addition, if symptoms occur, the patient should be observed for signs and symptoms of an adverse reaction such as nausea or vomiting. Patients can receive treatment immediately by obtaining prescription contraceptives from a pharmacy or doctor, or they may choose to postpone any medication use until the following day, preferably on the weekend (e.g., Monday) if they feel better. When the pregnant woman has received the recommended dosage of oral contraceptives in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, she should return to the clinic or health care facility within 3 days after stopping her prescribed dose of contraceptive pills. If a pregnancy occurs before this time, the decision whether to continue to use contraceptive methods must still be made based upon the clinical condition of the female individual and other available evidence regarding efficacy and safety. For patients who do decide to proceed, additional counseling should include information about potential risk factors (such as the patient's previous history of unintended pregnancies).

Clinical trials The Clinical Trials Program of the National Institutes of Health provides funding for research conducted through the NIH-funded Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which conducts a large number of epidemiologic studies to determine the influence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) on sexual behavior, heterosexual relations, and overall health. CDC also funds several other studies aimed at understanding the role that STDs play in sexual behaviors, including sexual activity, HIV infection and prevention, and the effect of sex education programs and abstinence promotion. CDC recommends that STD testing be performed routinely for all persons ages 14 years and older at routine visits to public health clinics, regardless of any prior history of abnormal genital findings or the presence of STDs, regardless of personal beliefs about these issues, and without regard to age group. These recommendations apply both to male and female participants alike, although some exceptions exist for individuals aged 13–17 years, those who were married at any point during life, and children under 18 years of age.

Solutions for MS Symptoms and Treatment

The most commonly used treatments for MS symptoms include: medication, lifestyle changes, and exercise. These remedies work well, but there is no cure for this debilitating illness. There is also no evidence-based medical solution that provides any kind of relief from MS symptoms. So what happens when you try something different?

What I like about the way you've done it is you've created a detailed plan and detailed information on how to get your life back to normal. You have explained your symptoms, your condition, and why they happen so people can see why that would make them feel better. You've put all the information together into a detailed program which includes instructions for everything you need to know to get back to normal. That makes me very confident about your ability to help others get back to their healthy lives. If you could share your program online please would you please do so? Thank you for your time!


Thank you again for taking the time out of your busy schedule to answer my questions.


I want to thank you for offering us this opportunity. Your company is wonderful and I love working with you. I appreciate every minute of every day that I'm here. You have helped me so much and I will continue to use you as a resource in the future. I look forward to meeting you soon.


Best regards,

How often should you do these treatments and how long are we going to tolerate them until we are able to return to our normal lifestyles? What are the best places in our home to do our exercises/exercises? Do you offer any special services for children who are suffering from a variety of mental illnesses including MS, ADHD, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, etc.? Also, if we were doing a lot of activities like yoga, Pilates, walking, eating good food, gardening, etc., where would we start/end each session and what kinds of things should we incorporate into our routine?

gpt2-large_118,"the current state of evidence is limited. There are no studies that have found a correlation between the use of tamoxifen and increased risk of triple negative breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Therefore, it is not clear whether these drugs increase or decrease the risk of triple negative breast cancer; this information has to be considered when evaluating the safety and effectiveness of tamoxifen.

The most common side effects associated with tamoxifen are fatigue and nausea. These effects may occur at any time during your tamoxifen treatment but usually begin within two weeks after starting treatment. It is important to know if you experience any of the following symptoms while taking tamoxifen or other estrogen-containing medicines:

Headache or migraine headaches

Fatigue or weakness

Cough

Nausea

Vomiting

Itchy or painful eyes

Shortness of breath

Anxiety or depression

These symptoms may also occur along with some other symptoms such as breast tenderness. You should talk to your healthcare provider about how to treat the symptoms. If you do experience side effects while on tamoxifen, your healthcare provider may prescribe additional medication for these symptoms.

In addition, there are many medical conditions associated with breast cancer, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery. These diseases can cause serious side effects and may lead to death. Even if you take tamoxifen, however, you need to consult your doctor before beginning any major procedures, especially when you're pregnant or plan to become pregnant.

Your health care team will work together with you to determine the best course of action for you. Your healthcare providers may recommend certain types of chemotherapy treatments that are less likely to result in long term harm to your body. If you've already had chemotherapy or radiotherapy and are concerned about your condition, discuss it with your primary care physician so they can help make an informed decision regarding which treatment option might be right for you.",118,stage 4 triple negative breast cancer treatment,-3.412249088287353,60,q,5,0.26905829596412556,315,11

You may also want to consider a part-time or limited time work opportunity. If you have MS, you should talk to an employer about the possible benefits of a job that requires working from home while you are still able to perform normal duties in the workplace. For more information, see our Work With Multiple Sclerosis page.

Q: What other resources can I find for MS?\nA: There is lots of information available online on MS. A good starting point is this list from HealthCareForAll.org (a national organization helping people living with MS): http://www.healthcareforall.org/MS_resources/

The National Multiple Sclerosis Society has many useful resources. To learn more about MS, visit their website at: www.multiple-sclerosis.org.

Q: What are some things I should know before getting help with my medical bills? A: Before contacting us with questions about your medical bills, it's important to understand what we can assist with. First, if you suspect you might be unable to pay your bills because of your diagnosis, we strongly suggest you contact your local chapter of the American Medical Association. Your doctor will explain why his or her treatment options are no longer covered by health insurance, and how you can get them.

You may also wish to discuss payment plans with your insurer or pharmacy. Be sure to inquire about whether you'll need regular follow up visits or treatments to make sure they're being done effectively.

Next, read through our MS Care Guide. This comprehensive document provides everything you need to know when you have MS and its associated symptoms such as headaches, vision loss, fatigue, joint pain, weakness, numbness, tingling, numbness, hearing loss, cognitive problems, depression, memory loss and even dementia. It goes into great detail about diagnosing and treating MS. And, remember, this guide applies only to those who have received medical care since becoming symptomatic or at least had access to it.

About MS

MS is a progressive, disabling disease that affects more than 250 million Americans and affects about one-third of all adults over age 65. It is often fatal when left untreated or inadequately treated. The average disability cost for people with MS has been estimated at $92 billion annually. About half of those costs come from healthcare expenses; the remainder comes from lost productivity and other losses associated with illness.

Although it is rare, some people who have MS develop an autoimmune disorder known as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Rheumatoid arthritis occurs most commonly in children aged 6 through 18 years old. RA can result in pain on both sides of the body, fatigue, joint swelling, loss of appetite and weight gain, joint deformity, muscle weakness, blurred vision, difficulty walking, night blindness and impaired thinking. People who carry the mutated gene responsible for developing RA can also develop another form of the disease called sporadic rheumatoid arthritis (SRA). Both forms can cause serious complications including bone marrow failure and organ damage, skin diseases, and nerve disorders. In both cases, doctors treat the underlying causes of the disease by removing the affected cells and then transplanting them into healthy tissue.",77,How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?,-1.1886519193649292,5,q,5,0.02066115702479339,221,2
gpt2-large_1,"The major cause of death in India is heart disease. It affects more than 1 billion people globally, while lung cancer accounts for about 2 million deaths each year. More than 90% of these deaths occur in low-income countries. Chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus (type II), hypertension, asthma and arthritis account for a large number of deaths worldwide. In India, about two thirds of those who die from heart attacks and strokes are women, but their mortality rates tend to be higher. \r

In general, we expect that a country which has better health outcomes will have lower levels of poverty. However, what happens when you look at what happens in developing nations where healthcare systems have not been developed? What does this tell us about how poor countries can develop? \r

The findings show that the impact on life expectancy per person was significant in both urban and rural settings with a strong link between population growth rate and the difference in life expectancy between cities and villages. Urbanites had an average 6 years less of life expectancy than ruralites, whereas there were no differences in life expectancy by gender or age group. \r

However, there were some notable exceptions to the pattern. For instance, while there was a strong relationship between a country's income level and life expectancy, it did not differ significantly by sex and age groups. As well, the correlation between income level and life expectancy varied substantially among different regions. When we looked only at urban areas, income was not associated with life expectancy. Likewise, the relationship between income level and life expectancy was much weaker in rural areas. In contrast, the positive relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy was strongest in urban areas and weakest in rural areas. This finding suggests that high incomes provide benefits to individuals in urban areas because they are able to consume more consumer goods and services while living longer. Conversely, poor households in rural areas may lack access to capital and face difficulties accessing credit markets. In other words, rural populations in sub-Saharan Africa experience greater vulnerability to economic shocks than urban populations. In addition, the negative impact on life expectancy observed between 1990 and 2010 was larger in urban settings than in rural ones, although the effect of income could be partially explained by the fact that the study sample included urbanites and rural residents of all ages and education levels. \r

Overall, we see that while the income gap is narrowing in many developing countries, there remains considerable variation across countries in terms of differences in longevity.

First off I have had a diagnosis for 5 years and it is known that I don't need to be around other people with MS because I was diagnosed when I had no symptoms. So if people are looking for someone who needs a job to get through the day, or something else where they could find me and have me be an asset in the workplace, that's going to change a bit. Second, I am very clear about what is expected of me now. I know exactly when my turn is coming and I am going to do everything possible to meet that deadline. Third, I've done enough research on MS to know that I'm not going to have any problems getting hired or finding employment again as long as I stay within those parameters. The last thing I want to do is put myself in a position where someone sees that I can't function normally but doesn't realize I might be living with a disability. I've got to keep my head up and not let my symptoms take over my life because they'll always come back to bite me. Q: you mentioned your time in medical school before getting into medical practice. What role did you play at all as far as teaching and mentoring patients during your residency? A: It was mostly a lot of explaining how different treatments worked. Not really much clinical experience. Also I wasn't taught how to read patients' charts. In fact I think there were only 3 courses we ever took together, one being a group, and two were individual seminars. They were pretty basic classes, so I didn't learn anything new. Q: how did you deal with family members who wanted more information than was available from your website? A: My parents thought I would be doing better as a physician if I went on to medical school. But when I started my residency program, I realized just how limited their knowledge was, and then when I became the resident assistant and saw first hand how many patients they missed due to time restrictions, they stopped coming to see me. After seeing these numbers every single year, I knew that I needed to go beyond my training and start educating them. This is why I created The MS Society. If doctors weren't aware that they were missing patients because they weren't able to make appointments, I figured I should have made that available by now.

gpt2-large_35,"No, but you can make it work by reducing carbohydrates and increasing protein. For example, if your blood sugar is controlled, cutting back on calories from carbs will allow you to eat more fat without losing weight. You should also get enough sleep (or as much as possible) \r

so that your body is less sensitive to insulin \r

and allows it to use fatty acids in your liver to produce energy. See our guide to the basics of ketosis for more information about what this means! If you're concerned about gaining too much weight or not achieving good results with a ketogenic diet, try switching to low-carbohydrate diets (such as Atkins or KetoDiet). They don't contain any sugar or refined carbs \r

(except for lactose), so they'll be easier to manage than a high-fat, low-protein diet. \r

If you have other health conditions or illnesses that could affect glucose control, such as kidney disease, heart disease or stroke, we recommend that you take insulin before taking ketone supplements. This will help keep your glucose levels under control \r

while providing some extra energy. Read more about how to achieve optimal glucose control. Q: What are ketones made out of? A: Ketones are produced when fats are burned for energy, but they aren't actually converted into fuel \r

unless they come in contact with oxygen. When you burn fat for energy, you generate carbon dioxide (CO2); however, CO2 doesn't do anything good \r

when you have elevated blood glucose, which is why your metabolism slows down when you have diabetes. The most important role that carbon dioxide plays is to prevent oxygen from getting inside cells. Carbon dioxide traps excess water \r

in the cell walls, preventing them from dilating. In contrast, ketones can free up space within the cells, allowing them to stay open longer \r

so that new mitochondria grow and flourish, making them more efficient at using energy. Q: How many grams of protein per day do I need? Are there any special considerations around protein intake? A: Protein needs vary depending on whether you're following a low carb diet or a ketogenic diet \r

as well as how long you've been eating ketogenic diets. On a low carb diet, you typically require between 150 and 250g of protein per day. That's around 5% - 8% of your total daily calorie intake \r

\r

Practice is a very important part of the process of improving. You can't force yourself to do any exercise unless you want to fail at something you've tried before. If you don't practice, then you won't be able to progress.\r

\r

If you feel like practicing, try it once or twice but never more than one or two times each day. This way you learn about how much pressure you should put on your joints, muscles and bones, so that the body develops stronger muscle tone and a firmer spine.\r

Try to pick an exercise that's simple enough for people who aren't used to doing this kind of work. It shouldn't require a lot of time to make sure it's good for your back. Take the time to figure out what makes sense for you. Don't just jump into something if you think it sounds easy. Try it first and see what happens! \r

\r

After making sure you enjoy the process and don't lose interest, start training! The only thing you need to know is that you need to keep pushing yourself until your body gets strong enough to stand on its own legs without support. Once it does that, you can take it slowly from there. Once you're able to lift heavy things (like weights), you can start learning basic moves like pushups or pullups. Eventually you might even begin jumping around the gym, trying new things to build strength in your upper-back area. \r

\r

Once you reach a point where your lower back feels comfortable standing on its own, move onto another type of exercise. Start off with squats, which have become popular as a way to increase stability and reduce hip flexor pain. But be careful not to start squatting too far back because that increases the risk of injury. After that, you can try lunges. They may seem complicated, but they really help strengthen your core while increasing flexibility. Next up, deadlifts. Although these are more advanced movements than squats or lunges, they can help you develop all three. You can use different weight plates depending on what size you are.

Q: Are there any ways to tell if someone will go through a workout? Can you tell what they look like or are they slim but not fat?

A: There's no way to tell at all unless you ask them after they leave the gym, but we certainly try to make sure that they're pretty healthy for themselves. When we start asking questions we see some amazing results, like people coming out looking like they've never had any other form of exercise before. They often say things like ""I haven't had a gym class in my life,"" which is a very good sign because usually people are pretty active before they begin getting into weight training. Once they stop exercising they tend to lose muscle mass quite quickly. It's interesting to watch as a person gains muscles from exercise, but they also lose strength which is another important thing to notice. So, in terms of monitoring, a lot of it comes down to being honest about what you're doing. As long as you're honest about how hard you're working, whether it's 60 or 100 reps per set—that means the harder you push yourself, the more strength you gain. Then you need to see improvement over time to know that someone is actually gaining muscle mass. In the end we want to be able to tell if they'll eventually work up to doing some kind of heavy lifting. For instance, if you asked people five days out of five if they would ever run 100 miles, only 10% would respond affirmatively, whereas if you told them five days out of five that they'd become physically stronger, 75% would respond affirmatively.

In response to a question from the audience, she said that her husband is ""dying"" and that they need to keep their family together as much as possible while still doing things for themselves, including writing novels. She also thanked the audience for coming out.

Her wife, who also received an honorary doctorate in literary studies in 2014 from Harvard University, was born with multiple sclerosis (MS), which affects around 7 million people worldwide. It causes weakness and numbness in muscles and joints. The disease can be treated with medication, but it can become debilitating and difficult to live with even if symptoms are controlled. In addition, research suggests that those with MS tend to experience reduced cognitive abilities during early life. That can make it hard for caregivers to understand why an individual may not want to work or play normally. While many families don't believe there's anything wrong with their children, others choose to hide them.

At the time of her diagnosis, Nicole had no idea what it meant until years later, when she learned that she would never again be able to walk without help. When asked whether she had ever considered telling her parents, she responded with a laugh, ""No.""

She continued:

My mom [said]: 'Are you sure?' And I didn't say yes, because this wasn't something I could talk about easily. It just came right up and hit me at once. But I knew that I needed to tell them. If someone told my sister-in-law, she'd probably go crazy with worry because she knows my situation as well. So, that gave me a lot of energy to think of my sister-in-law and ask her questions, like, 'Can you explain MS to me?' or 'What do I need to know about MS and how does it relate to my job?'

After she decided to disclose her condition to her employers, she recalled that ""it was really scary."" She added that she thinks she might have started to come out earlier than she should have, since she first became aware of her disability in 2013 and then after it took effect last year.

gpt2-large_54,"Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system in which abnormal cell growth and inflammation are responsible for damage to the nerves. The most common signs or symptoms of multiple sclerosis can be divided into two main categories: 1) pain-related (such as swelling, muscle weakness, tingling), 2) fatigue-related (such as difficulty with concentration). Pain, muscle stiffness and tiredness may occur on its own or after other conditions such as infections or fractures. However, both kinds of symptoms are also present if there is damage to the nerve cells.\nA: As described above, multiple sclerosis affects about 0.5% to 5% of the population. It is estimated that this number will rise significantly by 2020. According to the latest report from the World Health Organization (WHO), there were an estimated 3 million people living with MS worldwide at the beginning of 2015. That's up from an estimated 300,000 in 2006; however, it could be much higher. In addition, the numbers of people diagnosed with MS vary widely across countries. For example, South Korea has one of the highest rates of all developed nations. There have been reports of patients being treated with immunosuppressants that cause increased risk for death. However, research shows that these drugs do not increase the risk of death in the long run and actually reduce disability.\nB: Multiple sclerosis causes severe disability due to an immune system attack against the nerves and brain. Patients usually experience significant cognitive difficulties as well. They often need frequent trips to the doctor because their lives become very difficult. Often the person suffers from constant pain. Because MS develops gradually over years, treatment is limited to controlling symptoms and preventing further damage to the nerves. Even though patients' overall quality of life improves, patients may still require ongoing care. In fact, many studies show that MS patients must remain healthy, even when they get older, in order for the condition to improve. Therefore, it makes sense for doctors to try to prevent future complications so that no one is left without access to healthcare. Additionally, MS requires treatment with anti-inflammatory medications. In some cases, these medicines may help control the inflammation and give the body time to recover. In contrast, more expensive medical devices like artificial joints or wheelchairs aren't effective in the long term because they don't allow the body enough time to heal itself.\nC: People who develop MS can be divided into three subtypes based on how quickly the disease progresses.

In recent years, the number of U.S. physicians who have seen psychiatric patients has grown from 3% to 4%. In 1991, only 10% had seen such patients. This number has since increased to 17%, and it will likely increase further as new technologies improve the accuracy of diagnosis. \nA: Depression is associated with many factors, but one common factor is poor quality sleep. Sleep deprivation increases the risk of major depressive episodes and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. People with sleep disorders often experience daytime drowsiness, anxiety, fatigue, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. Other potential causes include excessive alcohol use (including binge drinking), drug abuse, poor diet, and stress.\nA: According to the National Institute of Mental Health, 5 million Americans suffer from some type of substance abuse or dependence, about 2.5 percent of the population.

The system may be as simple or elaborate as one wishes, but it should not be confused with conventional methods. For example, if you are suffering from chest pain, chiropractors are often trained to apply acupuncture (a form of traditional Chinese medicine) to your chest. However, when the treatment fails, they might prescribe other remedies such as homeopathy for colds or cold medicines for fevers. Other methods may include herbal treatments, exercise therapy, massage, vitamins, minerals, herbs, etc... In this way, the doctor has not just applied his or her own ideas and experiences to the patient's problems; he or she has also used the best available scientific research data on various diseases, illnesses and conditions to determine which approach is most effective in helping the person. Some medical practitioners call these systems ""integrative"" because they use both natural therapies and new drugs to treat disease. And while many individuals who have received medical care over the years are now able to choose their doctors, there are still those patients who require regular visits, especially children and the elderly. Many people find that in order to receive good health, it helps to know some basic information about the body, its functions, healing modalities, and how to recognize any symptoms that may indicate illness or injury. When you visit your doctor for routine check-ups or follow-up appointments, you can ask him or her questions about the process.

There is no single method or theory that determines whether a given drug or supplement may be accepted by patients receiving these treatments. Many medications are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for specific indications only, which means that a prescriber must decide which one(s) of these substances would work best for their patients.

It's always good to distinguish between those who have different types of mental illness.

But there are still people out there who struggle with them. A lot of them don't even realize they're suffering from either type of mental illness! If we can help them figure out which category is most appropriate, that will definitely go a long way toward helping them cope with their condition.

Q: If you had to give advice to someone with MS who was currently experiencing relapses, what would you tell them?

gpt2-large_123,"hypothyroidism does not cause thyroid disease in adults.

Hypothyroidism is the most common medical condition in children, and it may be a problem for you as well. It's also more prevalent than commonly thought. Many parents believe that their child will never develop an autoimmune response to certain foods or medications because they have no other underlying conditions, but this is not true. The truth is that while there are many genetic variants linked with hypothyroidism, a person can inherit only one of them. But, if both genes are present, the patient may be at risk for developing thyroid dysfunction. An autosomal dominant (A-D) form of hypothyroidism, called hypo-T3(+) deficiency, affects approximately 3% of all people who are born. People with hypo-T3(+) deficiency often go on to develop a second type of hypothyroidism called hyperthyroidism due to mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor gene (Thy2). Thyroid cancer occurs most frequently in patients with hypo-T3(+) deficiency. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, depression, decreased appetite, weight loss, dry skin, hair loss, weight gain, muscle weakness, increased sensitivity to cold and heat, acne, constipation, headaches and night sweats. While most people with hypothyroidism do not get serious complications from their disorder, some people do. Some doctors recommend waiting until age 40 to start treatment with thyroid medication or surgery; others say that a person can safely begin taking the medicine by 45. If your child develops any signs of thyroid problems, talk to your doctor about starting treatment right away. This article provides information about what thyroid medicines your child may need and when he should begin or stop treatment.

How is hypothyroidism diagnosed?

Doctors use various tests to diagnose thyroid problems, including blood tests for thyrotropin (TSH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH 2 ), thyroid antibodies (Thi), thyroid hormones (TCO4, TSH, TRH, T3, free T3) and thyroid stimulating agent (TSG) levels. Thyroid function test results can help doctors figure out whether the thyroid gland has been damaged. These tests may tell doctors if your child could benefit from surgery to remove the thyroid gland. Children who are treated before they reach puberty can have normal TSH and TSH 2 levels even though the thyroid gland is still producing TSH.

Q: How do I take vitamin D supplements?

A: Taking the right type of vitamin D is essential for maintaining good health. A study conducted by the National Institutes of Health found that taking a supplement containing 400 IU of vitamin D a day could reduce risk of stroke from 35 percent to 17 percent; decrease your risk of death from cardiovascular causes from 21 percent to 10 percent; and reduce heart attack rates from 6 percent to 1 percent. To get more vitamin D, eat foods rich in vitamin D such as milk, eggs, green leafy vegetables, oily fish, fortified cereals and soups, and fortified foods like milk, yogurt and fortified juices. For adults aged 50 to 70 years, the Institute of Medicine recommends 600 International Units (IU) of vitamin D each day. Adults over 70 should take two 500-unit doses of vitamin D every other week.

Q: What happens when my blood levels of vitamin K exceed 30 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL)?

A: Your body produces too little of this vitamin when your diet contains plenty of calcium. So before you start taking a prescription drug or another form of vitamin K supplement, check with your doctor. Some drugs contain vitamin K while others don't. Vitamin K deficiency has been linked to heart failure, high cholesterol, osteoporosis, memory loss, arthritis, depression, seizures, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, migraines, kidney stones, blood clots and nerve damage. In addition to increased risks, taking vitamin K often results in side effects including headache, fatigue, pain, rash, bone pain, weight gain and acne. Talk to your doctor about whether your medications contain vitamin K.

Q: Why doesn't everyone get enough iron?

A: Iron helps our bodies absorb water, which makes us stronger. Too much iron in your system can cause anemia. Even moderate amounts can increase your risk of developing liver cancer, heart disease and certain cancers, including breast, lung and colon cancer. To prevent these diseases and illnesses, talk to your doctor about how many servings of fruits and vegetables and whole grains your family eats each day. Eating more red meat and dairy products may also raise your iron intake. Ask your doctor about any dietary changes",55,How to manage multiple sclerosis?,-11.242924690246582,218,q,5,0.8861788617886179,408,13

The Atkins Diet may not be healthy or even worthwhile. It is a highly restrictive dietary approach to losing weight. You have to adhere to such a strict and regimented diet every day - which may be very hard. Your body may reject many of your food choices because they taste bad and/or may not be filling. It can also make you feel weak and hungry at times. I believe that people who follow a strictly low calorie diet should be given a second chance once their health improves. However, the Atkins Diet is not an easy way to lose weight - it is very difficult to stick with a strictly controlled diet of only 5-6 meals per day for many weeks or months...and may not work at all, depending upon your own personal situation! [more details in my blog post here] In short, I recommend that anyone considering going on the Atkins Diet make sure that he/she takes into account his/her needs before proceeding; if you have no health problems, then go ahead.

Q: What was your diagnosis before you started treatment?

(a) Acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

(b) Mucosal atrophy with diffuse axonal loss.

(c) Multiple sclerosis (MS), which includes both primary and secondary forms.

(d) Neurological disorders that do not meet the definition of any of these conditions (see list below).

(e) Surgical or psychiatric diseases.

(f) A combination of any two of the following.

(2) A medical condition that causes the disease to be progressive or disabling.

(3) Any other medically determinable physical or mental impairment that interferes with a person's ability to perform at least some activities of daily living.

(g) Multiple sclerosis (MS), which is a chronic relapsing-remitting disease of central nervous system (CNS) origin that affects millions of people worldwide. This disease has no known cure. In most cases, it results in paralysis and/or weakness affecting 10 percent or more of each limb. It usually begins between ages 20 and 50. People may develop multiple sclerosis by accident, aging, infection, trauma, or injury; however, it is often triggered by an underlying immune disorder. About 1.8 million Americans are diagnosed with MS every year. The vast majority experience symptoms during their teens and early twenties. Those who do not have any symptoms tend to respond well to medication and surgery. For some, the onset occurs shortly after birth but others begin as young as age 5. There are several types of MS. Primary (non-reactive) MS is the most common type of MS, affecting about 80 percent of the population. Secondary (responsive) MS is characterized by milder forms of the disease, such as focal neurologic deficit, optic neuritis, spasticity, and tics.

Q: How many patients have been treated for MS?

There is currently only one FDA-approved therapy for MS. Oral sulindac, an oral formulation of levetiracetam, is approved as an adjunctive treatment for the treatment of moderate to severe relapses of MS and occasionally for refractory non-relapse MS.

Q: Is there any evidence for using pemoline in the treatment of MS?


Treatment with pemoline has been shown to have beneficial effects on several symptoms and outcomes of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) or primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). In an uncontrolled trial, oral administration of pemoline (0.5 mg/kg daily, administered once daily from day 0 to week 14) was shown to be associated with significant improvement in mood, cognitive function, sleep quality, pain scores, disability and overall disease progression in patients with RRMS and PPMS. Pemoline treatment also was found to significantly improve global functional status in both groups when compared to placebo in both RRMS and PPMS. For example, in one study, pemoline therapy resulted in significantly higher levels of positive mental status than did placebo in those with RRMS; however, this benefit was only seen in those who had already begun treatment before the start of pemoline therapy. Similarly, pemoline therapy led to improved depression symptomatology in those with PPMS. These results suggest that the combination of pemoline with other anti-inflammatory therapies may result in superior improvements over standard treatments in some cases of multiple sclerosis, which are currently available. The findings of these studies should prompt further investigation into the use of pemoline as a novel therapy for MS.


There is also strong evidence that pemoline can help reduce symptoms in people with HIV/AIDS. As pemoline reduces the inflammatory response to infection, it could be considered for use in treating HIV/AIDS patients suffering from relapses after initial treatment. However, the efficacy of pemoline in preventing new infections has not yet been established in human trials.


The benefits of pemoline therapy for MS include:


• Improved cognition and memory functions. Research has shown that pemoline helps patients regain lost brain function after stroke, and pemoline may also affect the neurotransmitter system by increasing the activity of acetylcholinesterase. Acetylcholine, the main neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, plays a role in maintaining normal cognitive functioning. Although pemoline does not increase acetylcholine release, its effect on memory appears to be similar to that of drugs such as piracetam, which acts on cholinergic neurons.


• Decreased fatigue. Several studies showed that pemoline reduced fatigue within 24 hours after",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-2.470329999923706,57,q,5,0.42857142857142855,375,7

The most important thing I've learned from this is that patients need to take their doctor's advice about what medications to use – not me, because it's never a good idea to be too aggressive with medications!

In fact, let's talk about one medication – Doxycycline. There are many studies on this drug, but I believe my main finding was from an article published in 2004 in Neurology. In it, Dr. Richard Dement noted that ""the most common side effect [of Doxycycline] has been gastrointestinal symptoms."" It turns out that when someone takes a lot of these drugs (especially those taken at high doses) they can actually make you feel worse when your stomach is full, and that may affect your ability to eat properly later in life. This is why we want to limit the amount of drugs we take – in fact, if doctors don't know how much to prescribe, they should ask themselves whether the patient needs them, before prescribing them.

I'll end this post by saying that you should always consult with a specialist before taking any new medical treatment – especially something that could potentially impact your memory and thinking skills, like a brain tumor, a blood clot in your brain, etc. If you have questions about how a specific medication will work on your body, speak with your doctor.

gpt2-large_116,"the prostate is a gland, and in men that produce hormones. Q: How can I reduce my risk of dying from prostate cancer? A: The most effective way to lower your risk of dying from prostate cancer is by having regular sexual intercourse (and not just anal sex) with an active male partner who has not yet had prostate surgery, a procedure known as castration. This will also help prevent prostate cancer from growing back if you are already infected or have one, or if you've been diagnosed with it. Q: What's the best type of pill to take for preventing breast cancer? A: While there is no single hormone pill that all women should use, many studies show that taking a combination pill containing estrogen plus progestin increases their chances of developing breast cancer compared to taking only one pill. When starting treatment, choose the one which seems most likely to work best. It may be possible to combine pills containing different hormones together if both are thought to be equally effective. However, combining these two pills does mean you'll get less benefit than if you were given the full range of hormones separately. Q: Do condoms protect against sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS? A: Most studies do not support this claim and suggest that condoms offer little protection against STDs. There are no official guidelines on how often people should use them and how frequently they must be used to guarantee complete protection. If someone has a low-risk sexual behaviour, like unprotected oral sex or risky vaginal sex, then using a condom might make them more vulnerable to infection. These precautions include always wearing a condom while changing clothes at home, washing your hands thoroughly before touching other body parts, and checking out any areas where you suspect someone may have recently passed away, especially those that smell particularly foul. Q: How can I tell whether my hairline or neck is getting thicker? A: Hairline and neck hair is usually thicker when it grows longer; however, it may appear thinner when it gets shorter. Generally speaking, it appears thicker during early puberty (when breasts tend to become bigger), but it tends to disappear over time until it starts to grow again after puberty ends. Skin around the area where your hairline or neck meets your head is usually thicker, but it may also start to thin as it matures into adulthood.

CJ: What is your opinion about the recent research on brain changes related to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)?


RK: My opinion is that CTE can be diagnosed through neuropathological examination using standard imaging techniques. However, some clinicians do not believe the findings from such tests constitute confirmation that this condition exists. The American Medical Association recognizes that this is true but does not endorse the clinical practice of declaring a diagnosis based solely on neuropathological exam results alone. If CTE is indeed the cause of an athlete's symptoms and disability, then the neuropathological evidence should establish its existence. It would seem reasonable that if this were proven, then many athletes would seek help so as to avoid having their brains examined to determine whether they might have CTE. In my experience, I've never seen any scientist advocate that a ""diagnosis"" of CTE by neuropathology alone was sufficient, given that the pathophysiology remains unclear. Some scientists argue that the neuropathological findings may merely reflect subtle differences between normal and pathological levels of TBI (toxic insult) that could be more easily identified with other diagnostic testing methods than neuropathological analysis alone. That said, it appears that there is an association between chronic exposure to repeated head trauma, particularly concussions, and the development of CTE.

Symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness, difficulty in breathing, coughing, chest pain, confusion, drowsiness, and fatigue.

A: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a chronic lung disorder that affects airways, causes the lungs to become more inflamed than normal, leading to pneumonia, bronchitis, emphysema, and other complications. It may also cause changes in the structure of the body's immune system. COPD affects approximately 10 million Americans annually with an average age of 60. The average life expectancy for people who have COPD is between 40 and 50 years.

B: lung cancer is the second most common form of cancer among all cancers in men and women aged 15 to 74 years old. Lung cancer accounts for 23% of all deaths from cancer worldwide. It is the second-leading cause of death from malignant neoplasms after prostate cancer. In 2010 there were about 30,000 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed each year in the United States. Among females, lung cancer is more prevalent than breast cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. About 19,700 lung cancer patients die from it every year.

C: lung cancer is one of the top three cancer killers in young adults ages 25–44 years old. While lung cancer remains the number one killer of these groups, men are still much more likely to be affected by the disease than women. For example, men age 55 and older account for nearly 70% of new cases of lung cancer diagnosed during 2005–2010. However, if you live in a county in which women outnumber men, your chance of being affected by this risk factor increases to over 90%.

D: lung cancer is the second deadliest type of cancer in both sexes. It occurs in more than 6% of all cancers diagnosed. As of January 2011, the mortality rate was almost 33,300 per 100,000 persons. Approximately 4% of lung cancer survivors will continue to develop it into their 80s or later; 1% of lung cancer patients will remain with it into their 80s or later. About 13% of those surviving from lung cancer will require chemotherapy treatment to cure the disease. Of these patients,",113,asthma and covid,-8.979850769042969,183,q,5,0.8356164383561644,382,6

Heavy flares are a sign of an underlying disease, usually of the lymphatic system. When the cancer has spread to nearby tissue and there's no treatment available, heavy flare can be life-threatening. Heavy flares occur more frequently in men than women, and they tend to happen when you're young or have been taking certain medications for a long time. They may not start until after your last period or just after getting a cold. If you see a significant increase in your symptoms (such as headache, fatigue, joint pain), speak to your doctor.

Treatment For Heavy Flares

Depending on your diagnosis, it may take up to six months before you begin any treatment. Your treatment plans will depend on how severe your flare is. Sometimes doctors use antiviral drugs to try to reduce the amount of inflammation, but other times they recommend surgery. The most common treatment options include:

Antivirals — these help prevent the cells from reacting with the virus. These medicines work by blocking the body's response to viruses. Antiviral therapy also can cause side effects like nausea and vomiting that affect quality of life.

Antiviral therapy also can cause side effects like nausea and vomiting that affect quality of life. Surgery — this surgery removes excess fluid, which helps lower blood pressure and decrease inflammation levels. This operation is often done under general anesthesia. It can only be performed if your condition can't be managed through regular medicine.

Dietary Tips\r


- Keep your meals light and fresh with reduced amounts of fruit and sugary drinks. This will keep you feeling full longer and keep hunger at bay. - Avoid foods that are processed and packaged. These foods contain ingredients such as preservatives or artificial colors and flavors. - Choose low-fat dairy products such as yogurt, cheese, cottage cheese, and ice cream. They provide good nutrition and can help lower cholesterol levels. - Limit saturated fats like those found in vegetable oils, margarine, and meat. Saturated fats cause inflammation and contribute to heart disease. Vegetable oil has been shown to be one of the best choices for healthy cholesterol levels. - Eat a variety of different types of fruits, including blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, apple, mangoes, peaches, apricots, prunes, grapefruit, cantaloupes, and watermelon. - Reduce refined carbohydrates. Fruits and veggies are packed with fiber that keeps them from being digested by the body. It also helps reduce the need for energy. - Don't go overboard on sweets and desserts. If you do eat too much, it's best not to stop until you feel full. As long as you stay within your daily calorie needs, you won't get hungry again. - Make sure you have plenty of rest between meals. A well-rested mind increases concentration, self-esteem, and self-confidence. When you're exhausted after eating, you tend to overeat later on. Try making small, frequent meals throughout the day instead of each meal. Try to limit yourself to one main meal per day to make up for lost calories. \r

gpt2-large_53,"""Psychology"" means the study of human behavior in social relationships, such as family, work or school. The word has a long history with English, having been used to describe the science of how we understand ourselves and others through observation and experience. It's no longer used by most dictionaries though, so I thought I'd use it here instead. This website was started for my sister. She was diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 12, but her symptoms were hard to detect because she'd been diagnosed early, when they weren't considered normal (a lot easier than diagnosing children).

There are links to articles about her and some links to other people with similar issues and also some support groups.

What should I expect from psychotherapy?\nA: Psychotherapy often involves helping a patient learn strategies that will help them cope with their feelings, thoughts and behaviors. Some patients may have problems with certain types of therapy; this does not mean there isn't anything else you can do for them. Just remember that you should always seek out good therapy, especially if you think it could benefit your child. For many parents, finding the right therapist can seem like a daunting task, but once you get started and get involved in learning the tools and techniques, things start to feel much more fun! Sometimes treatment works best when you're talking it over with the client first before making changes, and sometimes a change needs to happen immediately after your initial consultation. So make sure to go back several times and take notes on what you find useful and avoid giving advice based off assumptions or biased opinions. When making decisions regarding therapy, you'll want to ask yourself whether you can do something differently, not whether you think it would be better to just try something new. Also, keep in mind that any kind of therapy works well for some, some less so. Keep that in mind while deciding what type of therapeutic relationship to build with your child.",53,what is psychotherapy?,-1.2440438270568848,14,q,5,0.07777777777777778,362,5

Treatment[7][8] A combination of a high dose intravenous glucose solution followed by oral insulin has been shown to be the most effective treatment for patients with idiopathic hypersensitivity syndrome. It is recommended that all patients receiving this therapy have at least two independent stool samples collected every five days during their hospitalization period. This can be done using an alternative method of collection such as rectal swab examination or fecal testing.[9] The exact concentration of insulin administered should be adjusted according to patient response. Treatment duration varies from several hours to weeks depending on the severity of symptoms. Patients with mild reactions are often able to continue for longer periods while those with severe reactions require more frequent blood draws. If there is evidence of increased risk for complications in patients treated with insulin injections, then it may be advisable to discontinue treatment.[10][11]


Possible Side Effects[12] Allergic Reactions - Inflammation of the lining of the intestines, especially around the jejunum and inside the colon; also known as peritonitis and endocarditis. [13] It usually resolves within a few days but may take longer depending upon the nature of the infection or underlying medical condition. These inflammatory changes can affect the gastrointestinal tract or liver and can cause abdominal pain and jaundice. [14] Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)[15] - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), include Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and other intestinal disorders like IBS. There are many different forms including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Crohn's disease is considered to be the leading type of IBD and its causes include bacteria from the GI tracts. Ulcers and ulcerative colitis are also caused by bacteria from the GI tract. Symptoms include cramps, bleeding, swelling and tenderness. Some cases lead to loss of function in various organs such as the liver and spleen. In rare cases, people who develop ulcers might lose the ability to digest food. They can also suffer from weight loss and fatigue. Chronic inflammation of the intestine and colon can be part of the pathogenesis of these conditions. These types of diseases tend to go away once antibiotics are started to treat the underlying issue(",108,chronic diarrhea short-term memory sweating inability to regulate body temperature heart palpitations dysautonomia,-9.15280818939209,29,q,5,0.4915254237288136,376,11

What was your favourite part of The Walking Dead and why?\n

The Walking Dead's storyline has been outstanding from start to finish. It always seems like there will be some big twist or reveal that gets everyone talking about the next episode, which makes you feel even more excited to watch. I have a lot of respect for Rick Grimes and his character in particular, as he constantly challenges himself mentally and physically. However, if my son had been alive when the first season started, he would've also been involved in the same kind of story line, but perhaps not in the same way.\r


\r

How did you come up with the name ""The Governor""?\r

My wife called me one day while we were watching television and asked what I wanted my new job title to be. She said that the governor (a real person) used to refer to a town without electricity. To her surprise, she didn't think I'd actually want to work in that kind of environment. At the time, I thought about how great it would be to have an office/room where people could just walk around and talk freely. So when my friend told me the title, I immediately thought of the show. After a few days of searching on Google, I found out the governor is named after Abraham Lincoln. When I realized the connection between the two names, I knew exactly what I should call myself.\r


\r

Is there anything else you would like to add?\r

I love being able to bring so many different kinds of characters together into such a compelling narrative, and I'm proud of every single one of them who works hard to make their unique presence felt in each episode. For those who don't know me yet, let me say that I can easily be recognized by the fact that I wear glasses. However, I wouldn't worry too much about it as I always try to keep my eyes open for any signs of danger or emergencies.\r

My doctor suggested to take a prescription from a medical book and I went ahead and did that, and got myself a few pills. When I woke up, the doctor told me that I need to see an orthopedic surgeon. He said he would call me within 24 hours. It turned out that he had called the doctor a couple days earlier and asked him about the pills I took (which were probably just for anxiety), but it turns out that these pills caused my chest wall to tighten up causing swelling, and because of that, the doctor is now saying it was time to get me tested for STDs.

gpt2-large_112,"A.F./I/R/E.P.S.: Allergies are treated with steroids, and sometimes a combination of medications. The best way to determine if your child has asthma is by asking them to stand in front of the mirror or close their eyes while they breathe into a sealed airway. If it smells bad or something is coming out of their nose, take them back to their doctor. There are many different types of asthma that affect kids. It may be bronchial, chronic, or food-related asthma (food allergies). In most cases, they will respond to an inhaled corticosteroid, but they will also respond to oral medications for short periods of time (up to five days) as well. Most children get better after the first dose of an inhaler. For more information on what you should do, visit the American Academy of Pediatrics website.

Asthma treatment can cause side effects which can include headaches, dizziness, sleep problems, increased appetite, depression, nausea, difficulty breathing, coughing up blood, and even death. These potential complications are very real. While these symptoms are usually mild and resolve within weeks of stopping treatment, there can be long-lasting changes in health that are not reversible. Therefore, the decision about whether or not to continue treatment depends on your child's overall condition, age, and activity level. Consult with a pediatrician before making any major decisions about your child's health.

What causes Asthma?

Inhalation asthma occurs when the lining of the lungs becomes inflamed, causing congestion. The body produces mucus, which helps regulate breathing. When this mucus builds up over time and becomes thickened, it becomes difficult to clear from the lungs because it clogs the airways and blocks them completely. Once blocked, the lungs cannot expand as much and the patient will become unresponsive. Symptoms include wheezing, cough, runny nose, and chest tightness. Children who live in areas where airborne pollutants and toxins are higher than average have a greater risk of developing asthma. This includes tobacco smoke, mold, pesticides, and other chemicals found in homes and workplaces.

Food allergy is another common type of asthmatic disease. It occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the small intestine during digestion or absorption of foods. This leads to swelling of the intestines. This happens in some people due to certain foods such as peanuts, eggs, soybeans, wheat, shellfish, fish, and nuts. Other symptoms could include",112,symptoms of asthma,-1.3200500011444092,32,q,6,0.1523809523809524,390,21

What is radiation? \r

Radiation is an external (electromagnetic) force applied to the body in order to change one chemical state (a radioactive substance) into another. It does not harm the body. However, there are a variety of things that occur when radiation damages DNA, and these effects can cause certain cancers to develop. Radiation causes various types of changes to cells in your body through different routes, including from nuclear power plants, medical devices, chemicals used in diagnostic procedures, and sunlight exposure. As well as causing damage to DNA, radiation can also affect your immune system. When this occurs, some people will become more susceptible to other kinds of disease such as diabetes. While there are no known health risks associated with radiation, there are still factors that you should consider when deciding whether to expose yourself to it. For example, if you already have a high risk of developing a particular type of cancer because of previous exposure to radiation, you may want to think twice about exposing yourself to more radiation. This depends on what kind of cancer you're interested in having treated, how much time has passed since your last radiation treatment, and any risks that might arise. There's an array of different ways you can get rid of radiation that doesn't actually do anything harmful to you (for example, by using radio-frequency radiation), so you'll need to look carefully at each option before making your choice. See Cancer Treatment Guide \r

But I also worry about other people who don't think they can or should do this kind of thing for themselves. Some people may not want to admit that they're disabled, so we need to talk about it more openly now, especially if you're doing something that really feels right -- making the leap from being disabled to working, which is what some people may decide to do once they get off the couch. Q: do you see yourself taking up another disability, such as depression? \nA: I've been thinking about depression and having a professional look into whether I'm depressed enough to be qualified for the job. \nBut for me, I'd rather take a job where there are other people who are disabled and happy, and have those jobs than one where everyone has to deal with depression all the time. And then you know, there's a part of me that wants to try things like that for myself. As long as it doesn't come down to depression, and we can figure out ways of making the workplace more inclusive for everyone, I'll keep trying. Q: What advice would you give someone who had tried a similar course of action before but found their life got worse? How could they make sure they weren't falling through the cracks when it comes to getting hired in the future? \nA: It depends, really. If it's a job that you enjoy, and you feel that there aren't many people around who are like you anyway, you might just continue doing your own thing until you find something better that pays better or gives you more control over your life. But if you're feeling stressed about your job, about what you're putting into it, and about the way it affects others, you might consider looking into other careers. When I first started my career in medicine, I went to school to study psychiatry. But then I took two years out so that I could get my master's degree and get involved in research, which is much more exciting than studying an obscure topic like psychiatry.

gpt2-large_97,"the general concept is that the more you move, and the longer you do it, the better your health will be. You might not know this from the fitness magazines or commercials but a variety of studies have found this to be true for most people (at least in the short term). For example, one study showed that as many as 85% of sedentary people could improve their cardiovascular disease risk factors by participating in regular exercise, even after they stopped smoking. However, there are some caveats with these types of studies (e.g., participants are generally healthy enough to participate), so it's possible that other factors also play an important role.

Q: what about all the research showing that physical activity does help prevent heart attacks and strokes? A: The evidence suggests that physical activity reduces the incidence of both cardiovascular disease and sudden death, but these effects may vary between individuals. For example, physical inactivity has been associated with increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) and stroke, but some studies suggest no association at all for mortality [13]. It seems likely that some of this effect is due to chance; but given the prevalence of obesity in America, which puts additional stress on existing arteries, the fact remains that physical inactivity is still dangerous for all people regardless of whether they're overweight or obese.

Q: I've heard that physical activity can reduce your risk of developing dementia! A: This was another common misconception about physical inactivity. In addition to helping prevent cardiovascular diseases and deaths related to them, moderate-intensity aerobic training has been shown to protect against cognitive decline in older adults [14], suggesting a potential benefit in preventing dementia among those who aren't yet old enough to develop it. If you find yourself experiencing mild to severe memory loss that hasn't improved since you started exercising regularly, seek professional advice if necessary.

A: Yes, one of the first questions you will ask after meeting them is whether they are healthy enough and if they were able to get rid of their bad posture. After that you should also inquire about their health condition with specific reference to the patient's age and sex. (Note: if it does not make sense then just don't ask). Q: I am currently working on improving my posture but I do not know how to go about doing this? How can I get started? A: You can start by visiting a physiotherapist. They will help you get your posture in order so that you become more active. Ask for a referral from a doctor as well. If there isn't a doctor near you then check here. The following list covers some common medical issues that people might encounter. It doesn't cover all possible situations but it might be helpful to know what may happen if you experience these types of problems. Q: What is the most important thing to remember when practicing yoga? A: Be patient. Most of us spend our whole lives being irritated by sitting too much or too little - and we have no idea why. Being patient means taking time each day to practice. Even though you may feel like you are having trouble getting into position, you shouldn't give up completely. Just continue trying until you succeed. Also, try to focus your attention on the physical sensations you are experiencing rather than your mind. We believe that keeping your head still makes you less likely to make mistakes while looking at something else. In fact, the more relaxed you seem the less likely you are to make mistakes. Another way to keep yourself on track is to sit comfortably, hold onto your chair/saddle for support, keep a cool breeze blowing against your back, etc. These simple things can help prevent errors. Q: Does yoga pose really increase blood flow? A: Not necessarily! Studies have shown that different poses such as forward bends, twists, lunges and hip thrusts may actually decrease blood flow to your extremities. Since blood circulates throughout your body we need to maintain proper circulation within our limbs. In other words, we need to avoid being in an awkward position where the skin and muscle tissue are exposed and where we cannot receive adequate oxygen.

FMS-A

Question: What is FMS-A?\nA: The condition is inflammation of the small intestine caused by infection with bacteria such as Escherichia coli, E. Coli or Salmonella. It has no known cause but there have been several theories put forth. Many people believe it's linked to food poisoning because the gut becomes inflamed from eating raw eggs, oysters or other foods which contain the bacterium. Others say it is caused by certain medications taken by an infected person. Others say this type of intestinal illness may be related to obesity or diabetes. Regardless, many doctors don't think this form of gastrointestinal illness exists.

FMS-B

Question: How long does it take for MS-A to progress into fibromyalgia and how do they differ?\nA: MS-A has a very short duration (two to four years). Once it starts progressing, MS-A is extremely painful. It usually causes extreme fatigue and a feeling of emptiness. It can also make it difficult to concentrate. People who are having MS-A often describe it as being like having a ""pins and needles"" sensation, where their body feels like it's trying to escape itself. MS-B is more insidious and progresses quickly. There are many different types of FMS-B. They all seem to affect similar people and symptoms. Some patients report they experience severe pain during periods of the day when they're not engaged in activities, while others feel numbness in their limbs at night. For most people, they only develop these effects after many months. Other factors associated with FMS-B include chronic stress, low blood sugar levels and excessive exercise. Doctors generally recommend taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to help reduce inflammation, if possible.

Babies born to women who smoke during pregnancy are more likely than the general population to have a range of health problems such as:

abnormal lung development (pneumonia)

a higher risk of premature birth

severe respiratory infections and allergic reactions

coughing up blood

a lower chance for successful labour

difficulty breathing or swallowing

breast enlargement or swelling

high blood pressure

an increased likelihood of low birth weight

increased risk of death from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

How can I prevent my baby smoking?

Smoking during pregnancy is one of many risks pregnant women face each day. The World Health Organisation recommends that women should not smoke in the first trimester unless they plan on taking it up again throughout their lives, while still avoiding high-risk activities. This includes:

at least six hours a day

not smoking in public places, including bars and restaurants

in areas with children around you

using your phone whilst driving or otherwise being exposed to second hand smoke

smoking indoors

making and eating food containing tobacco products

eating out frequently.

To help protect yourself against secondhand smoke, use an indoor air purifier when sleeping; wear a mask if you're outside

use filters to keep cigarettes away from children, pets and neighbours. If you live in a building, make sure all windows are tightly closed. Don't let anyone else in, especially young people

keep your home clean

avoid playing loud music loudly.

Inflammatory cytokines and other factors are responsible for the accumulation of amyloid proteins and their accumulation in the brain. Treatment of various inflammatory disorders including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, fibromyalgia and inflammatory bowel diseases reduce the production of amyloids and protect against neuronal loss induced by Alzheimer's disease.

Q: Why do employers need to investigate if an employee has a psychological problem (or has had one)? A: In general, a person's employment status does not affect his/her ability to obtain treatment for psychological issues. However, it is important to know whether an individual poses any threat to the company and to take steps to protect the safety of others. It is also critical to determine the reason behind the person's behavior, which may involve making changes in how he/she interacts with employees. For example, if someone is upset over losing a job, it would be inappropriate for you to inquire about the reasons why. Such inquiries could lead to further questions regarding your own personal life and possibly reveal a possible personal issue. Employers must follow all applicable laws and regulations to ensure safety at work. When there is a risk that you will suffer harm because of the presence of psychological disorders, or a personality disorder, it is a good idea to seek professional help from a licensed psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, or other qualified professional to evaluate the nature of your symptoms and determine whether you have a serious emotional or behavioral disorder. \r

Q: What kind of evidence do I require? How long does the investigation process last? A: An employer must make a formal decision to hire or discharge someone based on the results of a psychiatric evaluation within 30 days after receiving written notice of such termination. If you don't receive this notification before the end of the thirty-day period, you must notify us in writing no later than three business days prior to terminating employment. No formal decision may be made until all reasonable efforts to reach agreement have been exhausted. We ask for documentation of the initial request for an appointment, including a copy of the letter requesting an evaluation, as well as the name of the physician/psychiatrist who performed the evaluation and copies of medical records relevant to the diagnosis and treatment.

Healthy people are able to live long, healthy lives, and this is achievable through a range of complementary and alternative medicines that may help address certain conditions. In addition, some complementary medicine therapies may have an impact on chronic diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes. These therapies may also improve the quality of life for patients with depression or other mood disorders. In addition, they may lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels. As part of their treatment, many complementary medicines may prevent certain types of cancer, such as breast, bowel and prostate cancers, cervical cancer, ovarian and pancreatic cancer, as well as skin and eye diseases. Many of these treatments are also effective at treating other medical conditions.

gpt2-large_114,"Yes, most of them can be managed by appropriate psychotherapy. Q: how often do they occur? A: very rarely and less frequently than in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder

When Does It Occur?

How often does it happen? That's the question. Usually it happens once a month to 2-3 times per year for the first couple years (this is called 'overlap'), then more frequent during adolescence (up to every 3 months). For example, if you have paranoid thought that someone is following you or has followed you before, that will definitely trigger your paranoid thought episodes. They may start as soon as you see someone, but there are some exceptions. This might help you understand what's happening.

The Symptoms

PTSD is usually seen in teenagers, so this is an important part of understanding why teenagers suffer from it. You may notice that their behaviour seems odd at first. The problem is that a lot of these kids were treated like crazy people who just didn't know any better; as if they couldn't distinguish right from wrong. But over time, the diagnosis becomes clear. If you read about it on the internet, you'll find that many of them experienced hallucinations, delusions and depersonalisation – all of which contribute to your paranoia feeling increasingly real. You're not thinking clearly anymore, and you're doubting everything. Your sense of reality feels distorted, so you tend to exaggerate things. There are lots of other symptoms too, such as: being able to remember nothing for hours, remembering things without looking at them, having trouble focusing on long conversations, imagining that the world around you is moving, being unable to concentrate on anything for an extended period, and difficulty making decisions. In fact, in research studies it was found that adolescents with PTSD report much greater emotional distress after each episode of psychosis, and that they are twice as likely to experience suicidal thoughts. What's more, depression is one of the main risk factors for suicide in adults.

What Can Be Done About It?

If you think you've been affected, talk to your GP/psychiatrist and get a complete medical history. These are probably the easiest ways to figure out if something is going on. If you suspect there's a link, make sure you speak to somebody as soon as possible.

In addition to using an ergonomic chair to support your spine, it's important to watch out for other potential causes of spinal stenosis, such as arthritis, trauma, surgery or degenerative disc disease (such as diabetes). If you suspect spinal stenosis, speak with your health care provider so he or she can examine your spine to identify any possible root cause. Treatment options include medication and physical therapy.

You can safely use different types of medicines at the same time—for example, you could start taking one medicine and then switch back when you're feeling well again. Also, even though there are different drugs available over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription (PCP) medications, they usually interact differently; thus, it's critical to know which medications you need to be careful when using them together.

I've had this same problem with Win7/8 and Vista too (Windows 8.1). I have tried various things such as cleaning and reinstalling all the applications, trying different versions of windows, changing operating systems etc... but nothing worked. The only thing which did seemed to work was to install the latest version of Win 7 (not sure about Vista) and restarted after installing it. The next day I went back to the original error message (Windows Error 0x80071300) and read through the ""To do"" section on the Help tab again. That made sense now. I am pretty sure the message was written by someone who knew the system very well so he could guess what could cause this. So after reading through it again I decided to try one last thing and see if anything helped. This time I installed the latest version of the OS. What happened was the error message disappeared but when I rebooted it showed again (but not for 2 seconds or so). After booting again the new message shows the original error from before and then it comes back and says something like ""No such file or directory"". Then it freezes. When I look at the date, the date changed to Oct 11 2010. I've never seen this happen before. What should I do? [The problem continues...]

3. In order to understand this definition, note that the word ""fear"" has two distinct meanings: 1) a sense of fear (as opposed to terror), and 2) an emotion related to danger or discomfort. The first meaning is frequently used when referring to physical fears. For example, a person may be afraid he will fall down the stairs. His fear is not due to his lack of strength but rather because he cannot reach the top. When a person is experiencing an emotional state of anxiety, such as fear of heights, we use the second meaning of the word fear. However, you can also say that someone is fearful for some other reason than their own physical strength. A person who is frightened by the prospect of flying at high speed is still afraid of falling, even if he does eventually make it to the ground. A person whose heart rate is racing to beat faster than normal after eating something spicy is still terrified by the thought of what might happen to him if he eats too much spicy food. You should know how important it is to remember which meaning of the word fear is being employed. It is important to keep in mind that there are other emotions associated with fear that do not directly relate to one's physical ability. Fear is just another kind of emotion that can have its roots in many different places within our bodies. There are several more common ones than those I mentioned above: 1. A sense of threat, danger, or annoyance. A person can become tense and uncomfortable when he feels threatened or annoyed. He often experiences tension in his chest when the subject of his concern comes up. This is called feeling a threat and may be accompanied by a trembling or shaking sensation. 2. An emotion related to apprehension (a feeling of impending doom). Often referred to as a phobia or panic disorder. A person who is prone to fear things like snakes, spiders, and fire may experience intense dread while thinking about them. 3. A feeling of insecurity or inadequacy. A person can feel insecure and inadequate as a result of physical limitations or disabilities. 4. Stress that arises out of circumstances beyond the individual's control. These include illness, financial problems, and others outside the control of the person themselves. 5. A state of panic, nervousness, and/or distress. 6. A feeling that something or someone is causing trouble. 7. A strong desire",92,causes of fatigue in MS,-13.485735893249512,197,q,6,0.8794642857142857,436,23

Q: How do you know when your body has reached its tolerance?

A: We've been able to measure this by looking at how long our bodies take to respond to an increase in insulin levels. When we see a steady rise over a period of about four weeks, we're good to go. But if we start out with no response at all, we need to keep on monitoring, and eventually we'll get the full benefit of the high-sugar diet.

Q: What are the risks?

A: The most common thing with these diets is weight gain. A lot of people lose a great deal of their muscle mass as they go through the ketogenic phase – and this means that they end up eating too little calories and getting fat instead of lean. But that doesn't always happen. Some people manage to regain some of the lost muscle while maintaining their lower body mass. People who have been taking a low carb diet may also experience loss of their hair or nails, but this isn't usually noticeable during the first few months of following the diet.

Q: What's the best way to stay healthy during the ketogenic phase?

A: In the past, we used to encourage people to avoid exercise until they were ready. Now we generally recommend that everybody follow a moderate amount of moderate intensity exercise during the ketogenic diet. This will help maintain the natural hormones that regulate metabolism and help prevent the build up of triglycerides. It will also help fight hunger so that people are less likely to overeat.

Q: What is a ""cytokine""? A: Cytokines are proteins which act as messengers, and their primary function is to regulate cell activity, repair tissue damage or promote healing. Cytokines are found in the body and they may be released by cells when they are damaged, stressed, or activated (for example, during an infection). The word cyto is Greek for ""one"" and it's used to describe the cellular type of the substance.


Cytokines also help regulate immune system responses, and contribute to immune response and disease pathogenesis, so many people with MS experience inflammation in the brain. This is why some people develop fatigue, pain, weakness, and loss of memory, vision and hearing. Other causes of CNS inflammation include infections, bacterial infection, HIV/AIDS, viral infections such as pneumonia, herpes, and other viruses, and tumors.",68,List of multiple sclerosis symptoms,-7.992806911468506,139,q,6,0.6289592760180995,142,4

4-Fluoroacetate (3G) (also known as 3G phosphate or 3G/phosphatidylserine) is a synthetic analog of 5-fluorouracil that has been shown to have significant immunomodulatory properties in various immune mediated diseases including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus and Crohn's disease. It can be used to treat many different types of autoimmune diseases. This compound was originally developed by Drs. T.C. Martin of the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), Michael E. Smith of UC Berkeley, and Gert Schultes at Ludwig-Maximilians Universität Munich, Germany.

5- Fluorouracil (also known as 5-Fluorouracil or 5F) is an agent derived from a synthetic derivative of sodium fluoride which has a very high affinity for the 5-fluorouracil receptor, a critical component of the innate immune response to bacterial antigens found on cells and tissues of the body. The 5-fluorouracil receptor protein is expressed on glial cells and other tissues in the central nervous system.

6- Fluorescein is an ionic dye which forms blue light when exposed to oxygen, and red light when exposed to hydrogen peroxide. It can be easily absorbed into living tissue and released back upon exposure to air.

7- Folic acid is a naturally occurring vitamin B12 molecule. Its natural form is folic acid ethoxydase. The only way to synthesize folic acid is through a process called deiodination. Deiodination converts folic acid into its more biologically active form, folinic acid. The most commonly used forms are folic acid methyl ester and folic acid methyltaurate. These forms of folic acid are classified according to their molecular weights.

Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS): A type of inflammatory demyelinating disease with a similar appearance and symptoms, though this one affects the brain more than the spinal cord. It can lead to paralysis on the right side of the body and numbness in the feet and hands. SPMS may also cause hearing loss, memory problems, blurred vision, fatigue, muscle pain, headaches, joint and nerve damage, irritability, depression and other changes in mood and behavior.

SSA1: A type of autoimmune arthritis that causes inflammation in an area outside the joints, causing temporary swelling and redness. This leads to stiffness or spasms in the affected part of the body. There are three subtypes.

SSA2: SSA2 occurs when there's an abnormal pattern of new scar tissue forming inside existing blood vessels, like it happens in gangrene. SSA2 is sometimes found in people who have had strokes or traumatic injuries. SSA2 is often followed by SSA3, which isn't as severe but still affects some joints.

SPMS: The most common form of SSA2; the most common signs include numbness in the feet and legs, joint pain and swelling in the muscles, particularly the knees, hips, ankles, elbows and wrists, and a rash that can appear anywhere on the body. Sometimes SSA2 appears alone or with another type of SSA2 syndrome, such as SSA1. People with SSA2 have trouble walking, eating and sleeping, and they're at increased risk for certain types of cancer.

T-cell lymphomas (TBLS): These rare cancers occur during childhood in children who get infections from streptococcus bacteria. When adults carry these bacteria, their immune systems attack them. T-cell leukemia causes only a few cases per year in adults, but it's possible for TBLS to develop into TBLS.

Unusual skin reactions

These are not illnesses you should worry about if you don't know what causes them. However, you need to take care of yourself before experiencing any unusual skin reaction. If you experience one of the following, see your doctor immediately:

swelling or redness on the face or neck

bleeding gums, lips or tongue

gpt2-large_93,"No. There is no evidence that MS is a sleep disorder. Many people believe MS is related to difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, but this has been refuted by studies showing that sleep apnea does not affect the rate of progression from active to mild disability in MS patients, and that there are numerous studies that demonstrate that MS patients with major depression have normal circadian rhythms. \r


MS patients also tend to be more irritable than non-MS patients, and may have significant difficulties with memory recall. For example, one study of 20 people with severe chronic fatigue syndrome found that those who were irritable had poorer memory performance than those who were calm.[8] Sleep disturbances can play an important role in MS. A recent meta-analysis of 25 previous studies concluded that the prevalence of poor sleep (including insomnia) was at least twice as high in MS compared to healthy controls.[9] \r


However, research suggests that if you experience any symptoms such as insomnia or daytime fatigue while taking medications for MS, it is likely because these drugs interfere with REM sleep. The best way to avoid adverse effects and improve quality of life, then, is to take them regularly throughout the day. This includes taking them on an empty stomach before bedtime or avoiding caffeine after 8pm or 9pm. These two practices should help prevent or reduce any potential side effects of prescribed medications. \r


Finally, do not feel pressured into having a regular sleeping schedule for your illness; just like everyone else, your illness will dictate what time you wake up each night. If it's 3am on Saturday, you might want to stay up until 5am. If it's Sunday morning, you might get up earlier to catch the bus home. What works for you is entirely dependent on how you're feeling at that particular point in time, so keep in mind that some things might seem better at certain times of the day. It may even benefit some people to change their routines slightly when they've already taken medication for MS to reduce side effects and ensure adequate sleep. However, in most cases this isn't necessary, and we recommend that all MS patients consider how their sleep habits work best for them.

In the absence of evidence of progression in the setting where there is no disease stage \/ (eg if a man does not develop a clinical stage IIa prostate cancer but only shows an early-stage one and then dies from it) then they will say ""no progress."" But you're right that ""it's about time we had a more comprehensive approach"" when that comes. What I'm trying to get at here is just what kind of data we want. If we need 100 cases with no progression for every case with >4% progression, are we going to make it so that all the new prostate cancers that come out every year are going to show up? Are we going to do that? My opinion would be no, because those new cancers don't come back after 6 years so we know how many we've gotten. In fact, those new cancers actually go away in 20% of them (and some of them stay around). We don't really care. So what we want is the best available information that can tell us, yes, this patient did have a very high risk, yes, he did have a borderline risk, but in addition, we also need to know what his baseline risk was; what were the previous stages of the disease and how did that compare to the current ones? The reason why I think we may have missed this opportunity is that we don't really understand the biology of advanced prostate cancer -- we've got good ideas about that, but there are still questions like ""how much cell death did the tumor undergo before it metastasized?"" ""did it grow for months before getting into the blood stream?"" ""was there a local immune response?"" etc., etc. The basic idea seems to be that there aren't any really solid answers. There are good reasons to believe that the number of cancers we're finding in men who have been diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer may be even higher than that. Because we have no idea how many cancers we're seeing, we must therefore use our best guess as to what proportion of these cases represent true disease. This means that if we find 80 cases of advanced prostate cancer and 10 of those have metastatic disease, we'll say something like this: 70 cases of advanced prostate cancer and 10 with metastasis

gpt2-large_96,"if they don't eat for their weight\nNot all people with diabetes will be able to maintain a healthy diet, but those that do may experience some positive results. This article is aimed at helping the reader understand what constitutes a healthy diet and how one can create their own personalized plan of action.

Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by an inability to regulate blood sugar levels properly. It affects up to 30% of people who are overweight or obese.[1] The main risk factors include obesity, excess body fat, poor dietary habits, genetics, and certain medications used to treat diseases like cancer, multiple sclerosis, and high cholesterol.[2][3][4][5][6] Many people with Type 1 Diabetes require insulin injections to manage blood glucose levels and are unable to control it on their own without medication. If the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, then blood sugar spikes occur which leads to severe hypoglycemia and even death.[7] Individuals with type 2 diabetes have more frequent episodes of low blood sugar, as well as having a higher chance of experiencing adverse health outcomes such as stroke and heart attack. People diagnosed with pre-diabetes (type 2) have less serious issues in managing their blood sugars because they generally do better in controlling them on their own than those suffering from Type 1, though they still have to take insulin injections as needed to ensure optimal hormone production and maintenance. It is thought that when you are diagnosed with a disease affecting your organs, it takes longer for the symptoms to emerge. That means that when someone is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, he/she usually feels sick during the first year after diagnosis, sometimes causing stress and depression. However, once this happens, many individuals feel so much healthier and have fewer long term negative health effects than those with other types of diabetes.[8][9] For the rest of this article I am focusing on a very specific scenario – a person with Type 2 diabetes who decides to lose weight by losing about 10% of his/her body weight over six months. As soon as the weight loss begins, diabetics often experience a dramatic drop in their blood sugar. After three weeks the typical blood glucose level drops below 80 mg/dL, although it can fluctuate wildly.[10] By week four, the average blood glucose level has dropped down to 70 mg/dl. Even though this is impressive, it's important to note that not everyone has the same degree of success in losing weight by reducing weight and gaining muscle mass. Some people achieve significant reductions in",96,most efficient and sustainable diets,-12.043723106384276,32,q,6,0.35555555555555557,425,10

CBT is generally regarded as having helped hundreds of thousands of people worldwide - from the UK to South Africa. But there are many other forms of therapy which have been developed in recent years, and they differ in how effective they may be at treating specific types of depression and anxiety disorders. For example, there are mindfulness-based therapies that work with the mind rather than the emotions, whereas others offer more immediate relief but don't involve any sort of learning or skills.

But if you're not happy in life then you'll probably need some help for whatever reason, and so I'm here to tell you about one method of dealing with your problems and to let you know when and where to find out more.

There is no pressure to go along or anything. As well as talking about your worries and needs, you can also discuss things such as personal growth, financial issues, relationships, family problems and mental health challenges. It is often quite easy to find someone who shares your interest in the subject, as long as they are available and willing to talk about their own experiences with depression or anxiety. \nIf there is anyone else you would like me to introduce you to, please do call me up.

Why does it happen? Depression and anxiety usually start because something has happened in your life that makes you unhappy.

I'm in the middle of a severe outbreak of botulism, but I've been eating foods that are safe for me to eat. How do I prevent myself from developing the same symptoms?

A: A recent article published by New York Times Health columnist David Katzmayer noted that the food you are consuming is ""not necessarily what's causing your symptoms."" He goes on to say that there may be more than one factor at play, including factors like age, gender and health history. If you suspect your symptoms are related to a toxin and have not yet visited a doctor, it may help to consult with your allergist to determine if an alternative food source might be acceptable. You can also find information about alternative sources of protein, such as legumes, dairy products, nuts and seeds, or even nutritional supplements. The bottom line is that while it doesn't hurt to limit yourself from consuming certain types of food, avoiding any food group will almost certainly increase your chances of being healthy and avoidable complications. For example, some people who suffer from fibromyalgia report that they often get flu-like symptoms when they consume gluten-free pasta or breads. This can lead them to stop drinking milk because their stomachs become upset after drinking it. In this case, the problem isn't actually the gluten itself; instead, the acidity of the milk contributes to the discomfort. But if the acidity of the milk keeps you feeling ill, then it seems wise to cut out the milk entirely—at least temporarily. This type of advice is best used only when both the cause and cure seem reasonable and your symptoms remain manageable.

Can I make my own probiotic pills? Are these safe for children and pregnant women?

A: While some parents use probiotics (usually yogurt) for the prevention of diseases like bacterial infections and yeast overgrowth in the gut, it is important to note that they aren't good for anyone other than those with the right microbes. Some experts suggest using different kinds of probiotics depending on whether you're trying to lower your risk of allergies, constipation or lactose intolerance. According to Dr. Peter Attia, M.D., a gastroenterologist at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City, a good strategy is to take probiotics on an empty stomach.

Diabetes is not curable. It will always be with you. \r

As long as our bodies are in good condition they can survive on very little glucose (glucose from fat or alcohol). If your blood sugar exceeds 150 mg/dl you may need extra insulin therapy to keep it under control. You must also avoid high-fat foods such as bacon and red meat and limit processed sugars.\r

You cannot expect to make improvements overnight. This is why it is important to take regular blood tests. Your doctor may prescribe special diets for those who have had type 2 diabetes. They should aim to reduce their calorie intake by 50% over two months. For those who do not respond quickly enough or are unable to manage their own weight then dieting alone can lead to even more weight gain, particularly if calories are restricted severely. People at risk of becoming overweight should avoid eating large amounts of food which contains high levels of fats, salt and carbohydrates and have other healthy dietary habits.\r

For many people, diabetes becomes worse during pregnancy. Diabetes affects the development of the placenta and the growth of babies; therefore, there are risks associated with diabetes during pregnancy. Women with gestational diabetes should avoid having any kind of physical activity before or after delivery unless absolutely necessary. In this case, it would be wise to stay away from fast foods or alcohol until the baby is born. Any pregnant women who suffer from type 1 diabetes should watch closely for signs of low blood sugar and consult their GP. For men, treatment with oral medications may help some people with their symptoms but there are no effective treatments available for diabetics in general. Many people living with diabetes become so sick that they feel hopeless when they try to lose weight. There are simple things that can be done to maintain a normal weight. The healthiest way to eat is to eat a balanced diet containing plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and beans. Avoid refined starches and fillings in all forms, including dairy products, gluten free breads, biscuits and pasta. Eat lots of lean protein, unsaturated fats and fish. Vegetarians should choose a wide range of non-dairy sources of protein like pulses, nuts, seeds and legumes. Fruits and vegetables also contain fibre, essential vitamins and minerals.

What is asthma?

The lungs are the main organ that breathe oxygen and carbon dioxide into the body. People with allergies have a type of immune system called the ""allergic"" response which responds by producing substances known as immunoglobulins. These antibodies can cause an allergic reaction when they come into contact with certain substances. For example, if someone's saliva gets onto a piece of clothing containing allergens, it might make them itch. The itchiness may last for days or weeks after washing off. Some people find their skin itching even more if they smell foods, such as peanut butter and dairy products, during allergy season. Asthma is usually not serious but some people experience shortness of breath or breathing problems. If you have asthma, your doctor will need to check out your symptoms every few months and may prescribe medication to help control your condition. It could also mean that you get lots of tests.

Symptoms of asthma

Asthma occurs most often in children. However, adults with asthma may also develop this condition. Although there are no specific signs or symptoms, people who have asthma may complain about breathing difficulties including wheezing or coughing, difficulty breathing, sore throat or chest tightness, chest pain, shortness of breath or shortness of breath at rest or while standing up.

How do I know what kind of asthma my child has?

Your child should see his/her GP (general practitioner) within 21 days of being diagnosed with an asthma attack. An asthma attack can happen at any time of the year so it is important to check with your GP before going on holiday or going on holidays. You'll probably only be asked about a child's recent asthma attack, rather than whether your child had one in the past. In addition, an attack isn't always obvious, so your GP may ask to see photos or videos to show how an attack feels. Your child won't usually tell you anything about the attack itself.

If your child hasn't had an attack recently, he/she will likely be asked to keep records of his/her symptoms and any special circumstances you think may be causing them. An asthma attack may look similar to other types of attacks but will often differ from what someone else experiences. For example, someone with hayfever may cough or sne",112,symptoms of asthma,-0.1512020081281662,4,q,7,0.01904761904761905,415,26

gpt2-large_83,"This is because the disease progresses from ""spontaneous"" to ""comorbid."" Spontaneous, meaning an illness that is caused by your own body and/or the environment. Comorbid, meaning you have MS (multiple sclerosis) but also other diseases or conditions like Parkinson's or heart problems, or even another medical condition like depression. Sometimes when a patient has more than one type of disease they can be confused with each other.\r

\r


MS has two stages: \r

\r

1. The first stage is referred to as acute relapses. In this stage, symptoms are mild but often long lasting (sometimes for years). These typically involve stiffness in a joint, fatigue, joint pain, headache, and dizziness. 2. After several weeks of worsening, there is usually a period where symptoms subside completely. Most patients will experience at least some relief within a few days. 3. At this point, symptoms may begin to recur, but they rarely last longer than three months. Many people who think they've had a relapse of MS never do. And many others don't ever want to go back to MS. I know it must seem overwhelming to hear that you might still be having recurring MS symptoms. But remember: It doesn't mean anything bad is happening to you!

\r


Some symptoms that occur during both the initial stage and the subsequent one include fatigue, joint pain, headaches, muscle weakness, and vision loss. A few people develop chronic fatigue syndrome and even a neurological disorder called fibromyalgia; these are all symptoms that could possibly be related to MS.\r

\r


In fact, some people report more severe symptoms that resemble symptoms of ALS. For instance, people with MS who suffer from seizures have been known to recover fully after a partial seizure.\r

\r


Many people who try to tell their friends about MS will say something along the lines of: ""It just goes away...it comes and goes."" That's not true! You're probably going to have episodes of symptoms over time. It's normal to see some improvement over time, but it's important to note that some symptoms take a while to go away entirely. If you experience any persistent or recurrent symptoms, keep them to yourself and let your doctor know what they are. She will likely ask you to stay off medications and help with diet changes.

B: clinical trials have shown that this may be beneficial in improving survival and reducing the risk for other cancers, but it has not been proven effective in preventing recurrence or metastasis after treatment.

C: there are some anecdotal reports suggesting a reduction in the incidence of skin cancer as a side effect from these therapies. However, the effectiveness of any one therapy needs to be confirmed by randomized controlled trial (RCT) before it can be recommended as safe and effective in patients with breast cancer.

D: chemotherapy has long been considered the most powerful treatment for most cancers, with rates of overall mortality falling within an acceptable range. However, evidence suggests that the combination of chemotherapeutic agents used for different types of cancer could produce clinically significant differences in outcomes and should be explored further.

E: there is no evidence that treating high grade glioblastoma cell line with a pemetrexed/pembrolizumab combination therapy will improve quality of life in patients who are taking regular doses of radiotherapy or bone marrow transplantation. However, it might reduce their chances of developing secondary malignancy, such as lung cancer, bowel cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer or melanoma.

F: patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma, which does not respond well to standard surgery, or whose disease progresses too quickly to benefit from conventional treatment options, should consider receiving either pemetrexed/pembrolizumab combined therapy or radiotherapy.

G: pemetrexed/pembrolizumab treatment can increase the risk of certain complications of radiation therapy, including death, and is therefore not recommended for all patients.

H: patients on pemetrexed/pembrolizumab therapy have reported increased discomfort, nausea, vomiting and blood loss during treatment, and this phenomenon persists despite complete elimination of drug. These side effects appear to resolve over time without causing serious harm.

I: pemetrexed/pembrolizumab is associated with potential problems at higher doses or when given soon after treatment has begun. If you experience any adverse effects, report them immediately to your doctor.

People with MS get headaches, fatigue, pain, muscle aches, neck stiffness, and more. Some people report nausea or vomiting, but they don't necessarily know what it means. However, most people with MS feel their pain, so the pain can be mistaken for other things like fatigue, migraines, and other symptoms of MS. But women who have had an early pregnancy may experience postpartum depression that gets worse over time and causes her to become depressed during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, which makes it harder to manage treatment. She also has difficulty sleeping at night and has trouble concentrating on tasks such as reading or writing. Most doctors will say she should try medications for depression first before trying to treat MS. Q: What do women with MS find difficult about having children? \nA: Many women report that finding work is hard because they don't want to leave home. This is especially true if the woman wants a career, rather than taking care of kids. The stigma associated with childbearing is even tougher for them.

My daughter, however, still feels pressured to take care of him while he's away from us. He spends quite a bit of time at work, so there's no way I'll ever catch up with him financially without help. The stress is starting to break down our marriage, and I fear this will continue unless I start talking with him more often about my situation, since he hasn't been around nearly enough. We've tried counseling, but the sessions were too depressing to keep me going. When I try to talk about my life with him, the last thing he says is ""You're making more money now than you did back when you started dating."" That's when he tells me he thinks he knows everything there is to know about me, and doesn't realize how many people hate me because of it. So I stay silent. Even though the doctor told us we might need a new baby, I figured he would just let me have one year of parenthood,",77,How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?,-1.125509262084961,5,q,7,0.02066115702479339,431,16
gpt2-large_1,"There is no single answer. For example, in a survey of 923 American physicians who dealt with diabetes, 7% reported that the prevalence of diabetes was increasing while only 4% said it had decreased over the last 10 years. A similar study found that 40% of respondents were concerned about their patients' future health, while 18% estimated they would be affected negatively by them or those around them. On an even larger scale, one study published in a medical journal showed that people living on less than $3 per day had a greater risk of dying from cardiovascular disease (CVD) than someone who earned more than $80,000 annually. CVD has been associated with obesity as well, with overweight being a major risk factor. In addition, many studies have indicated that individuals suffering from CVD also experience other serious illnesses such as cancer and high blood pressure, which can be exacerbated by diet-related factors. \r

It's not like we're going to be on every talk show talking about this or that thing that you might have heard of that is related to my disease, but it's something people are interested in and they want to hear more about it. So there could be some interest from colleagues too. Q: What would you say if someone asked you to explain your illness to them? A: I wouldn't worry so much about explaining it since I'm not sure anyone else has any clue. But yeah, it would be nice if someone could ask my husband about it because he knows all about MS. He is not even sure it exists, but he has been diagnosed with one and has seen it grow over the years and he thinks it was really well-understood then and now, I guess it's becoming more of an accepted fact and part of a wider story. I am very lucky, actually, having that diagnosis and being able to see it and do things like go back to school for college when my diagnosis came through and finally start doing the things I enjoy doing and that I love. And I have three children who are now living normal lives because of my diagnosis and they got their education the way they should have done so that they didn't feel like they were missing out and were able to pursue other interests than playing video games and watching television.

Certain health issues may occur if you do not engage in regular aerobic exercise. However, a lack of regular physical activity may not lead to health problems or other negative effects on your overall well-being as long as you continue doing activities that help maintain your body's good health. You should discuss with your doctor any questions you have about whether regular physical activity is right for you.

Q: I am overweight. Can I still get enough calories from food? A: Yes. If you weigh 150 pounds (65 kg) or more, you can consume approximately 1,200 calories per day from foods containing up to 100% whole grains and 675 calories per day from fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts. If you are underweight, you will need to consume less than 500 calories per day. The USDA recommends an individual start eating at least 2,500 calories per day but these guidelines are based on a person who weighs 130 lbs (50 kg). Therefore, anyone weighing over 150 lb (64 kg) may want to check with their physician before making weight changes.


Q: How much water do I need each day? A: Water needs vary depending on how many meals you eat, how active you are and what kinds of foods you eat. There is no way around this fact so try to make sure you drink lots of water each day and avoid sodas or sugary drinks. The following recommendations indicate the amount of daily fluid intake needed for individuals who meet recommended protein requirements: Individuals who meet protein requirements:

4,000 ml/day for men and 2,800 ml/day for women = 1 liter/day

Individuals who do not meet protein requirements:

2,500 ml/day for men and 3,100 ml/day for women = 0.6 liter/day The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends consuming between 5-7 liters (1.5-3.0 gallons) of water per day.

The American Heart Association recommends drinking about two litres (about 7 quarts) of water per day for healthy adults and children aged one to six years old. People who are diabetic or have heart disease are advised to limit themselves to one cup (240 ml) per day. Some medications also affect water consumption. These include insulin, diuretics and some antidiabetic drugs such as warfarin.

Note that there are no absolute rules about the best methods to perform these types of movements; however, they have been shown to be safe and effective at improving certain aspects of overall health. For example, many studies suggest that performing squats, lunges, deadlifts, and leg presses may lead to improved cardiovascular conditioning (2), lower blood pressure (3), and a reduced risk of diabetes (4). This is because these specific moves allow a person to increase the range of motion of their entire body through the use of different muscles on both sides of the body. However, this has not been found with all variations of the various lifts in general, so the effectiveness of each variation will vary depending upon how it's performed (5).

To avoid injury, you should always practice your chosen movement only when warmed up first, then gradually progressing to more advanced techniques over time until all potential risks have been taken into consideration. Additionally, the ability to perform various types of movement should be evaluated carefully before beginning any type of workout program. It is important to keep track of progress against yourself and to see if it continues to improve throughout the course of the session. In addition, proper technique must be maintained during each lift or exercise for maximum results.

How long does MS last?\r

MS can cause disability for decades after symptoms appear. You may experience problems with memory, concentration, balance, coordination, speech, vision, and hearing in adulthood. People with MS typically do not live past their 60s. What medications are available?\r

There are two types of anti-MS drugs (also called ""anti-CD3"") currently approved by FDA, which are used to treat relapsing forms of MS. In both cases, the drug slows down the progression of the disease. These therapies include: Glatiramer acetate (GlaxoSmithKline), which reduces the number of immune cells;

Zoledronic acid (Cymbalta); and

Lithium Sulfate (Lomustine). The first class of drugs is called immunosuppressive drugs because they prevent the body from producing natural antibodies. The second class of drugs is antifibers because they block the production of these antibodies. Both drugs are considered safe and well tolerated.\r

What kind of care is needed for MS patients? \r

The first step is to find out exactly what type of MS you have. It helps to consult an MS specialist in order to determine whether or not this is a form of the disease most likely to respond to standard therapy. Often, the diagnosis will involve some testing to confirm a diagnosis or, if you believe you might have another illness such as cancer, blood test or MRI scan. Once you know more about your specific case, you should make sure you have access to effective treatments. One way is to start a search on PubMed.com using the terms ""MS,"" ""relapsing"" and ""remitting."" Many people are surprised when they discover that many papers link MS with HIV. Another option is to visit your local clinic or hospital. Some clinics offer MS services like physical exams and medication management programs, while others don't. Your doctor will decide which one best fits your needs. They may also discuss potential benefits and risks. Ask",63,Will multiple sclerosis affect my career?,-0.0792952999472618,6,q,7,0.024,385,3
gpt2-large_59,"There are many different types of MS and they all have a very low relapse rate. It is more complicated than that, but the research shows it's still within 5 years for most people with this type of disease, so I think if we can find some treatments or strategies to delay that even further we could be able to help many more people. Q: if you were in your position would you try to improve the way medicine works? A: I don't see anything wrong with the current system. If there was something that made me want to change it then I probably wouldn't come back as an MPI doctor.

You also asked about patients' attitudes towards doctors – and the answer from each patient group is clearly starkly different. But perhaps what is surprising here isn't just that there is such a huge variation between individual cases, but that it matters. This reflects our tendency as humans to compare ourselves against others, and to assume that we know how other people experience life. And yet when I asked the respondents who had been diagnosed with MS whether they believed there was any significant difference between their own diagnosis (in which they had felt unwell) and that of the general population, the majority said no. Indeed, only one in ten said they thought people like them had experienced a major improvement over the past five years. The rest felt that, while they might not have suffered a lot themselves, they'd benefited a fair bit from their experiences. In short, there was an overwhelming sense among these individuals that they didn't suffer significantly from MS.

What is more striking is how often people cited their personal circumstances as a factor driving their desire to remain quiet. For example, one woman explained her reluctance to talk about the illness by saying she needed time to think through her options: 'It took me weeks to get up the courage to start talking about my diagnosis.' Others described having to hide their condition because the family members who supported them feared ridicule from friends. One young man described being worried that his parents would 'get rid of him', and another said he couldn't sleep after learning that someone else had recently been diagnosed with the same disease:

I wasn't going to let someone tell my parents what was happening to me… I was thinking I was going to end up on a bed in a dark room with the lights off, alone without anybody knowing where I was. I was scared about losing my home and family… My dad said that it was going to make it difficult for us to live in the city at least for the",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-9.37571907043457,63,q,7,0.3088235294117647,456,0
gpt2-large_54,"It means that a person has MS for at least six months. There are many different types of MS, and each one is diagnosed by the doctor who first diagnoses it. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic progressive disease. At any given time, there are about 100 people in the United States living with MS.\nA: The most common symptoms of MS are: fatigue (fatigue), muscle pain (muscle pain), joint stiffness or numbness (joint stiffness or numbness), and vision problems (visual acuity problems). Each month, about 1/4-1/2 million Americans have some form of serious disability. In addition to these severe, disabling conditions, other related disorders may cause other symptoms such as headaches, confusion, loss of memory, eye problems, skin problems, and hearing problems. These other forms of disability can make life very difficult. When you're diagnosed with MS, your condition goes from being relatively mild to extremely debilitating. But treatment is the key to managing it successfully. You will need to learn to take good care of yourself and to manage your body so you don't develop more debilitating diseases later on. Your doctor may recommend physical therapy to help improve posture and balance, medication, dietary changes, and lifestyle changes (e.g., exercise). If necessary, you might also try certain drugs. Most treatments work only temporarily. You'll probably continue taking these medications until your disease is under control, though they might not be enough if your condition gets worse and your medications aren't working well. As you progress toward full recovery from your disorder, you can choose to stop taking certain medicines or start them again from scratch. With proper management of your health, you should have little or no difficulty getting back into normal activities after you recover from your MS. People who live with MS tend to develop an increased risk of complications like heart attack or stroke. Some people with MS may still have significant cognitive impairment when they get older. How long you stay in the hospital depends largely on how seriously your disease is progressing. If you have a fever, your doctor may put you on antibiotics immediately to keep the infection from spreading. If you feel better within several days, your doctor may move you onto another type of antibiotic. However, if your illness keeps going along with the current antibiotic regimen, your doctor may decide to switch you to a newer drug. This could involve changing your dose, switching to a different brand name (such as azithromycin) or even starting a new course of treatment that's harder on your immune system.

gpt2-large_52,"People who live in poverty and have low levels of education tend to experience high rates of depression, anxiety, suicide attempts and substance abuse. Mental illness is also a significant public health issue, with one study estimating that more than 50% of Americans suffer from some type of mental disorder at any given time. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) estimates that about 25% of adults have an alcohol-use disorder (10 percent with an eating disorder), and 8–9% have a substance use disorder (8 percent with an emotional disorder). \r

As with any other chronic condition such as cancer, depression can become severe and debilitating over time, and it may even be irreversible. Many people struggle for years before they seek help for their condition. Others need professional treatment but do not get immediate results. In addition, many symptoms of mood disorders can be reversed through medication. \r

The NIMH recommends that people with serious mental illnesses receive professional treatment and follow up visits every 3 months to assess progress. Treatment often includes psychotherapy and medications to control the symptoms. \r

People with certain mental health conditions, especially those who require hospitalization for mental health care or psychiatric services such as counseling, intensive outpatient treatments or hospitalizations, should see their doctors regularly throughout life so they receive appropriate care. For example, someone with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia may benefit from regular medical evaluation, psychological testing and counseling, and behavioral therapy to keep them on track. If you believe you may be experiencing a depressive episode or a psychotic disorder, talk to your doctor about the best course of action. You might want to check out our article on ways to reduce stress in your daily life. \r

How Is Depression Different From Other Illnesses? A number of different factors contribute to the severity and impact of depression, including genetic predisposition, biological processes, environmental factors and lifestyle choices. For example, people who develop depression frequently report feeling sad or hopeless, having thoughts of death or harming self or others, feeling helpless or helpless. This kind of thinking seems to occur during times of intense stress, such as when jobs and relationships are difficult to maintain, or when finances become difficult. It has been suggested by some experts that depressed individuals may be less responsive to the social cues used to promote positive emotions like laughter and smiles, and that this may lead to their feelings of being ""stuck"" or ""down.""\r

You can put it into any context you want, but the key point is that it's about all of your body functions being balanced; you're not a person with cancer because there are so many things in your body to balance out. There are so many different kinds of energy systems. When people talk about holistic, they're referring to the whole organism. And one of the things we have to remember is that our body isn't just one thing, it's part of everyone else. If I don't treat my immune system well, then it affects other parts of me. If I don't provide proper nutrition for my children, or if I let them get sick, it impacts them. This type of holistic thinking doesn't just mean treating your health problems with herbs and vitamins; it also means making sure your immune system gets its nutrients from foods like fruits and vegetables.\nA: You've said that holistic medicine is just an extension of traditional Chinese medicine, that it's a mix of traditional treatments with modern science. What did you use when doing research on this field? How much do you see yourself changing your practice based upon this knowledge?\nA: Well, the first step was to figure out what was going on inside of patients' bodies, because that's how the body works. We knew there were some problems with immune function, but there wasn't a lot of information. So we started looking at different areas of the body, such as the liver, kidneys, blood vessels, etc. The more we found out, the better we understood where exactly those problems were occurring. Then, when it came time to find specific remedies, we looked around the world for natural remedies that might work. As far as I know, there are no medical books on the market today that teach practitioners about herbal medicines. That's why I feel like there's an opening up. Because now, if somebody wants to learn these methods and apply them in their own life, then maybe that opens the door for people to really understand how it works. A few years ago, there was a big backlash against alternative medicine. People had concerns about doctors saying ""I'm not gonna tell you what to eat."" They worried if someone ate something wrong, they would die. Now there's a growing awareness of these techniques and how they may be useful to others.

The Role of Memory

What kinds of memories can we learn from cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)? Which types of memory do you think are the most useful? How long does it take CBT therapy to strengthen our memory? Is there any research showing whether CBT improves a patient's ability to recall past events? Would it help a person forget an event as well if he/she learned it again through CBT?

Social Skills and Adjustment

How will social skills affect your ability to adapt to new environments after therapy? Should my therapist monitor these skills at all times? Could your therapist change them to ensure that they remain consistent throughout therapy? Are there ways to enhance social skills while staying within certain limits? When should we expect a change in my social life after therapy?

gpt2-large_55,"If you get the disease, your immune system attacks and destroys the nerves in your brain. The drugs that suppress a person's immune system are called immunosuppressants (in the English language, they're called antiretroviral therapy). It works by suppressing the viruses inside your body so you don't get infected with them or their proteins. But it also affects people who have autoimmune diseases, which means that some of the cells in their bodies attack and destroy the normal cells around them. Your body can repair itself from these damage, but if you still have symptoms, talk to your doctor about whether you should start taking these drugs again.

Can MS be prevented?\nA: One study found no link between the use of certain steroids and MS. There was a small increase in MS cases among those patients on low-dose aspirin or prednisone for several years before beginning treatment, as well as among those who started using corticosteroids early in MS—when there is a higher risk of the disease progressing. You shouldn't take any steroid unless you absolutely know how to do so safely. But experts say most people who want to prevent MS will benefit from having this information, since it helps them to make better decisions about where they choose to live, work, play, and eat. And the same holds true for other types of chronic illnesses such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. If you'd like more information, consult our Web site.

Do you need to drink alcohol?\nA: Not at all. Most studies show that moderate drinking doesn't seem to affect MS. In fact, some research suggests that the risks of excessive alcohol consumption may actually increase someone's chances of getting MS. That said, even very heavy drinkers aren't likely to develop MS. For example, if you drink two beers per day and don't binge, you won't get MS. If you get two drinks per day and don't have a problem, then you might not care what others think about you. So don't worry too much about your drinking habits. Just know that moderation has its limits. For example, you can never go overboard!

How many people in the United States got MS in 2011?\nA: Estimates vary widely, but at least 1 million Americans were diagnosed with MS in 2011.

B: chronic inflammatory pain. A common problem of fibromyalgia patients is the inability to tolerate certain medications (e.g., opioids), so this symptom must be distinguished from other types of chronic disease. In many cases, a diagnosis of MS is made by the fact that all or part of the skin becomes red, inflamed, and taut. The patient may also feel extremely tired or have weakness, even with light activity. However, the cause of this condition remains unclear. Some believe that it results from hyper-reactivity of nerve endings throughout the body when stimulated by electrical stimulation of the skin.

""So, you're saying that patients with MS who are already having their symptoms improved because they were being treated with steroids, which is exactly the wrong approach?""

The doctor nodded. ""It is true that people with MS can get better on medication. But this doesn't always happen. And often, it does not happen when your condition is stable enough to tolerate it, because sometimes there isn't even good evidence that your conditions are improving at all.""

There are no drugs approved by the FDA that specifically treat MS, said Dr. Mark Wannamaker, an endocrinologist at Harvard Medical School. The drug that was used to control his MS — the first one available — stopped working after six months of use. He now takes steroid injections three times a week to help manage his symptoms.

He thinks he would be fine without these treatments. ""I'm pretty sure I'd still be going through the same motions as before,"" he told me. ""But the problem with those medications, especially if they haven't been proven effective, is that they become side effects once they've gone off. So once we start using them, our health deteriorates further.""

What's worse, according to many experts, steroids also may cause serious long-term damage to body cells, including causing cancer in people over 50. ""Steroids will increase inflammation, which increases risk of cancer,"" explained Michael Rosenbaum, chief executive officer of Proviron Inc., based in New York City. ""They will make the immune system hyperactive, leading to inflammation, and, ultimately, cancer.""

Another reason doctors aren't prescribing steroids to treat MS, according to Rosenbaum, is that ""there's a lack of understanding about how the body responds to steroids. Many physicians and scientists think that steroids work by stimulating the production of certain hormones, but that hasn't really been shown in research studies. So it's unclear how well [steroid] therapies work and whether there are any negative side effects.""

gpt2-large_93,"Multiple Sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disorder that damages the brain, spinal cord, muscles and nerves. The condition affects about 1% of adults and children worldwide. People with MS may have symptoms ranging from daily headaches and muscle twitching (myalgic encephalomyelitis) to more severe disorders such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Symptoms associated with MS include fatigue, pain, blurred vision, numbness or tingling on one side of the body, inability to walk, difficulty speaking and swallowing, speech impairment, loss of coordination, joint stiffness, paralysis or weakness, mental confusion, seizures, memory disturbances and difficulties making decisions. Many people with MS also experience sleep disturbance, including trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, recurring nightmares and poor concentration. In the United States, there are 3 million people living with MS who spend at least 20 hours per week without adequate sleep.\nA: People with MS usually don't know they're having MS until it's too late. They can develop depression, chronic illness and other health issues, so early detection and treatment are key for managing these conditions. It is estimated that over 30% of people diagnosed with MS will have moderate to severe complications, but many individuals live with them into their 80s and 90s.\nA: Although no single study has been able to identify an exact cause of MS, the disease appears to be linked to abnormalities in the blood vessels of the central nervous system. It appears that changes in the way neurons communicate could play a role in MS. The immune system has some responsibility in both inflammation and disease. For example, immune cells attack the white blood cell T-cells, which help fight infection by helping to keep the cells alive. However, when the immune system attacks nerve tissue, the damaged connections between nerve cells are destroyed. This leads to the build up of plaques within the brain. This causes the person to become extremely fatigued, often leading to long periods of lack of movement. This type of damage, which results in a state of generalized weakness and even coma, is believed to be one of the primary factors underlying MS. While most people with MS survive, those with less severe forms of the disease may not.\nA: If you suspect you might be suffering from MS, it's important to visit your doctor immediately.

However, further studies are needed to establish the true incidence of these adverse events. \r

Q: Can corticosteroids protect against HIV infection?\nA: Corticosteroid use reduces the severity of HIV infection. Some evidence suggests that corticosteroids may reduce the ability of HIV to replicate within the body and cause damage. When taken together with antiretroviral therapy (ART), there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend their use in combination with ART alone. Although the effect of combining corticosteroids and ART on reducing the risk of AIDS progression remains unclear, they may reduce the risks of opportunistic infections like malaria and pneumonia. In addition, they may prevent relapse in people who take ART and are at higher risk of re-infection. Further investigation into how the use of steroids affects the immune system is warranted. \r

A person's breath holds on a treadmill are classified into three categories: 1) short breaths (ie, 8 seconds); 2) long breaths (ie, 20 to 30 seconds); 3) long continuous breaths (ie, 45 seconds). 4. Long continuous breaths are defined as those that last at least one minute, while short continuous breaths take less than two minutes. 5. A person who takes too much time in taking a breath hold is said to have an ""excessive"" respiration rate. 6. In exercising people, breathing patterns change over the course of a workout; some individuals exhale faster than others, while other individuals breathe slower. 7. A person who exercises more intensely with longer breaths may develop chest tightness due to decreased oxygen delivery. This has been shown by research to be associated with heart disease risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, elevated LDL-cholesterol levels, hypertension, and obesity. 8.

Chest-Neck-Shoulder Exercises With Flexibility

1. Bicep Curls


Begin with the rings on each side of your head. Hold them in place while extending one hand up toward your forehead so the fingers are pointing straight out from the top of the ring. Inhale as you bring your hands together and lift the rings into position. Repeat this exercise three times. Rest for five seconds between sets. When ready to begin another set do 1x5 reps with the same weight for three sets.

2. Neck and Shoulder Rotations

As you sit down take the ring on each side of your head and rotate your neck and shoulders in 90° turns until both hands are fully extended and your body is completely horizontal. Continue with 3 rotations in total. Return to the starting positions with the rings still held in place for 5 seconds before rotating the opposite way. Repeat this routine 10 times. Rest for 20 seconds between sets. When ready to begin another set do 1x20 secs with the same weights for two sets.

3. Overhead Tricep Extensions

Take the rings off of each other and stand with your feet hip width apart. Extend your arms overhead in front of you until they reach parallel. Keeping your elbows close to your sides keep your torso upright. Slowly lower yourself slowly down while keeping the rings at their original height. Once you reach the bottom slowly pull yourself back up over your previous resting position. Do this",130,neck and shoulder stretches,-0.5587295889854431,3,q,7,0.043478260869565216,376,16

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16235522?dopt=AbstractPlus 23% more prostate cancers than men who have not smoked tobacco and 11% more prostate cancers compared to nonsmokers, according to new findings from the largest ever population-based study on this topic.

Prostate Cancer - The link between smoking and prostate cancer may be overstated by researchers at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. Smoking has become the most important risk factor for cancer of the prostate in recent years (1). A report published May 25 in the American Journal of Epidemiology indicates that smoking is the leading cause of death among men under 65 years of age worldwide, accounting for about 17 percent of all deaths (2). It's estimated that approximately 10 million Americans will die from prostate cancer before they reach retirement age (3), while almost 5 million will develop it before their 60th birthday (4).


The study found that although current rates of smoking are declining across the United States, men still tend to smoke more cigarettes per day than women do (5) which suggests that men in other countries may be taking up the habit early as well. According to the World Lung Foundation, there were 8.8 million cases of cancer attributable to smoking in 2004 (6). The U.S. ranks fifth globally for male smokers and ninth for female smokers (7). The problem with this disparity is that U.S. males also consume higher levels of carcinogens than their peers in many other countries. In addition to the harmful effects of secondhand smoke, smokers often inhale pollutants such as benzene and formaldehyde (8).

Men who smoke and have low levels of physical activity are at greater risk for developing prostate cancer (9). Men aged 50-64 with high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol or a history of cardiovascular disease are at increased risk for developing prostate cancer (10). These conditions increase a man's lifetime exposure to dangerous chemicals called free radicals (11). Free radical formation occurs when substances or organs breakdown, releasing free radicals that can damage cells, DNA, and RNA. However, certain types of radiation, like X rays and gamma rays, can kill cancer cells without damaging healthy tissue. Another type of radiation called beta ray radiation is toxic only if the beta ray source is used near an area where the person is",117,stage 4 metastatic lung cancer outcome,-12.792786598205566,182,q,7,0.7338709677419355,407,10
gpt2-large_101,"that's a normal reaction to the high levels of UVB and UVA rays.


The first thing is to get an MRI, which will help you rule out the cause and determine if there are any problems with your blood vessels or nerves. This may be helpful in diagnosing cancer, but it also helps your doctor make sure there is no other underlying problem. If all else fails, take some vitamin D supplements. This should reduce the amount of redness around your eyes for a short time after exposure to sunlight. Your eye doctor can advise on how much you need depending on your age, health status, sensitivity, etc.


Next, talk to your family doctor or radiologist about whether you have a sunburn. It's very common for people to develop such burns during their lifetime, but they're usually not serious and just fade away without treatment. But if you do develop a burn that lasts longer than three days and causes you discomfort, seek medical attention immediately.


Cancer is one of those things that's hard to predict. The risk depends on many factors, including genetics, how old you are, your family history (how long you've had the disease), and other environmental exposures, like smoking, sunbathing, and occupational exposure. It doesn't mean that sun damage has caused you to develop cancer, only that you are more likely to develop cancer from exposure to certain types of radiation.


Sunscreen use is important because sunscreen acts as a natural antioxidant, absorbing sun light so that it isn't absorbed by the skin, thereby helping prevent cancer. People who wear SPF 30-40 are less likely to get cancer since the UVA rays penetrate the skin easier and stay there longer, making them better candidates for protection. However, studies show that even at higher doses, these products don't actually provide as much protection against cancer as we might expect. They work well, however, when combined with other sunscreens.


Finally, you'll want to keep an eye on your diet. Because UVB rays are most damaging when they come through the air, eating fruits, vegetables, fish, meat, eggs, dairy, nuts, seeds, and olive oil daily reduces the chances of getting damaged by this type of radiation.


In addition to avoiding direct sunlight, try to avoid using tanning beds. These devices heat up the skin by exposing it to ultraviolet rays, causing it to produce increased amounts of melanin, giving your skin a ""natural"" tan. Even though melanin protects against certain",101,heavy flares swelling lymph nodes,-13.929986000061035,113,q,7,0.9186991869918699,411,0
gpt2-large_96,"The diet of a vegetarian or vegan, including raw food.

The term ""vegan"" is often used interchangeably with ""vegetarian."" It's important to note that vegans do not necessarily eat foods made from plants. Rather than eating meat, eggs, dairy, or fish, they may use other plant-based products such as soy milk, tofu, nuts, seeds, beans, rice, etc. Some people in the world are vegetarians or even carnivores. For others it's possible to be a vegetarian who eats animal products such as cheese, meats, seafood, etc., but this isn't necessary for health reasons. A good example would be someone who doesn't consume any processed meats. However, some vegans choose to avoid using certain animals' byproducts altogether, which can include dairy, egg, and shellfish products, among others.

How does eating a healthy diet compare with vegetarianism? What about veganism?

Vegetarian diets have several advantages over non-vegetarian diets. They don't have the same negative effects on human health that many non-vegetarians experience, nor do they require you to give up all of your favorite things (like, say, honey) while eating them. Eating a balanced, nutrient-dense, and well-balanced diet of vegetables, fruits, legumes (beans, peas, lentils), nuts, seeds, and whole grains (whole grain breads, pastas, quinoa, oatmeal, etc.) is much more beneficial than avoiding almost every type of animal product (meat, eggs, dairy, and/or fish). You also get far less chance of getting sick from consuming a vegetarian diet compared to the typical American diet that includes all types of animal products.

In addition to these nutritional advantages, there are health benefits as well! Vegetarians tend to have fewer chronic diseases, like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer. Many studies indicate that vegetarian diets provide better protection against cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's Disease than the normal American diet; however, many studies have also found that meat consumption, particularly red meat, increases risk for developing certain types of cancers. These findings aren't surprising because red meat is high in saturated fat and cholesterol, two ingredients associated with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases.

\r

What do we mean when we say that you don't have to be perfect to make it?\r


\r

Psychotherapy focuses on helping people learn how to cope with their feelings better so they can function more effectively in everyday life. People who have been abused may need support to develop coping strategies for dealing with emotional difficulties. For instance, if someone has been abused by an older sibling or parent, they might find learning how to express themselves without being overwhelmed helps them manage their anger.\r


\r

How does it work?\r


\r

Most therapies involve either one session or two sessions of personal interviews. In some, you meet other people who also have suffered abuse and then you talk together about your experience and the types of techniques used at home or in therapy. You share your experience with those you'll discuss it with during the course of treatment. In many cases, you will get a chance to share your story with someone else.\r

The most common symptom is wheezing, usually when you cough or sneeze during breathing and chest pain at rest. If your body produces too much mucus to help fight off infection, it can produce a thick sticky substance called phlegm that sticks to the walls of the lungs (called ""airway secretions""). This thick substance blocks the flow of oxygen through the blood vessels, making breathing difficult.

When this happens, asthma sufferers experience shortness of breath, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, runny nose, and wheezing.

\r

MS affects more people in America than any other disease. It's estimated that approximately 1% of Americans have it, but many others have the symptoms but don't know they have it. In 2013 there were about 26 million adults living with this disease in the United States, but only 2.4 million had a diagnosis. Most people who have MS have an inflammatory condition called rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or ulcerative colitis (UC), which can cause debilitating pain, stiffness, joint swelling, and redness. Often these conditions are misdiagnosed as MS because the condition is similar to another disease called IBD, for autoimmune polyarteritis nodosa. As you may guess, no one has ever proved the connection between RA and MS. \r

\r

About 2-3 years ago, we began receiving a lot of questions from readers about what was going on in their body when they started experiencing symptoms like pain, stiffness, joint aches, and loss of appetite. Many were confused by our response to an article from last year that said eating disorders aren't caused by chronic stress, depression, or anxiety -- they're actually caused by an imbalance of hormones. That study showed that both stress and depression cause your body to release endorphins and dopamine, which makes us feel good and happy. But when you take all those chemicals away from the brain -- including some of the neurotransmitters that trigger feelings of well being, such as serotonin and norepinephrine -- the body goes into overdrive trying to make up for lost energy, causing a cascade of physiological changes that leads to problems like weight gain and diabetes. \r

There are now a number of ways to improve your health without taking drugs. For example, there are things we do every day that help prevent illness. If you start using acupuncture, for instance, or massage, you'll find that your pain will lessen and your stress levels won't be so high. There are also herbs that work better than prescription drugs at treating chronic conditions, including herbs that are effective against osteoporosis and cancer. We've been able to reduce our blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides even while taking medication.

Multiple sclerosis has a common pathophysiology, and many of the same medical conditions that cause MS also occur in women who have multiple sclerosis. For example, multiple sclerosis can be caused by autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus (Lyme disease) or rheumatoid arthritis. This is especially true for those patients with fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome. If you suffer from MS symptoms but don't have MS-related symptoms, then it's important to get tested for all these illnesses before you start taking medications to treat them.

diabetes\nA: Diabetes is an autoimmune disorder that occurs in 20% to 50% of people with diabetes. There are many reasons why you may develop type 2 diabetes. It can be hereditary, it can occur as a result of lifestyle choices (such as smoking), or it can happen due to treatment (such as taking insulin). The risk for developing type 2 diabetes increases as you get older. In general, people who smoke tend to develop type 2 diabetes sooner than those who don't smoke. \rSec 2a : This study looked at the relationship between obesity and cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, triglycerides, and glucose levels. They found that higher body weight was associated with more cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, having a family history of cardiovascular disease was also correlated with greater cardiovascular risks.[1] \rSec 5: The results suggest that diet, physical activity, and genetic factors may influence the risk of getting stroke. To prevent strokes, you should minimize your total caloric intake and increase physical activity. If you already drink alcohol regularly, reduce your consumption to no more than 1 glass per day. This will help control blood sugar, improve your ability to metabolize carbohydrates, and decrease your risk of stroke. \rSec 6: Obesity is one of the major factors leading to coronary artery disease and other conditions related to atherosclerosis. A number of studies have shown that if you are overweight or obese you could be at increased risk of vascular events, including heart attacks, strokes, and sudden death from any cause. You can reduce your risk by cutting down on calories, avoiding over-exercising, controlling excess fat, and maintaining a healthy weight.

The American Heart Association says that cardiovascular disease is the second leading cause of death among men and women aged 65 years and older.[2] \rSec 8: People can die from complications due to heart disease, including bleeding disorders, myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure (CHF), angina, and peripheral arterial disease.

gpt2-large_62,"The first step in disclosing multiple sclerosis to your coworkers is to set up a personal meeting with your boss. Ask that you be given the opportunity to speak and explain why it's important for you to disclose this illness to coworkers. This may happen several times throughout your career. You can also write an email to your manager expressing your desire to share your MS symptoms with others. Be sure to include what you're going through and ask your supervisor to encourage you to do so.\r

After you've made the decision to tell your co-workers, try not to discuss your condition too much (except when you have some other relevant information). This may seem obvious but may be difficult if you feel like there are people who don't understand. Keep in mind that many employees might see you as being less than fully informed about their health conditions.\r

When it comes time to reveal your MS symptoms to your employer, ensure that you take all reasonable steps to make it clear that you understand and appreciate the importance of sharing your disease with those around you. Your coworker's reaction will likely depend on how they view this issue. Some may be supportive or even happy to hear you say that you've been thinking about telling them; others may frown upon it (or they won't know how to deal with it) because they think you should just keep quiet. If your boss says something like ""I'm sorry I didn't realize it was a big deal,"" then it's probably best to just walk away from the conversation. However, if your boss does approach you with a question of his own regarding your symptoms, be prepared to provide additional details such as a photo, description, or even a physical diagnosis (if any), to help him better assess your situation.\r

Keep in mind that it isn't always possible to tell everyone else about your MS. For example, some people fear that having a relative or friend with a similar disability may interfere with the way they view their MS and cause them to feel embarrassed. In these cases, they may refuse to let anyone know about their MS. You may need to avoid talking about MS during your job interview or the next time you meet with a potential new employee. Similarly, your boss might think that it would be rude or uncomfortable to ask about your MS with someone he doesn't already know very well. So you'll want to focus on remaining positive and upbeat while telling your story -- keeping the conversation lighthearted and friendly.\r

\salt\ n \/\/\/\/ salt\r

How much salt does someone need?\nA: Most people do not need as much sodium as people who follow a Mediterranean diet (see below). However, some adults (10% - 50%) require higher levels of dietary sodium due to their high blood pressure (about 1/3 of normal) and diabetes mellitus. People with kidney disease or severe kidney failure might need even greater amounts of salt, and pregnant women (20% - 40%) should avoid excess salt. In general, those over 65 years old (who should ideally follow a lower-sodium diet), need about 15 grams per day of salt, while children younger than 2 years old usually get enough sodium from food (but no more than 10 grams a day). The American Heart Association recommends starting at 5 grams per day and increasing by 500 mg each week. Adults generally need about 25-50 g per day; babies up to 3 months of age typically don't require more than 20 grams per day. Some research shows that people who have high blood pressure often need additional potassium, but this is likely related to their overall blood sugar level rather than specific salt requirements. If you are concerned about your sodium level, talk to your doctor, because it depends on many factors like what your baseline blood sugar was when you were diagnosed and how fast you've been losing weight. A person with a very slow metabolism would need more potassium than a person with a very fast metabolism.

(1) Physical inactivity is defined as having less than 30 minutes per day of moderate-intensity physical activity, such as brisk walking, jogging or tennis. This definition has not changed since 2001. The Department encourages adults to reduce their sedentary behavior by increasing their active activities and/or participating in some form of exercise. The National Institutes of Health strongly recommends that adults do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity every week. (2) Women are more likely to be physically inactive because they have higher body weights than men. In addition, women tend to use sedentary behaviors more frequently than men during pregnancy. Because of this difference, women may benefit from encouraging their nonmaternal caretakers to increase their active activities and participate in some type of physical activity. (3) Adults aged 65 years and older who were not already engaged in regular activity should engage in a minimum of 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity every week. If an adult does not meet this guideline, he or she can develop a fitness plan with his or her physician to achieve the goal. (4) Older adults who did not complete high school but are now enrolled in college or vocational training programs and who meet current physical activity guidelines should participate in at least 50 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity each week. For those participants age 55 and older who completed high school but are still enrolled in college or vocational training programs and meet current physical activity guidelines, they should also participate in at least 100 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity every week. (5) Among persons 65 years of age and older who currently receive Social Security disability payments for knee replacement surgery, physical activity should be assessed monthly during the first year following surgery using the modified QALYs method. (6) Adult patients receiving PACE trial treatment who continue to meet current physical activity guidelines, including both total energy expenditure and physical activity time, will receive additional physical activity support during the second year after PACE initiation. (7) Some individuals who have had knee replacements will never gain full functional independence again if they do not continue to engage in vigorous-intensity physical activity. Thus, it is important for these individuals to begin engaging in physical activity as early as possible.

It is not as simple as just seeing the symptoms of MS and then going to sleep for four months, when you are sure you have it. There's more to the story in terms of what causes MS than just being sick every day. The first step towards getting well is treating all your underlying health problems (such as high blood pressure and diabetes). A few years ago, I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes. To make matters worse, my doctor told me that they couldn't find anything wrong with me so there was no point going to see a specialist; therefore, we had to put off taking any medication until I could control my weight and eat right, which meant that I went six weeks without exercise. This time around, instead of running or riding a bike for long periods of time, I only did them when I felt like it, such as exercising after dinner and while watching TV. Even though I had already been diagnosed with type 1 Diabetes, I wasn't quite ready for it to catch up to my lifestyle at the time. I also struggled with mental illness as a result of not having any form of support from my family and friends – hence why I decided to take advantage of the many opportunities offered by the MS Society to get myself into a rehabilitation clinic, where the doctors were willing to help out and give me some advice. Once there, I met a psychologist called Lisa who helped me learn about how to manage my moods and anxiety and how to cope with depression – things that would become big issues later on in life. In addition, she gave me loads of support – including lots of therapy and group meetings so I could understand what was happening with my health. After a number of sessions with her and a couple of tests, I was finally prescribed medication (which is often difficult to obtain for people with MS), which I took for almost two years before returning home. During those two years, I gradually became less and less ill and didn't really show signs of progress other than occasional flare-ups of MS symptoms. Then, last year, when I returned to London, I got into an accident and needed hospital treatment. Within days I started feeling terrible again and was told I had multiple sclerosis. As if that weren't enough, I found out that my partner and children had also had MS too, but that none of them had ever fully recovered.

gpt2-large_59,"no clear evidence of a causal relationship between the two conditions.

A: multiple sclerosis is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality, but there are no good data on this relationship over time or in people who have recovered from MS.


The overall picture of health outcomes from MS is not well understood. However, current findings do suggest that a high prevalence of disability among some individuals may increase the risk of future disease (eg, because they require more medical care). In addition, the presence of an existing heart condition appears to be associated with a higher risk of future heart disease. There is little conclusive information about whether a person's family history of cardiovascular disease is related to the development of MS. A study published in January 2008 found a strong association of inherited mutations in the X chromosome with a significantly elevated lifetime risk of developing MS. The same mutation was also found in 9% of families of a patient who later died from MS, suggesting that such familial transmission occurs frequently.[3] These studies are limited by small numbers, so we can't conclude anything about these associations; however, if true, then they would provide further support for a role of genetic factors in MS pathogenesis. Further work is needed to understand how the presence of certain mutations increases the risk of getting MS, and why.


We cannot yet say with certainty whether genetic factors play a part in determining a person's susceptibility to develop MS, although epidemiological studies on MS are ongoing. Nonetheless, it seems reasonable to believe that environmental exposures can alter genes, as there is a correlation between blood levels of heavy metals and the risk of several forms of cancer. For example, low levels of lead exposure have been shown to reduce immune function, making people more prone to infections, which has important implications for MS patients. Also, while there are only a few documented cases of children being born with severe autism, many others exhibit behavioral deficits, including difficulties with language and social interaction. It is possible that children exposed early in life to mercury from contaminated dental fillings or inhalation of industrial chemicals could become susceptible to similar issues. More research is required on both sides to examine the role of these factors, but until such studies are completed, it will remain unclear what the best way forward is regarding prevention and treatment.

In general, the effects of medical treatments tend to be greater after the first year of use than at any other point in a patient's life.

gpt2-large_54,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a condition characterized by an autoimmune disease that damages the brain and spinal cord. It is usually diagnosed after a person has had one or more of several symptoms, such as fatigue, numbness in the hands, feet, or mouth, vision problems, difficulty speaking, and seizures.\n\nThe main way to diagnose MS is with MRI scans. The images from these scans are used to determine if someone's nerve cells have been damaged. This can be done through X-rays, which look at how much damage occurs. If there is damage to the nerves, this indicates a loss of myelin, the insulation material that covers neurons, which affects their function. People who experience changes in eye sight may also get an abnormal amount of light coming into their eyes. For example, you might see spots on the retina where the light normally goes. In some people, however, there is no evidence of any damage to their optic nerves. However, the disorder may affect the visual field in other ways, causing blurred vision or seeing only part of things. Some people don't notice any noticeable difference between what they are doing now and what they were doing when they first started having symptoms. Other people report having the same or better vision than before, but no improvement. So, they're still able to perform everyday tasks. As they age, some people get better or worse. In the case of MS, some people do not develop signs or symptoms until years later, while others start showing symptoms immediately after the onset. \nIf the person takes medications to treat their MS, it makes sense to consider whether that medication would interfere with the ability to work or learn.\nSome people say that taking certain anti-inflammatory drugs may increase the risk of developing MS; however, the benefits outweigh any potential side effects.\n\nPeople with MS often suffer from limitations in walking, strength, coordination, and balance, as well as memory issues and mental confusion. They sometimes go out of their minds, become confused, lose touch with reality, and feel like they're just a little bit off. Many people with MS have trouble making decisions about money, relationships, education, sex, and employment because they feel disconnected from reality. Often, people with MS are embarrassed about having MS because they think everyone else has it too. Because it's so common, many people believe there isn't anything they can do. At the same time, many people have difficulties coping with daily life because they can't stop thinking about their disability and cannot",54,What does multiple sclerosis diagnosis include?

gpt2-large_51,"In general, holistic medicine includes not only the study of nature, but also that which lies within the human body and its environment. This means not only treating disease through natural methods such as herbs and supplements but also taking an active role in caring for and providing care to people who suffer from various conditions. The main focus on holistic medicine is on prevention instead of curing or improving the condition of a patient.

Q: Who are some of the patients that you recommend using for treatment with holistic medicine? A: I have always felt strongly about preventive medicine, because my mother suffered from diabetes when she was younger. Her blood sugar levels were very high and she had difficulty walking due to it so I encouraged her to eat healthy foods (and even found out about herbal remedies). When I first started using herbal medicines, it took me many years before I could tell that they worked! My mother used to be one of those patients where if there was any form of medication, she would go into diabetic shock if left untreated. She was treated with insulin injections for the first 6 months after diagnosis so I don't know how much of the problem stemmed from this but I still can see how debilitating the experience was. There were lots of treatments but I still remember being afraid to use anything other than standard anti-diabetic medications until I saw a few doctors who recommended the use of herbal remedies. That's why I have been doing my own research and now try to find a remedy every few weeks. It can take up to 3-6 months for something to work properly once it has been tried but the results do seem to improve over time.


The treatment that I am currently working on is based around herbs, a combination of two of them called ""Gardenia"" and ""Lobelia"". Gardenia is a plant that grows near water and is often used as a traditional Chinese medicine. Lobelia flowers contain more vitamin C which has been shown to treat diabetes and heart problems. For those of us who have already taken allopathic forms of medicine, we will feel better knowing that our health may actually be improved by adding a little bit of Nature Medicine to our medical regimen.

In regards to the studies that support holistic medicine, Dr. Robert D. Besser writes:\nOne thing to keep in mind when looking at studies regarding holistic medicine is that many of these studies included individuals with compromised immune systems. While some of the therapies described were believed to have positive effects on the immune system, this isn't necessarily true for everyone. In fact",51,What is holistic medicine and what does it include?,-0.0182352978736162,0,q,8,0.0,450,26

It's a bit of a broad diagnosis that has no specific criteria, and some people think it's just about lying or being manipulative or having a lot of anger issues. In reality, it's more like having many different types of problems; I'm not sure which is the most accurate label.

Q: do you have any thoughts on what to do if you're considering suicide?

I don't know that there are anything wrong with asking for help when you feel suicidal. Sometimes the only thing you can really do is try to find a way out of your situation, but this often means taking some time off work, possibly staying at home until you get better, going to therapy, or getting professional help. But if you're feeling suicidal in general, please talk to someone about it—the best thing would be to seek professional help. You might also consider talking to someone who knows someone who may be able to offer support. The sooner you get help, the less likely it is that you'll make a bad decision after coming forward.

Q: how long does it take before you start to feel better?

Depression usually takes a few weeks to a month to show up on your physical appearance. After you've had depression for a while, your skin tends to look duller, you will lose interest in activities that used to excite you, you will become irritable, you may stop wanting things as much, and you may become very emotional. This can lead to people judging you harshly if they discover that you haven't been sleeping well lately. This can happen even though you're still relatively happy and functioning normally. If you find yourself suddenly becoming anxious, worried, or upset, check back frequently because these signs may indicate that something has gone terribly wrong. This could include the sudden death of a close friend or family member, an argument with your partner, a sudden financial loss, or other unexpected situations. There are ways to deal with these feelings—try to focus on positive events rather than negative ones, exercise regularly, and see a doctor. Your mental health treatment options will vary depending on what kind of medication you're prescribed, but you should avoid using any alcohol or drugs that might worsen your depressive symptoms. Talk to your doctor about whether you need psychiatric evaluation for anxiety disorders, mood disorders, bipolar disorders (manic-depressive episodes), or substance use disorders.",114,borderline personality disorder symptoms,-5.481744289398193,49,q,8,0.4537037037037037,411,2

Pregnancy

Postpartum patients should be counseled to avoid excessive consumption of alcohol, particularly in early pregnancy. Alcohol can cause hyperthyroidism and result in hypothyroidism. If these conditions occur together, the risk of fetal harm increases substantially. If there is a history of hyperthyroidism in the mother, an adjustment of dosage to prevent potential fetal harm may be necessary.

The use of estrogen replacement therapy after delivery may increase the likelihood of thyroid problems in children born to women taking such drugs.

Prolonged use of hormonal contraceptives may lead to an increase in the risk of postpartum thyroid disorders. Hormone replacement therapy is not recommended if this has been indicated for any reason by a physician.

Breastfeeding

The frequency of adverse reactions to breastfeeding is unknown; however, it appears that adverse effects on infant growth are likely to be similar to those seen in neonates after birth. Because most cases of hyperthyroidism involve maternal overnutrition, breastfeeding cannot be considered a safe alternative to medical treatment. In addition, women who breastfeed may have difficulty controlling their own weight. Breastfed babies are at greater risk of developing hyperthyroidism because they do not receive as much calcium from their mother's diet.

gpt2-large_55,"You can try all the traditional therapies, such as medications and lifestyle changes. But you also need a new approach that combines medication with other treatments to reduce the disability or improve quality of life. For example, in some cases a doctor may prescribe one drug for MS that is not available elsewhere because it has been approved by an FDA-approved study. The other therapy must be started at the same time (e.g., starting a pill before taking the medicine). The key is finding the right combination of drugs and starting them together at the same time. This strategy works best when your symptoms are moderate (no more than three months apart), but treatment should never stop until you feel better or the disease is controlled.

What would I get if I took five years' worth of these medications?

The U.S. government provides data about how effective each pill is against MS, including its safety and side effects. These data show that many people who take 5 years of pills experience a significant improvement after only 1 year. However, some people who take 5 years of pills will continue to have trouble controlling their disease for years afterward and continue having complications. In this case, patients may receive different types of medication over 5 years, which could lead to more serious side effects or even death.

What's the best way to tell whether the medication is working?

If you are already on a placebo, don't start any new pills during your first 4 weeks; the effect may diminish. If you started to respond to your current regimen and then stopped taking it for reasons unrelated to MS (for example, illness or injury), wait four weeks before moving forward with another regimen. Most doctors recommend using an ""as needed"" schedule instead of a ""every day schedule,"" so that you don't forget to take a pill whenever you feel like it.

How long does it take to see benefits from the medication?

Patients take 3 years to see the greatest benefit from the medication, according to recent research conducted by Dr. Siegel and his colleagues. Of course, no single patient is likely to experience a 100 percent response—so it may take longer for someone to see immediate results. The average response rate for MS medications used with MRI scanning was 78% within 2 years of beginning treatment.

Etiology

MS is a chronic inflammatory disease that is associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis and other neurologic disorders. Symptoms are often similar to those caused by other conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, there is no clear cause for this phenomenon. Most likely, it is due to several factors including changes in the way immune cells interact with the nerve tissue of the central nervous system. The most common underlying problem is a malfunctioning immune response to the body's own natural defenses against infectious agents. This may lead to autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues rather than invading foreign bodies. This can also occur following surgical procedures such as brain surgery, bone marrow transplantation or chemotherapy.

Symptoms

The symptoms of MS are varied depending on the individual. Some people experience only mild symptoms, while others might develop more severe symptoms. Typically, the first signs of MS begin shortly after age 20 years and gradually worsen over time. Typical symptoms include the above mentioned:

Daytime stiffness, muscle weakness, and fatigue

Nausea and vomiting

Sore neck and back muscles

Nightmares

Memory loss

Difficulty concentrating

Unable to move a single leg

Frequent headaches

Changes in vision

Pale skin and/or weight gain

Fatigue

Eye pain

Blurred vision

Depression

Dizziness

Weight loss

Decreased sexual ability

Low sperm count

In some cases, MS patients have been diagnosed with the same condition but without any known cause. These people usually suffer from different degrees of symptoms and/or require treatment to avoid further complications.

Causes

There is still much about the cause of MS that is unknown. A number of theories suggest that autoimmune reactions may play a role. One of these theories proposes that autoimmune responses triggered by abnormal stimulation of the innate immune system result in autoimmune disorders. Another theory suggests that damage to white blood cells caused by exposure to microbes could trigger an attack on the brain stem which results in MS. Both of these hypotheses support the idea that the",92,causes of fatigue in MS,-0.1630120128393173,10,q,8,0.044642857142857144,369,24

Mild to moderate forms of MS are easily treatable by medication. Symptoms typically improve within months but it may take up to 3 years before full recovery occurs. Moderate to severe forms of MS are difficult to manage by medications alone but can be managed with appropriate lifestyle changes such as exercise and eating right.


If you have any type of chronic illness you should talk to your physician about potential treatment options. Your doctor will work with your insurance company to determine what kind of treatment may be available for your particular situation. You'll need to decide if your conditions make you more vulnerable than others. Is there something else we can do to protect ourselves from harm?

Treating MS symptoms

How long should I wait between episodes?

MS symptoms usually begin slowly, most people experience one episode during their lifetime (typically every two to five years). Most sufferers experience at least one episode each month. The exact time between each attack varies depending on individual factors like age, severity of the disease, genetic predisposition, and other risk factors. However, in general, people who live longer tend to experience fewer attacks. Also, having MS for 30 years seems to decrease a person's likelihood of experiencing another attack.

What is a remission period?

It takes around 6-8 weeks after taking a single dose of medicine to see signs of improvement. While this is certainly better than waiting until you have an attack, it's still far too long. Although patients can expect to continue to experience improvements through the first year or so after starting to use a new drug, they're unlikely to fully recover in less than 12 months. For many people, relapse after a few months often makes the process even harder. Since there are no drugs specifically designed to increase blood flow to the brain, medicines must be taken daily to avoid damaging the nerves or causing",68,List of multiple sclerosis symptoms,-8.649561882019043,150,q,8,0.6787330316742082,426,16

gpt2-large_86,"I'm afraid not. I think it is a misdiagnosis, and the patient should be referred to an MS specialist for further assessment.

How does it work?

The drug works by blocking a protein called TDP-43 in nerve cells and affecting the flow of calcium ions through them, causing them to die off. This can cause muscle weakness, numbness and fatigue. It also causes some patients to experience headaches, anxiety and depression that persist over months or years. The disease progresses slowly - at least 10% of people with early stage MS will have symptoms but fewer than 2% of those who survive may develop relapsing forms of MS.

What's the risk?

There are no known risks from using this medicine; however you need regular check-ups because your blood levels tend to change over time and they often increase over time. If you're under 40 you should talk to your GP about taking the drug. You can read more about the safety of the drug here.

Is there any other medication for MS?

Yes, there's a new drug being developed which could potentially help treat MS - it has been tested on people whose symptoms didn't respond well to current drugs. This is called a ""chimeric antigen receptor inhibitor"".",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-9.730633735656738,96,q,8,0.7218045112781954,208,0

Q: I have two types of spondylolisthesis (a type of ligamentous disorder). One of my bones has been replaced by one that looks like an old-fashioned pair of trousers. My doctor says there's nothing wrong with this so why do I keep having these problems? Is it because I'm too young to remember when we used to wear them as children? What should I do?\nA: Your spondyle is made up of several pieces. It does not go through your spine; it attaches directly below where your vertebrae meet. When the spondyle goes into the spinal canal, some bone fragments will be pulled out, causing pain. If you continue to have this problem after treatment for other issues, it could lead to further complications.

Q: Who knows what's going on under your skin? Some things look strange. Why would I want to change it? How long does it take to heal from this?\nA: Many things look weird under your skin. While they may appear normal at first, your skin can become very sensitive if something isn't healthy. In fact, this is one reason that it's important to get regular medical checks every year. You'll need to discuss this with your doctor. There also aren't any products specifically designed to help restore normal skin color. All you can do is rest assured that everything will work out just fine.

Q: Why am I seeing more people with MS than ever before? And how come nobody told me about it?\nA: The numbers of people who have MS is increasing each year. However, no one knows exactly why this is happening. A recent study published in Neurology found that as the disease progresses, the number of symptoms experienced increases dramatically. These include fatigue, memory loss, vision changes, muscle weakness, confusion, numbness and tingling, pain, and numbness around certain joints, particularly those involved in the lower body. Researchers believe this increase in symptoms results from patients gradually losing connections between cells in their brain called synapses. This leads to increased susceptibility to neurological disorders.

Q: What are the clinical benefits of the Covid-19 vaccine?

A: The vaccine has been shown to reduce disability, but it is unknown whether this benefit extends to those with MS who are not on a regimen of medications. In addition, the vaccine does not prevent all progression and relapse; thus, persons in which there is no evidence of progressive disease should continue receiving their current treatment.

\r

What if I don't respond to the Vaccine?

If you do not respond to the vaccine within six months after vaccination, your doctor will recommend that you receive another dose, usually within one year. If you do not respond to two doses or more after a single vaccination, your doctor will suggest you receive additional vaccinations as needed to prevent further damage or delay onset of symptoms. (See ""Vaccines"" section below.)

In some cases, patients may experience adverse reactions to vaccines during their lifetime, especially among children. For these reasons, health care providers consider it important to obtain a complete medical history before administering any type of vaccine. You can ask your healthcare provider how frequently such side effects occur in relation to each dose, and also when they might occur.

For example, your doctor may want to know about any recent changes in weight, blood pressure, or cholesterol levels, along with other known risk factors associated with autoimmune diseases. He may also want to check for any allergy to common ingredients used in the vaccines (such as egg protein). When possible, your doctor's decision-maker will ask you for a copy of any family medical history or laboratory test results, particularly if the information relates to an immunization that is given to someone younger than 18 years old. This includes the following questions: \r

Have you had any allergies to foods, medicines, plants, insects, animals, or other substances? \r

Are you allergic to latex or latex gloves? \r

Do you have any history of asthma, hay fever, eczema, sinusitis, or any skin conditions? \r

Because many women experience nausea as well as other symptoms, there may also be some fear of contracting HIV from sexual contact. In addition, women often become ill after childbirth, so they may not want to continue seeing the doctor even though they know they should. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (Photo: Gerald Herbert, AP)

Q: How does alcoholism affect your health? A: Alcoholism affects several body systems. It can cause problems with blood sugar control, heart disease and even cancer. You also might find that you're less physically active than usual. Some researchers think that chronic alcoholism may be linked to increased risk for heart attacks.

Q: What are some common side effects from alcohol? A: Alcohol is an addictive drug and can lead to withdrawal symptoms when people stop using it. For example, one study found that drinkers who used alcohol reported more mood changes than those who did not drink, including anxiety, depression and difficulty sleeping. Other possible side effects include dry mouth, stomach pain, nausea and vomiting. However, most people recover quickly and don't experience these unpleasant effects.

Q: How much do I need to drink per day to become addicted to alcohol? A: Drinking too little can make you dependent on alcohol, making it harder to resist its effect.

A small trial to determine whether low doses of ionizing radiation administered intradermally, over a period of time, are associated with delayed-onset and long-term outcomes after head and neck cancer has been conducted in Europe and North America.8 The results of this randomized clinical trial have been reported recently in the International Journal of Cancer.9 Two hundred ninety-one adults (aged 55 years or older) diagnosed with cervical cancer, diagnosed between July 1996 and June 1998 at six European centers were recruited and enrolled into the study. All subjects underwent irradiation at a site chosen randomly from three sites within the same population. Patients were then followed up for 8 years. A total of 110 patients had complete followup, and 20 had incomplete followup. In comparison with healthy controls, the incidence rate of end points after radiation therapy was 5.3 per 100 person-years, including 3 deaths. Median radiation exposure was 60 mSv/year (range: 24.0–300 mSv/year), with higher average doses being associated with lower rates of mortality. No evidence of excess morbidity or mortality was observed. This is similar to results obtained for studies conducted in Japan and the United States.10

Heavy Flares in My Tumor? What Can I Do About It?

Dioxin is a chemical that can be found in several types of materials, including automotive exhaust, paints and gasoline. Dioxin has been shown to cause cancer and birth defects in laboratory animals. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies dioxin as a probable human carcinogen. While there are no known effects on humans from exposure to small amounts of dioxin over time or during pregnancy, some people may experience health problems associated with prolonged exposure to high doses of dioxin. This information comes from scientific studies carried out by the EPA and other federal agencies. You should not use any products made from materials containing dioxin unless they have been tested for potential health effects. If you believe that any of your household or work-related chemicals contain dioxin, contact the EPA at 1-800-823-4725.

What Is the Difference between Heavy Flares and Heavy Metals?

Heavy metals are metals that emit strong ultraviolet light called solar radiation. When metal particles absorb sunlight, they become heavier, which increases their chances of scattering off objects and causing damage. But because they do not burn up like other organic compounds, they are less likely than other substances to penetrate skin, and therefore, do not appear on skin biopsy samples. A lot of research shows that it is unlikely that metal particles such as lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, aluminum, chromium and nickel would cause health problems if ingested. However, they do sometimes affect blood vessels in the lungs and other tissues. Because of this concern, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned all aluminum containers, although some manufacturers still recommend using them as drinking water fountains for children aged 2 years and younger. If you decide to keep your child in an aluminum water fountain, do so only after consulting your pediatrician about any potential medical consequences.

How Are Heavy Flares and Metals Used in Household Products?

Flare-producing appliances include gas stoves and cooking ranges. Burning flammable materials such as wood, paper, cardboard, fabric, plastics, glass, rubber, polyurethane, aluminum foil, etc., release toxic gases called hydrocarbons or ""pipes.""

gpt2-large_96,"The nutritional composition of the diet is a factor in how well it will be absorbed. Some foods have lower energy density than others. This means that they provide less energy per unit weight, but greater total body mass. Therefore, the amount of energy you get from each food varies with the percentage of its calories that are found in the form of protein (protein-rich vegetables) or fat (low-fat dairy products). Thus, a 1% low-carbohydrate diet would contain about 3 grams of carbohydrate per pound, while a 2% low-fat diet would have you ingesting approximately 6 grams of carbohydrates per pound. For more details on nutrition, visit our Nutrition page.

Q: I've been told by some people to consume only 5% of my daily calorie intake as carbs \nA: While this may seem like a small difference when taken together, the net result is that your body can use all or much more of the carbohydrates available for fuel during exercise. The longer you do this, however, the higher your carb tolerance will become. Also note that some types of grains (especially whole wheat) do not allow for this much glucose to be utilized. That said, there is no harm in consuming these foods. If you choose to eat these foods, you should consider replacing them gradually. However, if you plan to restrict your carbs, it's best to stick to a relatively high fiber content. In addition, if you find yourself becoming ravenous at times, try limiting your consumption of refined carbohydrates, such as white breads, pastas, pasta sauces, cookies, cakes, etc., because they tend to cause insulin spikes, which has also been associated with obesity. You'll want to experiment with what works for you before making any dietary changes. Q: Most people know that carbohydrates raise blood sugar but don't realize just how important this issue is. How can you help people take control? A: It's very important to make sure you're aware of the importance of carbohydrate intake throughout the day and that you understand the role that certain foods play in helping you manage the effects of diabetes. Here are a few tips to help you keep track of your carbohydrate needs: When you begin a new meal plan or program, make sure you check out your current carbohydrate balance first. Remember, if you need additional carbs, your next meal plan must include fewer carbs.

Symptoms

People who are taking medications like this can experience problems with their moods, anxiety and energy levels. Sometimes these symptoms become so severe they impair people's ability to drive, work, attend school, or do other activities necessary for daily life.

Cerebral palsy, which affects most children born after 1945, is another type of epilepsy associated with low thyroid function. People may have trouble regulating the way their arms move, particularly when trying to open doors, climb stairs, or use wheelchairs. They may also be unable to speak due to motor neuron disease, as well as having difficulty moving their legs without help from braces or other devices designed to stabilize them during movement.

HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C infection can cause seizures and sometimes brain damage. While most people don't notice any significant side effects of iodine deficiency until it's too late, some are very uncomfortable at first, causing them to avoid foods containing high concentrations of iodine.

Risk factors

You're more likely to develop a condition related to thyroid dysfunction if you already have certain genetic conditions — like hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism — or if your parents were diagnosed with either one before birth.

But there's no evidence that people who've had thyroid surgery or lived near an active chemical plant or refinery will suffer similar health problems. And studies suggest that even moderate exposure to iodine might reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases by about 20 percent.

When to see a doctor

Seek medical attention if you think you have thyroid disease. Your doctor will probably perform a physical exam on you to measure your potassium level and try to rule out other problems such as blood clots and rheumatoid arthritis.

Causes

The exact causes of thyroid dysfunction aren't entirely clear, but researchers believe that a loss of potassium in the bloodstream plays a role. In most cases, the process of deiodination occurs slowly; however, in people with elevated levels, it takes longer than normal for potassium to disappear from the circulation and return to its resting state.

[21] The answer to this question depends on what the disease is, and how much insulin it needs to suppress blood glucose levels before it can go into remission. We know that about one-third of people with type 1 diabetes (and another third of those with type 2) have no evidence of disease. If we take a look at our existing medications, there are four treatments available for this condition. \r

\r

Insulin shots \r

The most widely used diabetes drugs today are called insulin injections. These are very effective in suppressing blood glucose levels and reducing the risk of developing complications such as kidney failure and heart attacks. In other words, if you use an insulin injection, your chances of having these problems will greatly decrease. Insulin shots aren't perfect, however. There's always a chance that someone might get sick while taking them and develop a serious allergy or infection, and they could even cause brain damage. \r

\r

In addition to insulin injections, there are also two types of oral medication which help control blood sugar. They're called glucometers, and they work by getting rid of excess insulin from the pancreas when the body doesn't need to use it. Both medications require frequent monitoring and don't cure all cases of diabetes. \r

\r

As far as curing, though, there certainly are some clinical studies that show that lowering blood sugar can make people healthier overall. For instance, patients who have had successful diets for several years after their first diagnosis often regain control of their diabetes within six months. \r

\r

Another treatment is called metformin, which has been shown to slow down the rate of progression of type 2 diabetes. Metformin has two effects. It stimulates insulin production in the liver so that the bodies can stop producing more and more insulin itself. And it prevents pancreatic fat cells from becoming resistant to the insulin produced by the pancreas. This means that fewer calories are needed to keep up the body's daily metabolism. That means less weight gain and less pressure on the kidneys. \r

\r

However, metformin isn't the only approach for treating diabetic complications. We've already mentioned that there are other medications that can act like antibiotics in the case of infections and in the case of ulcerative colitis. Another drug, metformin sulfate, is very popular among diabetics because it improves both the function",45,Can diabetes be cured?,-0.010299271903932,1,q,8,0.007936507936507936,400,7

Q: how do i know if my neck pain is from my pillow? A: The most common source for neck pain is an old neck injury. This means that when you were injured and it was repaired, your muscle has become weakened because it wasn't used to its full potential. For example, imagine trying to lift weights with only one arm and then having your shoulder dislocate because of the weakness in your muscles. This will likely lead to some strain on your neck. When this happens, it's very possible that the tension may be causing your symptoms. However, there aren't any specific treatments that help with this situation. Some medications may work at reducing inflammation or tension on the nerves that connect your neck to your brain, but these drugs often don't last very long. Many people also experience more severe problems after they have a major surgery like an operation or spinal cord repair. Other medications tend to cause more side effects than those listed above. In addition to medication, physical therapy and exercise can also help ease stiffness and reduce pain associated with neck pain. You should discuss any concerns about your neck and other physical conditions with your doctor. Q: how do I find a therapist who understands this type of neck pain? A: Ask them what their top three questions would be in regards to neck pain. It will probably sound similar to a medical questionnaire, but it's important to remember that a lot of therapists won't even consider treating neck pain until something really bad or life-threatening occurs. These questions can give you a good idea as to whether or not the individual thinks neck pain might be related to an underlying condition, and it'll be easier for you to get a better understanding of his or her preferences. Q: do you need a referral? A: Yes. Most pain treatment centers require a referral from a physician or licensed psychologist. While we all want to treat anyone who needs our services, we'd prefer to spend time talking to someone whose professional background is in neck pain (e.g., chiropractors, massage therapists, osteopaths), and who isn't too busy trying to cure your headache or back ache. To make sure the person feels comfortable being referred to you, ask him or her questions regarding your neck pain and make sure that he or she knows that you're willing to listen",119,best pillow neck pain,-0.3883178532123565,48,q,8,0.28402366863905326,444,22

Naloxone can be used to treat or prevent opioid overdose symptoms in people with an underlying medical condition that may make it hard to get pain medication, including those who are addicted to opioids. You should see your healthcare provider about taking naloxone if you are currently using any form of oral birth control to prevent pregnancy.


BOTTOM LINE: Birth Control Pill (Plan B One-Step) does not protect against HIV infection. The pill works by stopping the virus from replicating. However, because condoms do not stop HIV transmission, they do not work as well to reduce the risk of AIDS infection, so condoms are often removed during sex.

Q: What causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? A: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is caused by prolonged breathing in certain airways that cause problems with oxygen-carrying lungs. This type of lung disease usually develops at an early age. The condition is very serious and usually requires treatment by medical professionals. People with COPD have trouble working and have problems sleeping because their breathing problem can interfere with sleep. Treatment options for people who develop COPD include medication and therapy to help keep their breath moving properly. The medications used to treat COPD can affect your body's ability to breathe; this includes medicines called inhaled steroids, oral bronchodilators, inhalers, sedatives, diuretics, and others.

Q: How does respiratory infection spread from person to person? A: Airborne infections typically can't hurt someone unless it gets into the bloodstream through a cut or wound or if its airborne particles get into the mucus membranes of the mouth and nose. However, some viruses spread easily from one person to another. Examples include influenza, rhinovirus, cytomegalovirus, noroviruses, rubella virus, parainfluenza viruses, measles virus, human papillomavirus, shigellosis, hepatitis B, smallpox, rotavirus, Ebola virus, herpes simplex virus, and yellow fever virus.",112,symptoms of asthma,-9.302849769592283,120,q,9,0.5714285714285714,228,3

PTSD is not caused by any medication. However, many people get it because of eating too much sugar and/or processed foods such as sugared cereal or fried food. The symptoms can include a loss of appetite (insomnia), tiredness, headache, weight gain, blurred vision, and other neurological problems like headaches, seizures, and weakness. This condition is usually treatable with diet, but there are some treatments to improve the quality of life.


What causes this?

The causes of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome are unknown. It's most often seen in children who have been treated for type 1 diabetes or pre-diabetes before they're diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. A genetic predisposition may also contribute to the disorder. In adults, the cause isn't known. Some scientists think that some form of environmental toxins may cause the disease.


How does Ehlers Danlos Syndrome affect your everyday life?

People with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome have a high risk of developing cancer. The risk increases when you develop osteoarthritis, kidney failure, or heart disease; these conditions all increase your chance of having the condition. Your body doesn't make enough thyroid hormone so its effects on your health may be more severe than usual. If your doctor suspects the condition is linked to thyroid disorders, he might recommend monitoring your blood levels of thyroxine to see if your level is increasing or decreasing. Also, try taking a daily thyroid supplement. Thyroid medications don't work well if taken at the same time as your regular diet.


When is Ehlers Danlos Syndrome diagnosed?

Ehlers Danlos Syndrome diagnosis is usually made after an individual has had two symptoms that are associated with that person's medical history. These types of symptoms should be evaluated separately. Most cases of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome aren't diagnosed until adulthood. So how long does Ehlers Danlos Syndrome last?

Since the onset of symptoms, approximately 25% of people will experience at least one more symptom, which may involve either fatigue, backache, joint stiffness, muscle weakness, dizziness, depression, numbness, or other symptoms lasting several weeks or months. While the majority of people with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome don't progress beyond the initial symptoms, those who do tend to lose interest in activities where their muscles are involved, such as climbing trees, swinging from bars, driving, working out, running in hot weather, and exercising while outdoors. Since there is no treatment available",109,ehlers danlos syndrome POTS nausea stomach pain,-1.80182945728302,0,q,9,0.0,388,24
gpt2-large_83,"This is called an exacerbation. It is the same with rheumatoid arthritis, which we all have because our immune system attacks the joints, so they start to respond and inflammation starts again.\r

[00:37:28] \r

It's also called ""mild"" or ""moderate,"" because it doesn't affect the joint.\r

[00:38:08] \r

When you do get it in your body, we call this disease relapsing MS, or RMS. For people who have had MS for years, it may be mild. When it gets into other parts of the body, that can happen too. In both cases, there are symptoms. And sometimes when a person has these early signs, it's difficult for them to know if they're going to end up having another relapse of MS. So what we try to do is find out as much as possible about how they got it, whether it was autoimmune and not autoimmune (for example). If their MS was caused by something else, then we'll try to determine what causes their symptoms first, before trying to figure out if they should get MS treatment. \r

[00:39:19] \r

We always talk about the difference between disease severity, like from low blood sugar levels, versus MS diagnosis, where you don't know that you have MS until you get an MRI or some sort of physical exam. What we've done in those two situations is to look at the brain and see what happens in the brain when someone has MS. We find that people who have MS tend to have more problems with memory loss than people without MS, and also have less ability to think clearly. They may also be able to recognize faces but not understand what people are saying.\r

[00:40:18] \r

So we want to ask people to go through a test called the Visual Analogue Scales [VAS], because it measures the speed of processing, the amount of mental processing that takes place. Sometimes people remember things better, and sometimes they don't. That helps us tell if this is a case of MS, where people have trouble with thinking skills, or they have trouble remembering things.\r

That way, we can make sure that we can treat it. Often, if you come down with the symptoms, there's nothing wrong physically with you. But with MS",83,Why get episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis?,-0.3689185082912445,28,q,9,0.11965811965811966,380,19

gpt2-large_81,"Yes. You must first be cleared by your health care professional to do so; then you can apply for a disability allowance from the Social Security Administration (SSA) based on both your medical condition and your income, as well as the fact that you have worked at least 20 hours per week in each of the last two years.\n\nIf you are diagnosed with MS, you cannot work or attend school full-time until you receive your SSA disability award.\n\nThe maximum amount you can earn before you lose benefits is $6,000 per year -- about $9,000 per year if you earn more than $50,000 a year. If you need more money, you can ask for a hardship exemption. In addition, you may qualify for federal income tax credits, which will allow you to get up to 30% of your adjusted gross income. See Federal Income Tax Credits for additional information.


How does my state determine how much I should receive? The SSA determines what portion of your benefit is paid to you under the SSDI program. Your State Department of Social Services (DSSS) sets an eligibility ceiling, which is generally higher than the maximum earnings you can earn. For example, if you earned $60,000 as an artist and had been working full time for one year, but only got $28,000 in SSA pay, your eligibility would be reduced to $48,000 because you would not meet the SSA ceiling. For more details, see What Is My State's Eligibility Limit?. This means that even though you may have earned enough to make it through the entire year without having to work, you might still have to take some pay cuts. As long as you show proof of employment, you could eventually get back all the money you lost. For help determining whether your income is sufficient to meet your federal benefit limits, please contact your State Department of Social Services.


What if I already receive disability benefits? How do I receive them again? Once you've received monthly payments, there is no limit to how many times you can receive benefits. However, if you have previously used a state program, such as Medicare or Medicaid, to help defray expenses related to your disability, you won't be able to use these programs again after receiving your SSDI or SSI benefit. If you use another public assistance program, such as SNAP (formerly known as Food Stamps), SNAP may not cover expenses related to your disability.

I had one patient who reported symptoms similar to those observed in other patients with MS. The symptoms included headache, fatigue, nausea, and night sweats. She also reported visual disturbances and blurred vision. There was no history of depression or anxiety before she developed these symptoms. I'm not sure what her diagnosis was, but she said that she didn't feel like herself when she left work early at night. I would assume that this is related to the fact that many people have trouble leaving their homes due to MS and that may be why her problems persisted throughout her pregnancy. What I suspect is happening here is that her brain has been damaged by MS, so there is some kind of damage occurring that may be causing her to experience various symptoms that occur during pregnancy.

There are a number of common symptoms seen in MS that don't manifest themselves as MS symptoms, such as pain in your joints or back, weight loss, joint stiffness, or numbness or tingling in your hands, feet, arms, legs, or genitals.

This is followed by cancer, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, chronic respiratory disease and a variety of other conditions. Although some of these diseases may not be life threatening, they can lead to serious problems in one or more parts of our lives.\nA: Another factor that influences the quality of life of an individual is socioeconomic status, which includes race, age, sex, family history, education level, income, and geographic location. For example, people with incomes below 50 percent of poverty have less access to health care. People who live above 75 percent of poverty face higher rates of poor health than those living below poverty line.\nA: Some studies suggest that socioeconomic factors play a major role in determining both clinical outcomes and mortality. Many people will experience poor health because of their own choices, but others will suffer from lack of physical activity due to poor nutrition, poor housing situation, and inadequate social support or medication. For instance, obesity may increase the risk of all types of cancers including skin cancers. Other factors affecting overall health include tobacco use, high blood pressure, smoking-related illnesses like asthma, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. In addition to lifestyle factors, many studies also show that certain medications such as statins decrease the risk of developing certain forms of cancer. \nA: A study done at Columbia University showed that the incidence rate of lung cancer increased in New York City in the 1990s.

We've tried asking people directly if they're working on things that have nothing to do with the disease and then they'll say yeah. But people don't want to answer questions because they know they might hurt their career. A lot of doctors have a hard time answering simple questions. We try to encourage people to talk to us privately, but even though patients are doing this on our side, we just feel like patients would rather not come forward. We also realize the fact that some people aren't going to want to go public. For example, there was one patient who told me she had a chronic back problem that kept her from having mobility. So when she heard I was researching MS, she asked me, ""What is MS?"" And I said, ""Well, it's an autoimmune disorder."" She didn't believe me until she saw my research. After she took my lab tests, she was able to walk around without pain. Her family members weren't sure whether she had MS or whether her back problems were hereditary.

Most of the time, a keto diet is just fine when you're not diabetic – but in some cases it's an alternative to insulin and may have side effects on your blood sugar control. See below for more information about keto diets vs. traditional glucose counting or fasting, as well as a few tips.


What is the best way to maintain weight loss and reduce body fat during ketosis?

Ketones help reduce appetite and hunger, so losing weight can be easier when you are ketotic. However, it's important that you keep this in mind when you're trying to lose weight by cutting carbohydrates from your daily calories. You'll also want to eat enough fats (or other foods containing protein) to ensure that there is no change in your calorie intake after you start eating ketone esters. A good rule-of-thumb is to consume 1 gram of fat per kilogram of bodyweight every hour. A keto diet will not necessarily make you leaner than someone who does not follow this recommendation, so don't assume that just because you are following the keto diet, you must be thin if you do not meet these recommendations. The goal is to get closer to your ideal body weight before starting any weight loss program or diet.

How long should I wait between meals before starting a keto diet? \nA: In general, you should never eat two large meals within 24 hours of one another, even on a regular day. Many people believe that having one meal while sitting down makes them hungry, which is why they skip breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks on a ketogenic diet. This simply isn't true. We all know that the brain starts to work differently at different times of the day, and we need to let our bodies adapt. When the brain doesn't run as fast as usual, the body becomes much less active. Your body needs to switch from burning fuel stored in muscle tissue to burning fatty acids stored in liver and other parts of the body. There are many ways to burn fat without taking up too much energy (such as intermittent fasting), but the principle remains the same. To learn how to stay healthy and fit while fasting, check out my Ketogenic Diet Guide.

Do ketone ester supplements affect my blood lipid levels? \nA: While ketone esters certainly play a role in ketosis, the exact degree to which their effect on cholesterol is influenced depends on many factors such as personal preference and level of physical activity.",35,Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?,-0.8065668344497681,8,q,9,0.05161290322580645,423,27

Vitamin D is necessary for proper functioning of your immune system and bone metabolism. It also helps prevent cardiovascular disease and several types of cancer. The Centers for Disease Control recommends taking 400 IU (international units, iu) daily from birth until age 70.

The first is to make sure the front of your body doesn't arch while sitting, so that it's not as awkward when standing up or walking around. This exercise is going to help strengthen the lower back and prevent any tightness in the hips. It also helps develop good postural alignment. Another one is to sit on an incline bench with your feet about shoulder width apart, then move them apart about half way before lowering yourself down into the bench. You should feel like you're being held by two people who are pushing you. Then try to maintain this position for at least 15 seconds before moving back to the starting position. When it feels easy enough, raise yourself off the ground until you can do 5-10 reps without having pain/stiffness in the knees (you'll probably have to bend over slightly). Finally, there's another thing called the ""pancake"" stretch. Take a couple of towels and stand with your legs straight out in front of you on a flat surface. Place a folded sheet between each leg, just above the knee level. Slowly lower your legs slowly under your own power from the bottom position, keeping the towel pressed against the back of your thighs. Hold for 2 minutes, then repeat twice more. To keep from hurting yourself, don't let go of the towel. Keep your elbows bent and back arched. Do these three stretches twice daily.

The same stretches can be done with a bandana or other firm support if need be. In fact, I sometimes get really sore joints after stretching, but because I've already gotten plenty of use out of the regular stretches, I only take care of the inflammation afterwards. It makes me realize how much work goes into making sure everything looks right after I start my day. And now that I know how to properly stretch, I am always looking for ways to save time and effort later on!

How did you choose which muscles to train? Did you find the ones listed here to be particularly beneficial?

I've found that all muscles tend to benefit from training as long as they're strong enough to resist the tension produced by the movement they're used in.

F: An injury to the nerves F.1. A physical object is damaged so much that it no longer allows movement and cannot be used; for example, bones are broken; or the nerve fibers become blocked so much that there is little sensation.

F.2. It also means that the problem is not caused by any other cause. This may occur if your symptoms are due to something else, such as dehydration or stress. F.3. Examples of neuropathy include:

Rheumatoid arthritis F.4. Symptoms usually improve with rest and medication. However, some patients still experience difficulties moving their arms or legs, and others experience difficulty swallowing.

G: Difficulty breathing G.1. If your symptoms get worse after taking certain medications or while sleeping, they're probably due to high levels of carbon dioxide (or carbon monoxide). Carbon dioxide causes brain cells to die. When this happens, your body breaks down oxygen into carbon dioxide, which then enters the bloodstream and stays there for about three hours. This process can cause breathing problems such as shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, chest discomfort, and coughing. Signs and symptoms of carbon dioxide poisoning are similar to those associated with high blood pressure, heart attacks, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and aging. G.2. Carbon monoxide can come from the exhaust systems of cars and trucks. Even when you don't know where your car's tailpipe is located, take note of its odometer reading.

gpt2-large_98,"this will depend on the woman's age, and also your own health history. The main risk factor is gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which can happen during pregnancy or immediately after childbirth. Some women who are at high risk for GDM may have a condition called gestational trophoblastic anaemia (GTNA). This means that their cells can't divide normally – they get clogged up with blood vessels that obstruct the normal flow of nutrients and oxygen to the baby and to the mother and her placenta. If you're pregnant with a GTMN, it could be life-threatening if you don't get treatment soon enough, so you should see your GP as soon as possible. However, even if you don't develop any symptoms from your treatment, you might still have problems when your child is born, so it's best not to wait until your second trimester to start your treatment.

What treatments work? There are some types of treatment available for GDM. These include: intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) injections;

streptokinase (statin);

preeclampsia (PND);

cytokine (TK)-induced anti-proliferative therapies such as monoclonal antibodies; and

sulfonylureas (such as amiodarone). What do I need to know before starting my treatment? It's important that you understand how GDM affects your body and whether you'll get any side effects. For example, while some people with GDM feel better after IVIG therapy, others experience severe muscle pain and loss of appetite. You shouldn't just take these side effects lightly. Your GP should explain exactly what happens with each type of medication you use. Read more about treating gdm.

Can I reduce my risk of developing gdm through exercise? Exercise has been linked with an increased chance of preventing gdm, but it isn't clear why. In our study we didn't find an association between exercise and the risk of gdm, although one previous study found an inverse relationship between exercise and the risk of having a miscarriage. Other studies haven't seen an effect either way.

Why are there different risks associated with IVIG and STI treatments? Our results show that there is no difference in the risk of getting gdm between those taking IVIG and those taking STIs. However, because IVIG can cause a longer hospital stay, patients may be offered STI tests",98,most common complications in pregnancy,-9.267436027526855,85,q,9,0.47752808988764045,370,3

gpt2-large_63,"Your ability to work or perform your job will not be affected. You may get a few days of rest, but you can do whatever you want during that time. If your symptoms interfere with your daily life, you should see a health care professional immediately. This is the most common type of MS. However, it's also known as multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS). \r


Your immune system reacts against other substances in your body when they are exposed to these harmful substances - for example, sunlight, bacteria and viruses. When this happens, your immune system creates antibodies which attack those substances. These proteins bind to receptors on your nerve cells. The immune reaction causes pain, swelling and redness. Because you're trying to clear an infection, your immune system often sends out more than one kind of antibody. \r


The first type of MS causes no damage to your nerves. But if you develop MCS, the inflammation gets worse over time. The second type of MS causes trouble with movement and thinking, making it harder to concentrate and concentrating at all. In some people with this form of MS, the injury affects their entire nervous system; others have only part of the brain damaged. For these people, the damage is gradual. For others, there is no permanent change. You'll need treatment each time you get the disease because it can cause serious problems such as paralysis and blindness. After you've been treated successfully, you should never experience any disability from the disease again. \r


What if I have MS and I'm still working full-time?


If you have MS, you may want to consider whether the medical benefits offered by your employer could support your continuing employment. That depends upon your personal situation and what kind of insurance you have available. If you are unable to find any kind of coverage that pays your medical bills without affecting your job, contact your state or local human services department to find information about how to apply for help paying for your medicine.\r


If you qualify for coverage under an employee benefit plan, you might be eligible for Medicare, Medicaid, or a government program called the Supplemental Security Income Program (SSI) for low-income people with disabilities. If you have a spouse who is disabled and has similar income, you may qualify for SSI as well. Check with your state social security office to learn what programs are available in your area. Your employer must pay your premiums for SSI, but if you qualify, you can receive a federal subsidy to offset your premium.

gpt2-large_59,"studies have not found a relationship between MS and prolonged use of the drug.

A: There is no research indicating that long term use of MS drugs causes any long-term changes in health. In fact, many people take these medications for years without experiencing any problems.

B: The only side effect you may experience is sleep disturbance during treatment. If this occurs, stop taking MS drugs until your symptoms improve or you find another way to help treat your condition.

C: Side effects related to MS drugs are rare, but sometimes they occur when the medicine is used as directed (i.e., for longer than recommended). These can include nausea, vomiting, fever, headache, muscle pain, dizziness, depression and anxiety. See the full list at www.msmedsinfo.com/sideeffects.html

D: It's important to understand that there is no evidence to support the use of MS drugs for more than 2 weeks, unless your doctor has prescribed an extended duration therapy using a regimen of medications designed specifically for the conditions associated with long-term disability and risk of relapse and death.


In addition, most people who start off taking MS medication develop the same serious side effects as those seen in the general population. Therefore, if you choose to continue on this medication and experience these side effects, discuss them with your doctor before starting new treatment.

E: To reduce the chance that the MS drug will cause significant problems while your body tries to rebuild its own nerve cells, keep doses low over time. Your doctor should monitor how often you need your treatment and prescribe appropriate dosages based upon clinical trial data. A good guideline is 1 tablet twice daily, taken just before bedtime.

F: The side effects from MS drugs generally do not last very long; however, you must be aware of possible risks associated with taking these medicines. For example, while some patients experienced an improvement after stopping the drug, others did not. If you feel the benefits of the medication have diminished or disappeared, you should consult your doctor about alternatives. Some people prefer not to change their medications, so you'll need to determine whether it's safer to remain on your current treatment plan or try other options such as cognitive behavioral therapies (cognitive behavior therapy), natural supplements (natural products like herbs), acupuncture, psychotherapy, massage, chiropractic care, etc.

gpt2-large_54,"Multiple Sclerosis is a disorder of the nervous system. It affects about 300,000 Americans and is caused by an abnormal protein called the myelin sheath that covers nerve cells in your brain and spinal cord. The disease usually starts at age 25 or 26, after which you may experience symptoms for as long as 20 years. You don't know what's wrong until something changes in your body. For example, if you have high blood pressure, you might develop chronic pain, headaches, fatigue or joint problems, while some people with MS can also feel numbness around their eyes and ears, and other signs and symptoms are rare. In fact, in 2010, only one-third of adults over 65 had been diagnosed with MS. But new diagnoses have increased dramatically since 2000, and in 2012 there were more than 2.4 million Americans living with MS. Some doctors think this increase reflects improvements in diagnosing the condition, but others say new treatments and tests such as MRIs and PET scans are making MS much easier to diagnose. People who do not respond to medications or surgery are often referred to neurologists, who specialize in treating the disease. (More on Time.com: 10 Things You Didn't Know About Alzheimer's)

Other methods include going through a list of possible causes and following up with a therapist or counselor on what works best for you.\nAnother way to help yourself cope better with certain types of feelings is by practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, yoga, and even music. You might also try using medications prescribed by your doctor or psychiatrist, which can reduce your anxiety levels. If medication is not working, talk with your doctor if it feels like there is nothing else that will work. As long as you continue to take this medicine and do other things that helps alleviate your anxiety, your condition should improve over time.

Vitamin D deficiency is also a common issue, especially in children. For this reason, some doctors recommend taking an oral vitamin D supplement. There are several options on the market now, but I am currently using the Daily Multivitamin and 2,000 IU of Vitamin D3 daily along with two other supplements, which provide me with roughly 700 IUs of vitamin D. The Daily Multivitamin has been helpful for my overall health and I have noticed significant improvement in my skin condition. My doctor says that the daily intake should not exceed 3,000 IU or 400 mg. of vitamin D per day. As we age our bodies begin to lose their ability to make vitamin D. If you want more information on how much vitamin D you can take at any given time, see this link here. You may have seen them advertised in magazines like Allure and People magazine. They claim to give your body 25% of your recommended daily allowance of vitamin D. This is an estimate based on a study done in 2002, where about 1/4 of Americans were found deficient, so the actual number could vary. It would be wise to do a blood test before purchasing these products as there are no studies showing that they work. The main problem is that most people find that even when taken correctly, there is still too little vitamin D. However, if you are looking for something to help boost your vitamin D levels, take this product. It contains a supplement made from algae called Phytic Acid. If you read the label, it claims that you can use it during pregnancy. However, we did not notice any side effects to our baby, so we took it anyway. We saw a reduction in breast tenderness and decreased swelling of our nipples after just three weeks.

- Q: I have high levels of thyroid hormone and was taking anti-thyroid medication. What are the consequences? A: The anti-thyroid drug may cause more problems than it solves. If you take an anti-thyroid drug to reduce your thyroid gland, you will likely be experiencing low T3 (triglyceride) and low T4 (sugar). High T3 is not good for anything but weight loss. Low T4 is bad for muscle mass, bone growth, hair, nails, etc. The only way to decrease the levels of these hormones is with a healthy diet. Your body can't make them so they must come from somewhere else in your life, which means that what you eat and drink determines how much of the right kind of hormones are released into your blood. You could also try taking thyroid supplements, or even eating enough thyroid food to maintain normal thyroid function. It's important to note that TSH and free T3 both drop when your thyroid gland goes dormant. This happens most often during pregnancy. Some women can go months without having their TSH drop because they don't really notice it and it just disappears along with the rest of their body. In other words, this is one reason why women may experience some estrogen effects when using birth control pills.

- Q: Is there a difference between TSH and T 4? A: There is no difference between both hormones. They all work on the same mechanism. These days there are many different types of thyroid hormones available. Since many doctors do not know what ""normal"" amounts are needed by their patients, some physicians now recommend you look at your serum TSH level first before doing any thyroid hormone supplementation. So if you're looking to see whether you need to increase your dosage, ask your doctor about what his/her normal range would be. A few years ago, we did a study on over 400 men. We found that men who had higher than normal TSH had a lower risk of prostate cancer. Our data shows that even though our body makes different amounts of each hormone, and even though we produce less of each of these hormones than people without thyroid disease, we still have the ability to improve our health and increase our chances of surviving cancer. It's also possible that if a man has low levels of a particular hormone he may live longer because of the increased production of certain enzymes. So it's best to talk with your physician if you want to determine your own personal optimal level of these",123,hypothyroidism symptoms,-6.979298114776611,66,q,9,0.4074074074074074,428,1

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 1. Some people with normal vision can have a condition called myopia which causes them to see things in sharp focus in dim light. 2. Some people with low vision can also have myopia, but this does not usually cause serious problems. 3. There are several types of myopes; one type is characterized by blurry vision, while others tend to be able to see well at night and out at night. 4. Myopic children who grow up in poverty may experience less severe myopia than other children do. 5. Many people with myopia develop visual disorders later on in life. 6. People who don't see clearly should make sure they have adequate light exposure and that they keep working or studying as much as possible. 7. Myopia-related eye diseases such as glaucoma are generally milder than most forms of blindness. 8. The best treatment for myopia involves regular use of dark glasses. 9. I'll try and explain what myopia really means in layman terms if you want to know more about it. 10. This question is about how to find information about prescription glasses. As far as we've been told, there is no easy way to find information on this subject.

Glasses for Computer Users Summary of Findings A few years ago I came across some interesting news items online. One of them said that glasses were becoming very popular among computer users as it was considered ""easier"" for them to read text on large displays. It was reported that this phenomenon was partly due to improved image quality when compared to computers from 20 years ago (it turned out that the larger display size gave the better picture). Another report stated that some parents of school kids had tried making their children wear glasses so that they could watch videos more easily. However, some parents felt that these glasses did not provide enough protection and that they only increased the number of times their child would stare at a computer screen each day. Although there were no clear answers regarding whether the glasses could actually help to improve reading performance, those looking into the issue found that the glasses had many benefits. The main benefit that I saw in using the glasses was reduced glare. To understand why glare becomes a problem, consider the following analogy.

gpt2-large_22,"That's a very serious disease. You're not going to have this if you stay on your diet and exercise, but it can be really important to watch how much sugar is in your food.

Q: I hear that some people start eating too many sugar-sweetened beverages. How do they get those calories? Are there any healthy alternatives to that? A: The answer is yes, but it depends on the brand of beverage and what kind of carbohydrate is being consumed. Some brands are made with simple sugars like glucose, fructose, or lactose, which don't raise blood pressure or cause weight gain as quickly as higher glycemic carbohydrates, such as high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). If you drink a cola, make sure it doesn't contain HFCS. If you want to cut back, try drinking a sports drink instead.

Q: What should I avoid when it comes to sugar? A: Avoid all refined grains and processed foods including soda and sweeteners; limit added sugars in nonfat dairy products (such as yogurt); keep your total fat intake below 10% of your daily calorie needs; reduce the amount of fruits and vegetables you eat each day; choose unsweetened coffee over regular brewed coffee; try cutting back on saturated fats; and consume more fiber. Q: Is there anything else I should know about my diabetes? A: There are two main types of diabetes – type 1 and type 2 – and both can occur together. Type 1 diabetes develops slowly and usually does not progress. It occurs naturally within the first few years of life. Type 2 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that damages the pancreas and other organs and tissues throughout the body. This condition can affect anyone. Symptoms may include hives, rapid heartbeat, blurred vision, swollen feet or legs, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, joint pain, sweating, increased sensitivity to cold or heat, difficulty urinating, and skin rashes.

How we treat diabetes can impact your overall health. As noted above, insulin is the medication that controls the release of glucose from cells and increases metabolism and quality of life. In order to decrease risks associated with Type 2 diabetes, patients should follow specific treatment guidelines. For example, people with diabetes need regular monitoring by their healthcare providers and can take medications like metformin or metformin plus glargine (Miglitazone) to control blood sugar levels for up to 12 months.",22,my risk for developing type 2 diabetes,-5.304438591003418,121,q,9,0.484,397,16

MS-Specific Tests for a Specific Condition

The following tests are not specific for MS or any other chronic condition (except for some medications). They may help you determine if your health problem is due to MS, but they cannot diagnose or treat MS or help you manage other conditions. They will help you understand what is wrong and how to correct it. For more details on these tests, see: Multiple Sclerosis Disease Screening Test

CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE TESTING

Tests for Cervical Spinal Cord Injuries

You will need one or both cervical spine exams (spine X-rays) every 6 months during the first year after you stop using your prescription contraceptive pills to monitor your progress toward normal functioning. You should continue having these exams until you have had no further abnormal changes in your spine. A total of three exams may be done at different times throughout the course of the disease; however, the doctor must do two of them during each 5-year cycle. If you use combined oral contraceptives (contraceptives containing estrogen, progestin, male hormones or another hormone), the third exam may be done less frequently.

For women ages 18 through 49 years old, a cervical spine exam occurs when your cervix is gently pressed between the upper ribs. This is most often done within 1 week after stopping your pill and may require several additional sessions.

For men ages 18 through 49 years old, a cervical spine exam occurs when your penis is rubbed against the side of your neck while standing up and touching the top part of your head. The examination also involves rubbing your penis against the lower part of your neck. The procedure may also involve the use of an applicator that extends across the back of the neck, making contact with the top part of your head to feel for swelling and other abnormalities. In addition, a physician may use a special instrument called a ""pelvic floor muscle"" to examine this area of the body to detect spinal cord injury. A total of three pelvic floor muscle examinations occur at least once per year.

Treatment: Cytokines and immunosuppressants.


Cases of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) have been reported in the United States, although the number is considered relatively low. In some cases patients present with painless peripheral neuropathy, a progressive reduction of the sensory perception, muscle weakness, hypotension, ataxia, and visual disturbances. Some patients may also develop signs of systemic inflammation, such as rheumatic fever.


There are no vaccines or treatments for this disease. However, corticosteroids may be helpful to control the worsening symptoms over time. The use of NSAIDs, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, has been shown to reduce the progression of SPMs, but not SPMS.


The most common type of primary progressive MS is relapsing-remitting (RR), which can occur at any age. RRMS presents with symptoms that generally begin in early childhood, usually about 5 years after the first primary episode. It tends to worsen gradually until the patient's health deteriorates beyond recognition. Patients typically experience pain and fatigue as well as cognitive impairment, vision abnormalities, hearing impairments, speech difficulties, and an inability to function independently. Most people recover completely within 3 years.


Primary progressive MS is characteristically associated with several autoimmune disorders. It appears to result from chronic destruction of myelin sheaths on nerve fibers that provide information processing. These damage results in impaired axonal transport, resulting in an increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, and CRP. There is evidence that these inflammatory effects are caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the receptor for interleukin 6 (IL-6R). Thus, a person who develops a form of primary progressive MS should receive treatment with IL-6. A significant proportion of children with RRMS will eventually progress to secondary progressive MS (SPMS); however, there are very few known genetic factors influencing this development. Therefore, it is critical for individuals with primary progressive MS to have comprehensive medical screening and followup every year for 10 years, including both laboratory and clinical evaluations.",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-0.0180791337043046,9,q,9,0.06766917293233082,323,11
gpt2-large_93,"Yes, but I don't know the evidence. If you have symptoms of MS (which is more common than we thought) that include sleep disturbances or memory difficulties, and those are caused by a chemical imbalance, then I think you should see your doctor.\nB If the symptoms are due to other causes such as an autoimmune disease, it's better for you not to get involved with medications unless there are clinical signs that warrant a change in treatment. Please refer to our section on MS Treatment Options below if you're worried about taking drugs without first having a medical evaluation from your doctor.\nC: My patient had been prescribed one month of hydrocortisone and this was a very mild dose and he got better quickly. He also saw his neurologist and they did tests and said, ""You must be depressed."" But nothing else seemed to be wrong, so he continued taking the medication. The next day he went back to the neurologist and said he felt fine. So there were no side effects and he stopped taking the drug. We decided to go ahead and let him take all the medicine at once because it wasn't working well. One week later he started getting headaches again. I called my husband who works in health care policy and politics. He said I shouldn't prescribe these medications to anyone who has never done any work before and I asked what sort of proof they had to say that he could do this job. And he told me how many years ago they sent me to graduate school and how hard their curriculum was and they showed me how difficult it would be to apply for a good job here. Well, when I applied, I got into grad school only after several months of studying, including reading books and learning new things, while taking classes, which I found much easier than teaching in a classroom. The problem was that I couldn't show up on time each day and I was often late and I really didn't want to miss my classes. When I left med school, I worked two jobs and went through the motions of being a student until I finally gave in and took out loans to cover tuition. \nD: What are some of the most common misconceptions about MS treatment options? Are there any myths that doctors need to clear up for patients?\nA: There are certainly some myths around treatment and treatments for MS. But most of them aren't true! In fact, the more accurate ones are probably ""Just keep doing what you're doing!"" That's all the information we can give you.",93,Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?,-0.3517609238624573,7,q,9,0.03535353535353535,440,37

Q: Does the vaccine work against HIV/AIDS? \nA: Yes, it works to a certain degree against HIV\r

Q: Is there any risk of side effects from the vaccine? \nA: There is no evidence that the vaccine poses an increased risk of adverse events due to immunization with the vaccine itself, nor do we believe that the potential risks posed by immune cells (such as CD4) will be significant enough to alter patient outcomes based on immunization. However, if you experience an allergic reaction after receiving the vaccine, consult your health care provider immediately.

Q: Can I get the vaccine even if I am infected with HIV? \nA: You can receive this vaccine regardless of whether you have been diagnosed with HIV infection.\r

Q: How long does the vaccination last? \nA: For most adults, the duration of protection is usually approximately three years. For children, it may take longer. If the vaccine contains live viral particles, then the vaccine should be administered within two weeks of exposure. In rare cases, such as for injection using disposable syringes during surgery, children may require up to four months' immunity. Children under 12 months are generally protected until the age of 16.

Q: What's the difference between the vaccines used in the U.S.? \nA: Both doses of this vaccine contain live virus. This protects children and adults alike from contracting an infectious disease caused by viruses like measles and mumps.\r

Q: How is the vaccine licensed? \nA: The CDC's Division of Biological Standards approves vaccine candidates through a process called clinical development.\r

Q: What happens when the vaccine becomes available? \nA: When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gives the go-ahead for one of these vaccines to be produced, production begins at a plant in Florida.\r

Q: How many people would need to be vaccinated before the vaccine became widely available? \nA: Based on data provided by CDC officials, the average number of vaccinations required to protect children without HIV is currently around 1,500.\r

Q: Do parents need to consider vaccinating their kids? \nA: Most likely they won't. Parents are encouraged to discuss vaccine options with their child's",72,Is the Covid-19 vaccine safe for people taking multiple sclerosis drugs?,-0.7455844283103943,60,q,9,0.28169014084507044,385,50

back pain\r

Back pain can be caused by many things, such as back surgery or degenerative disc disease. For some people, there are treatment options that can improve their quality of life. These may include physical therapy or medication, depending on your condition. The best way to manage back pain is to make sure you do regular physical activity such as exercise. It will also help relieve stress in your muscles so you feel more comfortable. If this doesn't happen, try a relaxation technique like yoga or tai chi to relieve tension. Your doctor can prescribe medications for certain conditions, but most back problems can be managed without medication if you follow these steps: Tension headaches - relax muscles that control them and keep them from tensing up when stressed. See your doctor if this keeps you from doing daily activities. Back injuries or diseases - have an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan to look at the spine or other parts of your body. Ask about the type of injury. A spinal cord injury often involves damage to the nerves that send messages to your brain. Some doctors think that nerve disorders, such as multiple sclerosis or Lou Gehrig's disease, can lead to spinal fatigue. This may cause you to tire quickly, which can be problematic during long journeys. Injuries from sports - take time off work or school, or rest if necessary, if you're injured because of a sports accident, an accident involving machinery, or a fall.

stress - find ways to reduce or avoid stressful situations in your life. You might try talking with friends and family members, taking a walk around the block, or getting out into nature. Try to get away from your computer and cell phone screens at all times. Sleep deprivation - avoid sleeping too much, especially after a workout. Have a routine of waking up between 8 and 10 am. Get enough sleep to stay alert and relaxed throughout the day. Avoid caffeine at night. Do not drink alcohol before bedtime or during the day. Eat healthy foods. Exercise - for example, walk outside and run around the neighborhood, or go for a bike ride. Take a warm bath or shower before going to sleep. Relaxation techniques - play music or read a book.

Eating disorders\nA: These are common, and can include bulimia, anorexia, eating disorder nervosa or binge-eating disorder. They often start as normal weight fluctuations - if you gain more than 2kg over a year, for example, then this may signal that you are having an eating disorder. Many sufferers will also experience depression and anxiety, which can make things worse. Some people have no history of an eating disorder before being diagnosed; others may have a family member who has one.

These foods may increase your risk for developing type 2 diabetes or heart disease, so you need to be careful about how much and when they're eaten. Q: do I really have to put together my own meals? Can I substitute one food group for another? A: no. You just need to know which ones are high in calories and nutrients and don't waste time cooking them all.

If you have been through the mental health system before then you are likely familiar with some of these terms. You may also know that they are not used very often in this context as they tend to make people feel guilty about their mistakes or bad experiences. Psychotherapy can help you to gain perspective on your situation so you can do things differently next time.

(3)What is a ""Psycho"" therapist?\nA: A psycho therapist is someone who has trained by practising different therapies. This means that he/she has had to work hard to develop his skills. Some examples are counsellors, medical professionals and psychologists but most therapists use techniques such as hypnosis, mindfulness meditation, cognitive behaviour therapy, interpersonal therapy (IEPs), role play and other techniques that enable them to learn from their clients' problems and improve their ability to deal effectively with them.


It is important for you to consider whether you wish to get professional help from any one of the many people offering psychological services. The key is to determine which approach works best for you, how long it will take you to complete and the cost associated with each treatment plan.

(4)How can I find out more about my options?

You should call your GP first to check if there is a specialised program that would suit you well. Once you have made an appointment with your psychologist, you may want to visit the clinic where you have been referred. You may also contact the specialist programs listed below.

(5)Do I need to pay anything to see a psychologist?

Yes. There are several fees involved in providing counselling services, including costs for equipment and supplies, and even for setting up sessions. In addition, some programs charge for the time spent by members of staff working together at all stages of the process.

For example, if you receive counselling only from 2 psychologists, then the total cost for counselling services provided would include:

2 sessions – £20 per session (£1 per hour);

2 days of training – £35 (depending on the type of programme); and

£100 (for private sessions).

When considering paying for counselling services from one of these programs, remember that they vary considerably in cost. Therefore, you should try to compare different rates and prices before committing to",53,what is psychotherapy?,-3.0152032375335693,16,q,9,0.08888888888888889,414,6

The effects of the drug are similar to those seen with other antihistamines, such as Chlorpromazine. But unlike these drugs, Glucophage does not cause nausea or vomiting. A single oral dose will relieve most cases of gastrointestinal symptoms. For people who suffer from severe abdominal pain, however, it is best to begin treatment with a larger dose once they have fully recovered.

Glucophage also works quickly and effectively for most types of asthma attacks and allergic rhinitis (anaphylaxis). Patients should be treated within 30 minutes after first feeling an attack of any type. If an attack occurs while people are sleeping, they should take glucophage before bedtime to help block the release of histamine in their bloodstreams.

Because of its fast action and ease of use, glucophage can be used at home or in offices without making a trip out to the pharmacy. When starting therapy, you may want to ask your doctor about using this drug only when necessary. Your doctor might suggest that you follow up with a few more doses if you experience signs of increased intolerance during treatment.",108,chronic diarrhea short-term memory sweating inability to regulate body temperature heart palpitations dysautonomia,-9.981492042541504,45,q,9,0.7627118644067796,186,5

Your doctor should determine the best treatment plan for your specific circumstances. For example, if you're taking insulin because your blood sugar level is too high or you have type 2 diabetes, you may want to increase your intake of healthy food such as fruit, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, low-fat dairy products, and more. This will help lower your risk factors and improve quality of life. (For more information about this topic, see Chapter 5.)

What are the symptoms of diabetes?\nThis section describes the symptoms of Type 1 diabetes. Some people may not feel any symptom at all, while others may experience some pain in their legs or feet when they sit down, shake their body, move around, or take other physical activity.

What causes Type 1 diabetes?\nSome research suggests that genes play a role in determining whether someone has type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. However, there is no single gene that causes diabetes. Instead, several genes appear to play an important role, particularly one known as PPARG, which promotes the production of beta cells and results in the accumulation of fat and white cells in blood vessels. Researchers believe that this contributes to the development of Type 1 diabetes. In addition, certain foods, including those containing fructose, also contribute to the development of diabetes.

Can I get diabetes from eating too much carbohydrates?\nWhile it's possible for people who don't suffer from Type 1 diabetes to eat large amounts of refined carbs, the evidence linking these carbs to the development of Type 1 is inconclusive. For instance, a study published in 2004 found that adding glucose to meals lowered blood glucose levels by just 3 percent and did not significantly affect markers of inflammation in the blood. Similarly, studies have suggested that the amount of sugars consumed might influence how well a person's pancreas works. Research into Type 1 diabetes has focused on the relationship between excess calories and weight gain. For instance, a recent review article in Nutrition & Metabolism examined data compiled through 1993 from more than 20 randomized controlled trials and concluded that while there was ""an association"" between higher protein consumption and increased risk of obesity among overweight individuals, this effect appears to depend largely on caloric content of the diet rather than total calories consumed. The authors concluded that ""no plausible mechanism exists for the association between excessive dietary carbohydrate intake and increasing rates of obesity."" However, another report published in January 2011",45,Can diabetes be cured?,-0.7364554405212402,30,q,9,0.23809523809523808,432,5

gpt2-large_126,"it is not that simple. In fact, I was told there are no natural cycles so the procedure would have to be done artificially. For example, they could create a small egg or sperm cell and then implant them into the ovaries. But this technique isn't really viable because when you implant an egg in the womb the fertilization is already done before the process of maturation can begin. Therefore it doesn't really work well for those who want to get pregnant naturally.

Q: How many people were involved with the project?

A: It's difficult to say how many people have been involved, but I think we did about 15-20 people at most in total. The most important aspect of the whole project was to study these cells and find out what they do. We wanted to learn everything possible about them.


Q: What were some of the challenges that arose from the discovery?

A: One challenge was understanding where the nucleus comes from. So we had to figure out exactly where the DNA came from and how it got there. Another issue was how much of the gene is necessary for this particular function. Also, if the cell dies, does its genes go with it? So we had to figure out all these things together.

We also discovered two new types of gene - one is called Tlr3 and the other is called Ogr1. And this is a really exciting thing as these are very interesting genes, which means that they may lead to treatments for diseases such as breast cancer. This could potentially help women who might need treatment during pregnancy. But first we must figure out if these gene changes actually cause any problems. Then we will know more about their role on fertility.

Another challenge was making sure that these cell lines were healthy enough so that they wouldn't become infected by bacteria and viruses. There are different kinds of bacteria in every body and they can infect various places including reproductive tissues. This was another major challenge. If our research is successful, we hope that scientists will soon find ways to use these cells to treat genetic disorders.

Finally, we made some mistakes along the way. As a result, we had to make a few modifications to the cells' genome. However, in some cases we managed to improve on what had been previously discovered.

Q: You said you didn't get funding for your work until now. Why so long after the fact?

gpt2-large_112,"it can also be related to a number of other medical conditions. It may be caused by an imbalance between the body's natural, or inhaled, gases and gases produced from the body, including the air we breathe in and out. There are two main types of asthma that affect children: bronchitis and wheezing, which is often referred to as wheezing in children and wheeze in adults. Most children with asthma have either one or both of these problems. Children with the most common form of wheezing in children are called ""wheezing attacks"" and they start at about 1-2 years old and last for less than a minute (about 5 seconds). In those who do not respond well to medication or who do not get better quickly, these episodes can become longer, lasting up to 2 hours and sometimes several days. The same type of breathing problems are known as asthmatic attacks in adults, although some people develop them while pregnant or breastfeeding. These attacks usually occur every few minutes during waking time but are typically short - usually only a couple of minutes long. They come on suddenly, starting with a short gasp before gradually becoming more pronounced until they feel like a full on huff or puff. You will know you've had an attack when you cough and stuff your nose. An attack can happen very fast if it has started earlier than usual. If you think you or someone else is having an attack and don't immediately get help, you could pass on this condition to your child.

Symptoms \nB: what causes asthma? A child with asthma develops a chronic lung disease that changes their lungs over many months. This means that as they grow older their lungs change as well. As the child grows older, there are fewer areas in their lungs where they produce airways which makes it harder to clear mucus from their respiratory tract (respiratory tract). As the child gets older, the area around the mouth becomes more prominent and hard to clean. When a young child starts to cough or sneeze or has trouble breathing, they might call their parents or doctor and ask for assistance. Over time, asthma worsens with age because the child's immune system starts attacking its own tissues instead of just those in their lungs. People with asthma get different kinds of symptoms depending on whether they live near homes with lots of pollen, smoke, pet dander or dust mites, or where they were born (birthplaces). Most people living close to places where there are lots of these things tend to",112,symptoms of asthma,-3.6249282360076895,60,q,10,0.2857142857142857,432,17

2)What is your opinion on the importance of public education about the prevention of cancer? How much would you say this issue has been neglected in our times? What are your views on the use of new technologies, like genetic testing and genomic mapping, which help us uncover many unknown diseases?\nA: Public awareness and treatment of cancers is a very important topic, especially when they occur in old people and those who are living with these ailments. Cancer affects men and women equally regardless of age or sex, even though there may be a slight difference between male and female risk factors for certain types. Many studies have shown that there is no clear link between lifestyle habits and risk of developing specific types of cancer. One key factor is the presence of an underlying tumor. This means that the person with the cancer will not have access to effective treatments, so he/she must remain vigilant. On average, 60-80% of cases of lung cancer in young adults in North America and Europe were found to be due to smoking (Cancer Causes Control 2008). More research needs to be done on the effectiveness of modern tobacco-free products, particularly since this area is still considered a very controversial one. \r

Risk factors for obesity: physical activity levels and health outcomes

As well as physical activity, the following health characteristics are also important predictors of weight gain and/or obesity:

Age (years)

Sex

Race and ethnicity

Height (inches)

Weight (pounds)

Family history of diabetes or hypertension

Physical activity level

Diet quality

Hormonal status (testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, thyroid hormone, and others)

Obesity may vary by race/ethnicity, sex, height, weight, family history of diabetes or hypertension, diet quality, and hormonal status. Studies suggest that obesity is more prevalent in women than men (1), although there is no reason why this pattern should be universal.

In general, overweight and obese individuals tend to have poorer overall health and experience greater morbidity and mortality compared with normal weight and underweight individuals. The following table summarizes findings from studies examining these variables:

Revelation comes in two forms, literal revelation which has been written down in the Quran and also metaphorical revelation which came with Prophet Muhammed (PBUH), i.e., when He received revelation through his companions during His lifetime. Some Muslims consider this process of revelation to be more real than literal revelation because it has always had a spiritual element to it. For example, some say that if Allah sends an angel to tell you to do something that would make you sin, then he will tell you something similar in the hereafter (such as 'I am sending another angel to remind you'). This means the angels are really communicating with us (and sometimes even with God Himself!). Also, some say that God revealed new verses at different times during Muhammad's life, as well as in different circumstances. Thus, Muhammad (PBUH) may have had several revelations, but he did not receive them all at once (there could have been several revelations from God during Muhammad's lifetime before anyone ever read a single word of the Quran). All these explanations are considered part of the concept of the ""revelation.""

Numbness in hand

The most common cause of numbness in your hand is injury that causes a narrowing of the arteries supplying nerves in the back of your hand to your brain. This results from swelling in an area of the artery that carries blood to the inner part of the hand. If this enlargement does not heal properly, the narrowing can become too tight to allow blood to flow freely from the arm to the brain. When this happens, you will experience a feeling of weakness as well as numbness in your hand. This type of numbness is known as:

anterolateral wrist, finger Numbness A: a form of pain that develops when there is compression of a radial nerve causing a small portion of nerve fibres to be compressed; for example, when someone gets his thumb caught between two bars while he leans over to pick something up, causing him to feel pain or discomfort in his wrist. B: a form of pain where there is normal nerve conduction (no sensation), but there is loss of sensation either in the affected side of the wrist (radial Numbness B) or in the area above the wrist (tendinitis). C: a similar phenomenon, except that the pain is felt only on the non-affected side of the wrist (dorsal Numbness C). D: a similar phenomenon, except that the pain is felt only on the non-affected side of the wrist (mild medial/lateral Numbness D); the symptoms include lightheadedness or tingling (or both); and can last anywhere from 3 days to weeks.

gpt2-large_94,"Eventually. There are people who have had multiple sclerosis for a long time, and they're not feeling like themselves anymore at all. They're not even able to walk normally. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't be on the lookout for symptoms of MS; it's just something to keep an eye out for so you can get treatment as soon as possible.\r

Treatment for multiple sclerosis is very different from the typical treatments available for other kinds of disease. For instance, anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen or aspirin) are often prescribed for pain relief and relieving muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis. However, many patients find this ineffective because there are no effective therapies for multiple sclerosis. That's why researchers began investigating compounds that could help improve function in the brain during multiple sclerosis. In 2014, researchers reported finding that S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a compound found naturally in green tea, was able to stimulate nerve cell growth and reduce inflammation in MS patients. SAMe has also been shown to work well alongside traditional anti-inflammatories. One study suggested that SAMe may be a more effective treatment than either anti-inflammatories or physical therapy alone.\r

What happens after a patient experiences their first attack of MS? \r

After they've experienced their first attack of MS, they'll experience a gradual reduction in activity throughout the day until the symptoms diminish completely over several months to years, and then return when their symptoms begin again. If your diagnosis is severe enough, it might take up to three years for patients to come off anti-inflammatory medications, and the number of new cases of MS will continue to increase at least through 2023.\r

How do multiple sclerosis symptoms differ from those associated with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease? \r

MS symptoms vary depending upon whether the person is experiencing them at the same time. People with early onset MS tend to be very fatigued, lethargic, have increased movement problems, and experience cognitive impairment. The symptoms appear gradually; however, they progress quickly once someone becomes disabled. Other people may experience symptoms similar to those seen in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Disease. Symptoms of multiple sclerosis can include headaches, difficulty concentrating, loss of appetite, weight gain, fatigue, joint pain, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, vision changes, depression, and trouble sleeping. These symptoms typically occur about 12 weeks after an individual develops symptoms.\r

Q: what does an ectopic pregnancy look like?

Most pregnancies that are carried to term have an ectopic pregnancy, or an incomplete pregnancy (usually called an ectopic due to the lack of an embryo). This causes problems, including shortening of the uterus, birth defects such as spina bifida and Down's syndrome, and sometimes serious health risks. During your pregnancy, you will probably experience some pain during intercourse, but this usually passes quickly. Your baby is born about 28 days after conception when your Fallopian tube is open, and then stays attached to the uterine wall until it is ready to be expelled by the end of the third trimester. After delivery of the placenta, your body begins to produce hormones which cause contraction of the muscles around the uterus causing contractions that can be felt throughout the abdominal cavity. These contractions may feel slightly different from those experienced at birth because they are not connected to the movements of the cervix, so it is important to know how to respond to them. The first contractions of labor often feel uncomfortable but don't last long. It should take less than 2 hours for these contractions to pass, though some women report longer lengths. Thereafter, it is best to relax, rest, or use medication to help ease any discomfort. If your labor continues for more than 2 days and becomes difficult or painful, call your doctor immediately. Most doctors recommend getting medical care if possible before going into labor again.",98,most common complications in pregnancy,-7.616567611694336,47,q,10,0.2640449438202247,264,4

Categories of MS in Adults and Children

Adult MS is a common chronic disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Many adults with adult onset MS have multiple sclerosis (MS). Multiple sclerosis affects up to 50% of people who have MS. Approximately one-third of people diagnosed with MS will develop additional forms of MS after diagnosis. These other forms include myelin disorder (myelopathy), and optic neuritis. In addition, many patients may be genetically predisposed to the development of more severe forms of MS or who are treated for their primary form.

The most commonly reported types of adult MS are relapsing remitting (RRMS) and progressive multifocal leukoencephalomyelitis (PML). Other types of MS are familial relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (FHMR), focal pontine glioma, and nonfocal intracerebral hematologic malignancies (NFIHS). Treatment options for each type vary according to risk factors. Most patients who respond to therapy improve over time, although treatment failure rates remain high at approximately 40%. There are also individuals who do not respond to treatment or who relapse. Patients with RRMS and those with MM are different from others; they are more likely to receive chemotherapy before responding to therapy, and they often require hospitalization during remission periods as well. The vast majority of cases occur in adolescents, but there has been an increase in MS among older adults since 2009. Some studies suggest that the incidence of all three types of MS has increased dramatically in the last several decades.

There were estimated to be about 14 million people living with MS worldwide at year end 2013, representing 12% of the global population. About 1.8 million new cases of MS were recognized nationally during this period. The median age of people with MS was 62 years (IQR 52–69). Of these, 731,000 adults aged 65 years or older and 487,000 children under 18 years old had a",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-9.169232368469238,61,q,10,0.29901960784313725,375,6
gpt2-large_54,"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic disease that affects the central nervous system. It causes many symptoms and can be progressive, which means that it gets worse over time. This condition cannot be cured and treatment is based on managing symptoms. There are four main categories of MS: auto-immune (also called auto-inflammatory), non-auto-immune (also called auto-proliferative), autoimmune and chronic, which can all result in the same symptoms. Each has its own specific set of treatments and may even differ between individuals. There are other conditions related to the immune system, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). You also have an increased risk for developing cancer (which can cause more inflammation) and certain types of heart disease or stroke. In addition, there are some genetic factors involved with MS. For more information, please read our summary article about MS. \nA: The disease begins when cells in your brain become inflamed and then they start damaging your nerves by sending out messages that tell them to stop functioning. \nB: Your body's natural defense mechanisms break down these signals, allowing the damaged parts of your brain to grow back. This process continues until you develop the signs and symptoms of MS.

gpt2-large_51,"Well, in the last century or so, there have been a lot of different approaches to healing that incorporate both traditional practices such as shamanism and alternative approaches, like acupuncture. It's also important to note that holistic medicine has not always applied itself to diseases that were traditionally treated with conventional medicine (such as cancer). There are still some people who consider themselves holistic but don't practice any form of holistic medicine. In fact, many mainstream practitioners in traditional healers' communities do not even use the term. The word ""holistic"" has also come into common parlance for a wide variety of things -- from nutritional supplements to herbal remedies and homeopathic remedies. A number of natural products have now entered the marketplace on this basis. For example, you can buy vitamin C capsules at Wal-Mart that claim to contain 100 percent pure vitamin C. But they're really just sugar water capsules made out of corn starch, which you may know by its brand name, Fanta. The same goes for the botanical supplement company L'Oréal Paris' ""Natural Beauty Vitamin C."" These brands generally offer a mixture of vitamins and minerals, plus antioxidants like carotenoids and other substances that protect your skin against free radicals. \r

Some people think the term ""natural"" means that certain ingredients aren't harmful; in reality, some natural chemicals can be dangerous. So what exactly is natural? Most people would agree that it doesn't mean anything good -- only that a particular substance has no side effects. That's why we often say something like ""it tastes good,"" or ""this product smells great,"" rather than saying, ""This is really healthy!"" \r


What is holistic medicine, then? According to Dr. Gary Null, a physician and author of Healing Natural Medicine, the term implies that there is no harm involved when using a specific substance as an adjunct to conventional treatment. Rather than just taking one drug to treat all kinds of ailments, he says, modern medicine tends to focus more on the individual component parts of a therapy and less on the whole thing -- which can lead to problems.\nA\nIn the past two decades, there has also been a significant shift away from focusing primarily on treating symptoms over curing disease. Instead, physicians are increasingly emphasizing prevention rather than cure, including diet, exercise, lifestyle changes, stress reduction, mental health counseling and medication. One benefit of this approach, according to Dr. Null, is that patients typically respond better to these approaches.

gpt2-large_85,"What to expect as a first step, and what you can do during treatment.

When one person experiences an episode of MS, patients typically experience some type of relapses—and this is true for both MS and other diseases such as cancer or AIDS. This means that if you are experiencing relapses, it may be prudent to see your doctor about treatment options. However, some people who experience relapse after a few months of therapy still have a significant amount of disability because they require daily activities beyond what most people with MS take care of on their own. As your disease progresses, the time frame in which you need to take medication (or avoid medication entirely) will increase. There are also certain medications which can make it difficult or impossible for someone with MS to respond fully to medications, so it's important to keep these options in mind when considering whether to continue treatment.

What treatments might work best for me?

The best way to learn how different treatments affect patients' symptoms and recovery is to talk to your doctor. Sometimes there are specific strategies which should be taken into consideration in order to find the best treatment option for each patient.

How common is hypothyroidism?

The prevalence of thyroid disease varies greatly by age group. The following chart shows that thyroid dysfunction affects an average of 17% of children over the age of 5 years. In addition, a substantial proportion of infants (4%) suffer from hypothyroidism as well. There are also many individuals with autoimmune disorders who develop hypothyroidism. Although there have been studies showing that thyroid abnormalities may be present in up to 70% of patients diagnosed with Hashimoto's, this does not mean that all people with hypothyroidism will experience hypothyroidism.

Are there different forms of hypothyroidism?

Hypothyroidism can result from either type I or type II deficiency. Type I hypothyroidism typically manifests itself with mild to moderate, localized pituitary gland enlargement, resulting in an underactive pituitary. This condition is known as primary hypothyroidism. It is sometimes referred to as ""juvenile"" hypothyroidism. Primary hypothyroidism may be accompanied by other neurological manifestations, including cognitive impairment and motor impairments. Most often the symptoms are transient. However, at times they can become chronic. Type II hypothyroidism results when there is an excess of iodide in the blood. This condition is called hyperthyroidism. When these conditions occur together, we call them mixed primary and secondary hypothyroidism.

And when it comes time to go through therapy and get help, I would just like to know that there are other options out there if needed.Q: How long does the medication take to kick in?A: I've been off the medications for 3 months already but they'll come back after 2-3 more weeks, depending on how well I recover from the surgery. I will continue to use them until the end of the year.Q: Have any friends or family members told you about your condition or helped you along the way?A: Yes. My boyfriend had a few people talk to him about my problems before my mother found out (she was already aware). She knew enough of the symptoms that she said ""It sounds like a serious problem."" Her response was, ""I hope so."" So I guess I can thank her for letting me know that she knows and that she cares!Q: Do you think there's anything wrong with having ADHD and being an anxious person?A: Yeah, definitely. But as I stated above, it could have something to do with genetics or upbringing. If my mom hadn't known about my condition, then I probably wouldn't have found myself in such dire straits. But by knowing that she knew, I realized that I wasn't alone. If you don't understand why your parents are angry at you, try looking up some other negative traits.Q: Is your mother upset with you because she thinks you should be taking care of yourself better?A: No, not really. There's nothing I could say to her because she knows all too much. She was fine with my getting into trouble in school as long as I didn't break any rules or hurt anyone. That's all she cared about.Q: In the video you made saying ""I'm sorry"" for crying at the end, did you mean it or were you laughing at the moment?A: Oh no.

Q: if I eat more than 1,500 calories a day, can I still get type 2 diabetes? \nA: Yes, you may be able to avoid or reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes by eating less than 1,000 calories per day and maintaining a healthy weight. However, if you do not consume enough carbohydrates (such as in foods such as breads), vegetables, fruits, fish, nuts, beans or legumes (especially soybeans) to meet these needs, it is important to talk with your healthcare provider about whether this will help you avoid or reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Q: what's the best way to control my diabetes and prevent its complications? \nA: Your goal should be to get regular check-ups (biopsies and other tests are recommended) so that your doctors can determine the cause of any changes in your body chemistry, metabolism, or insulin sensitivity that may occur during treatment and how to take care of them. Also, it helps to limit the amount of sugar you drink - and avoid drinking excessively sweet drinks (e.g., soda or fruit juices). It may also help to take the medication metformin with meals, which is taken in pill form. And, make sure you keep your blood pressure under control and maintain an active lifestyle so that you don't become overweight while taking metformin.

Q: What does all of this mean for me? \nA: If you're at risk of diabetes, it is imperative that you seek medical advice from your doctor right away. There are many ways to lower your risk: You should consult your healthcare provider about any other treatments you've tried, including drugs, supplements, and natural products. These could be good things to try, but they may not work for everyone.

Your physician has the option of recommending a diet that emphasizes whole grains, fresh produce and lean protein - like poultry, seafood and eggs - instead of refined sugars and fat. They may also recommend making some adjustments to your medications, especially if they haven't been working well for you.

What causes multiple sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis occurs when the immune system attacks healthy tissue in the body, causing inflammation, swelling and other signs and symptoms. It is usually found at an early age (usually before 5 years) during childhood or adolescence. Some studies show that as many as 70% of people who develop MS have it before they reach age 15. The exact cause is unknown, but research suggests some factors may play a role. This includes exposure to certain chemicals or substances from vaccines, environmental exposures such as smoking, autoimmune diseases, chemotherapy drugs like prednisone and steroids and radiation treatment. However, the actual number of cases remains unclear because of several reasons. First, most tests for multiple sclerosis are performed on adults, which means children don't often get tested for this condition. Secondly, these tests look for specific abnormalities in the brain rather than at the whole body, so they're less likely to detect more subtle changes that occur over time. Most of the testing done today is ""test-based,"" meaning doctors use MRI scans to determine if someone has MS. While this is helpful, there's no way of knowing how accurately such images represent what actually happens inside the brain. And even the best MRI machines can only see parts of the brain, leaving out important parts that could be involved in MS. There's also a high rate of false positives - patients diagnosed with MS after a scan turn out to actually have another disease. Finally, new imaging methods are being developed that would allow doctors to see more complex patterns of brain activity, which could lead to more accurate diagnosis of MS. As part of its multiyear study of different treatments for multiple sclerosis, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society conducted a study where researchers used fMRI technology to test whether different types of therapy might help improve MS symptoms. In their results, researchers concluded that combining a low dose of corticosteroids with exercise led to improvements in the number of functional MRI images taken per day. They also found that these treatments were effective against more severe forms of MS, such as relapsing-remitting MS, so further research into them is needed.

A: yes it happened in April 2009 to May 2010

Q: where did they diagnose him?

A: at an outpatient clinic. The hospital had been called a few times and said they needed more testing done on my husband but no diagnosis of MS were made there.

Q: when did your husband begin feeling like this?

A: He started getting depressed after being discharged from the hospital and then had to be admitted twice to see another specialist. This time he was told he had MS.

Q: when did you learn that your husband had Multiple Sclerosis?

Q: how often does this happen?

A: often within 3-4 months after he becomes ill.

Q: why has my husband's reaction changed so dramatically?

A: Because he felt very guilty because he knew he didn't want people to know what had occurred in the past. Also there are many other symptoms in his health history which show signs of MS.


After reading through all this information and listening to it firsthand, Dr. Wilson said it sounded too good to be true...which it most certainly was! According to my husband, ""The doctors told me I was healthy and nothing could get worse."" And in fact it got worse. In June 2011, our family had a massive heart attack. It caused so much pain that we couldn't even move. We also had numerous episodes of vomiting (and still do) when we're sick. Our son suffered a head injury in 2013 and we suffered severe headaches, dizziness, nausea, exhaustion, and weakness. As a result of all this, my husband's vision went bad and he started bleeding internally. Since then, he has gone through an MRI of his brain every three weeks and each time it shows signs of a stroke. In the past week alone, his blood pressure shot up 500 points! In addition to these physical problems, we've noticed changes in my husband's mood, cognitive abilities, and ability to take care of himself. For example, he'll sometimes cry in",57,multiple sclerosis stages phases,-12.483631134033203,148,q,10,0.714975845410628,404,2
gpt2-large_86,"There is evidence that some patients may have a more prolonged course of MS, which increases the risk for relapses and progression. However, there are also reports in which those who experience a response to treatment (at least at first) do not achieve remission in asymptomatic individuals. Thus, it is difficult to definitively determine whether a therapeutic effect is achieved or if the disease progresses. The severity of neuropathic pain from MRI of primary progressive multiple sclerosis may reflect the degree of disability or lack thereof with respect to motor function and sensory input. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis is associated with a lower-than-average incidence of neurological deficits related to disease activity. Most studies evaluating long-term effects on cognitive function suggest significant impairment (e.g., 20%–40%), but the findings vary widely among investigators. No data are available regarding neuropsychological functioning in patients with MS. There are no data supporting the use of medication with potential deleterious effects on cognition; however, this remains an area of ongoing research. Therefore, we believe that future work should focus on determining possible benefits and risks for these agents in specific patient populations. Finally, although several different drugs target multiple sclerosis (eg, dacarbazine), their use has been hampered by drug interactions with the immune system, as well as side effects. Although many medications are effective in treating MS, there remain serious concerns about their safety and efficacy in both adults and children. Additional studies will be needed to assess this issue further.

BEDMINDS:

While MS affects every aspect of life—from physical and mental health, to cognitive, social and occupational functioning, and even daily activities such as driving—it continues to be underappreciated. This is due largely to a lack of information about what the illness entails and how it can affect your quality of life and ability to participate fully in society. In addition to the clinical trials conducted thus far, much of the current knowledge comes from two other sources. One source is published literature on MS, specifically its treatment options, outcomes, complications, and the genetic basis of MS. The second source is published literature from persons with MS, particularly anecdotal accounts of people affected by the disease. Both of these sources provide important clues about how MS impacts each individual. Understanding the breadth and depth of the information available is critical to understanding how to best manage the disease, including identifying appropriate therapies for prevention and care of the chronic symptoms.

gpt2-large_93,"A recent study from the National Institutes of Health found that more than 1 million Americans with MS were suffering from insomnia, or difficulties falling asleep. Sleep deprivation can lead to severe sleep disorders such as narcolepsy. However, it's not clear how much sleep is needed for a person to function normally, so this isn't necessarily a bad thing. The reason we don't know is because most studies have been done on people who have moderate-to-severe symptoms, like chronic fatigue, headaches, high blood pressure and sleep apnea. \r


The NIH report says that people with MS who suffer from these sleep problems also are more likely to be overweight, to smoke heavily (which often leads to cardiovascular problems), to take medications for depression and anxiety, and to develop diabetes. So, while you may think you're getting enough rest -- or at least being fairly well rested during your day -- you might be missing out on some very important benefits by neglecting bedtime. \r

Q: How do I know that vaccines are safe for children with autism and other health problems?\nA: We believe we have demonstrated this safety in animals. See below, ""Vaccine Safety Studies in Animals"".

Q: If I receive a vaccination against influenza, should I be concerned if my child is sick or has been hospitalized because of the flu? \nA: Yes, you may want to call your doctor right away and discuss the risks associated with vaccines. However, most strains of influenza viruses can cause mild illness without serious complications. Most people recover from such viral illnesses within two days. For more information about this topic, visit the CDC's website at http://www.cdc.gov/flu/.

Q: Why does my child get a flu shot even though he's not contagious with it?\nA: The flu virus is very infectious before its symptoms develop and spread easily through the air. Before these symptoms occur, the flu virus will usually start to replicate inside your body. After the symptoms do appear, the flu virus will either die or enter dormant mode. This means the virus will continue to multiply but will never reproduce again so there won't be any risk of infection after the symptoms occur. So while you might think you're getting a flu shot, the chances are that your child isn't actually transmitting the flu to others.

Q: Where can I find information on how to protect myself from being exposed to the flu during an outbreak? Can I just buy a spray bottle and wear it around me all summer long? Or what should I wear under my clothes when I'm outdoors?\nA: Here's some helpful advice: Wear long sleeves and pants (and boots if necessary) and stay out of water. Wash frequently with soap and cool running water. Do not go swimming. Avoid contact with surfaces where germs could be present. Use hand sanitizers if possible, especially as soon as a rash appears. Wear goggles when outdoors. Remember, however, that these are only guidelines. A good rule of thumb is to wear shorts and socks indoors at least 20 minutes a day, then cover up in layers of clothing and use them outdoors only if absolutely necessary. In general, avoid getting too close to plants, pets, and children; don't feed or drink anything they touch; don't leave food out unattended; and keep well away from large crowds or crowded places.

Jaffe, The Importance Of Grandparents For Patients With Multiple Sclerosis: Evidence From Two U.S. Studies (1999) (noting that ""a minor niece has never contributed more than two percent of her own annual income"").

If a person dies without receiving an annuity payment, then the remaining amount--after interest and other expenses--will go into the trust fund used to pay the estate taxes on the deceased's assets. The value of the trust fund may vary depending on the type of beneficiary; however, generally speaking, an individual will receive a substantial portion of his or her estate tax free.\3\ In addition, unlike other types of gifts, all such amounts will automatically become taxable by statute.\4\ Although the VA's policy on gifts prohibits payments outside of the trust fund, a potential recipient of the gift could still legally make a contribution through another source of income.

Q: Can you share your experiences with other patients? What kind of reactions did they have to taking these drugs, and what side effects occurred?

I began my MS journey as an adult when I was diagnosed with severe progressive Multiple Sclerosis (MS). As part of treatment, we started using Biotin as one of our first medications because it was proven safe and effective against the disease.

After starting Biotin, my symptoms disappeared completely within 1 year and I started to feel much better. Since then, I've used Biotin daily and it's made a difference in my quality of life. My MS has improved significantly since beginning Biotin, but unfortunately I still suffer from depression, anxiety, fatigue, joint pain and more chronic conditions than before taking Biotin.

My friends, family members and doctors all love Biotin! They say it works so well because it causes blood vessels to contract even faster during periods of intense physical activity. It also helps reduce inflammation, which can be caused by autoimmune diseases like MS.

You can learn more about the benefits of Biotin and its many uses here.

Biotin® (vitamin B3) Dosage: 30 mg orally twice daily (e.g., three times per day), preferably taken on an empty stomach.


In addition to Biotin®, there are two additional types of Biotin-containing medications (vitamins C and E):

Vitamin C

The most commonly prescribed form of vitamin C is given as intravenous injection. This means that you inject the drug into your vein via a catheter placed through a needle inserted into the forearm or leg. Vitamin C is recommended over oral forms of this compound because it will not interfere with absorption from food or water. The drug is available only as an intravenous solution and cannot be ingested whole.

Vitamin E

This form of vitamin E may be given by a single injection into the arm or leg once every 3 months or once every 4 years if a long-term maintenance regimen is being followed. The dosage may be increased gradually, depending upon the individual patient.

""In order for lung cancer to spread,"" said Dr. John C. O'Keefe III, chief medical officer at Cleveland Clinic, ""it must become established in both lungs."" Because it is an advanced form of cancer, there are only two methods for screening for it today: by using biopsy samples from the lung itself (to detect malignant cells) or by measuring the amount of protein in the tissue samples obtained when lung cancer has been detected through other means (such as by imaging techniques). The test used to determine whether someone has lung cancer is known as the Lymphoma Screening Test (LSST), which was first developed in 1968 and is commonly called the lung-cancer screen. If you have had your lung tested recently but do not have symptoms, you can take the LSST just before you go into surgery. A sample will be sent to a laboratory, where it will be analyzed for the presence of lung tumors by a combination of molecular tests. When you return home from surgery and are asked what you ate, you can answer this question honestly, but if you don't remember anything about yesterday's meal, it won't tell much about your risk of developing lung cancer. But even if you know something about your diet, it doesn't mean you're more likely to develop lung cancer than someone who hasn't had their diagnosis yet.

The main reason people with lung cancer get caught earlier is because they live longer. They tend to stay healthy for a while after diagnosis until symptoms emerge, although the average life expectancy for men with lung cancer is 79 years. While many people consider themselves lucky enough to live past 80, researchers believe that it isn't quite true; smoking increases the rate of lung cancer at least fourfold, as does poor nutrition and obesity.",113,asthma and covid,-12.219021797180176,202,q,10,0.9223744292237442,320,3

Surgical options for advanced stages of lung cancers include surgery and radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is often used if there is no cure or remission. Surgery is also available if the patient has a very high risk of relapse. In addition to these treatments, chemotherapy can be an option in most cases. Chemotherapy treatment may be given at any time during cancer treatment. Although chemo is considered safe, it should only be given for patients who have a good prognosis and minimal toxicity. There may be complications associated with chemo treatment; this includes bleeding, gastrointestinal problems, bone marrow failure, and death. If you think your loved one may require chemo, you should discuss the best way to proceed with the consultation with their health care team.

Other Options Treatment options for early stage lung cancer include surgery and radiation therapy. Radiation therapy usually means receiving chemotherapy. This is done either in combination with standard radiotherapy, or alone. You will receive both types of treatment together. A large number of people do not respond well to standard treatment because of side effects such as nausea and vomiting. So some patients receive a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The choice is entirely up to you. However, if chemotherapy isn't an option for your loved one, then they need additional treatment. Some treatments are contraindicated in certain situations, so a physical exam and an evaluation by a physician are recommended before the treatment starts. These examinations involve checking the lungs and blood flow.

What Is Cancer?

What Are Lung Diseases?

Lung diseases include many different conditions including respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine, and neurological disorders. Most lung disease occurs in people with tobacco use, but some conditions occur in people without tobacco smoking. When someone smokes, he or she can become ill from inhaling smoke particles, which could cause inflammation or damage to the lining of the lungs. Other causes for lung disease include things like obesity and diabetes, infections, allergies, viral illnesses, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). People can develop other lung diseases when",117,stage 4 metastatic lung cancer outcome,-1.9392848014831543,22,q,10,0.08870967741935484,405,23
gpt2-large_101,"if you are diagnosed with cancer, there may be a higher chance of developing an aggressive form.

What are the long-term effects?

There is no good data on long-term side effects from CMTs in patients who were previously treated for breast or prostate cancer. However, CMTs can have negative side effects.

In general, these include nausea and vomiting, fatigue, skin changes (such as redness, dryness, itching), hair loss, changes in heart rate, weight gain, changes in blood sugar, and headaches. In some cases, symptoms can last months to years. Many people experience these symptoms within 24 hours after starting treatment. Sometimes these symptoms disappear soon after stopping treatment. Most people who develop them are able to control them without medication or surgery. They do not always occur immediately but can take many months to appear. If they persist, they may require ongoing monitoring by your doctor. For more information about side effects of CMTs, see our page on CMTs.

How is it given?

CMTs should be taken exactly as prescribed by your doctor. You may need to repeat doses every 6 weeks until you feel comfortable. Some people get better quickly; others remain sick for several years because their body's immune system was fighting the disease at that time. It takes time for your body to adjust.

The most common method of giving CMTs is through IV. A syringe needle is placed into your arm and pumped full of medicine through your vein. The drug stays in your bloodstream while you sleep. Your doctor might give you another injection at the same site or use other medicines such as insulin or insulin shots. It can take two to four days for your body to fully adapt. During this time, some side effects can start appearing, including tiredness, blurred vision, nausea, headaches, and sometimes diarrhea. These effects often last less than 10 days before disappearing.

The type of intravenous therapy is important. Different types of therapies work differently and need different amounts of morphine to produce the same results. Certain types of IV treatments are available and are indicated for specific patients. Read each patient's individual instructions carefully so they know how much to expect from their particular treatment plan.

Most women receiving CMTs also receive oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptive pills will prevent pregnancy even if you stop taking CMTs during treatment. Pills must be used for the entire duration of your treatment period.",101,heavy flares swelling lymph nodes,-13.048307418823242,98,q,10,0.7967479674796748,403,0

A: It's best to get your fibre from whole foods such as fruits or vegetables and beans (or meat if you're vegetarian), but even more important than the food itself is how much it contains. Fiber in whole foods like oats can be used in recipes because they have a lot of water and other nutrients; however, these whole foods contain very little fiber. For example, whole grains (gluten-free breads, crackers) have about 10% fibre, while oatmeal has only 3%. Q: I'm lactose intolerant. Is there anything I should avoid for this reason? A: Lactose intolerance may not affect everyone equally, so try to find out what makes you feel better before trying something new! Q: If I've been eating gluten free for a long time, will my symptoms return when I start reintroducing gluten? A: Yes. Your body will likely adapt faster if you eat well with regularity but it might take longer to notice its effects. You could try stopping gluten altogether (if you haven't already) after a period of no gluten consumption for at least four weeks, or just for two months. It is also possible to stop gluten completely by doing nothing on top of the current gluten diet, but you'd probably need to do the following for a minimum of six months: Reduce all processed foods to one serving per day

Take an anti-inflammatory supplement daily

Swallow at least five small handfuls of fresh fruit daily

Eat plenty of lean meats and poultry – especially chicken and turkey Q: How does a gluten free diet work and why would anyone want to change their lifestyle? A: A gluten free diet changes your gut microbiota so the bacteria you consume no longer cause inflammation. This means fewer foods containing gluten and less sensitivity to gluten. The result is a reduction in celiac disease cases, but also a decreased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, obesity and certain types of cancer. Many people who are sensitive to gluten are able to reduce or eliminate their own dietary allergens through a strict diet. Q: My friend says she's never eaten wheat again.

1. Introduction\r

The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is frequently made after a person has been diagnosed with diabetes earlier in life. This may occur if a parent becomes aware that a child is diabetic or if an older sibling learns about his or her condition. In both situations, many parents fear that if they seek treatment for the child, it could lead to complications later in life; such concerns may arise because children who are diagnosed early may have already progressed into adult-type diabetes or because adults with T1D develop diabetes through other means than pregnancy or diabetes. In either case, these fears can cause confusion and delay diagnosis. In addition, there are some people whose prognosis for T1D does not improve when they receive treatment for T2D or treatable forms of noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). This section discusses how T1D is diagnosed, what type of diabetes is present, whether it develops within a period of time following diagnosis, and when it might benefit from medication.\r


2. Diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetic Neuropathy\r

Diabetes results from abnormal glucose levels in the blood.\r

In people who have type 1 diabetes, glucose levels rise and fall with increasing amounts of insulin.\r

According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), normal values for the amount of sugar produced per unit of protein is 2 grams per kilogram of body weight per day; this is approximately 0.6 percent of total calories consumed in the United States and 5 percent of caloric intake from carbohydrates (5). For comparison, the average body mass index (BMI) for men is 25.0 to 29.9.\r

Type 1 diabetes also occurs in those individuals with type 2 diabetes. A person with type 2 diabetes is usually younger than 30 years",45,Can diabetes be cured?,-0.4950681924819946,29,q,10,0.23015873015873015,384,15

10-12. PREDICTION OF THE AGE OF MENopause \/ nIn the late 20th century, many people believed that menopause could last as long as age. However, there has been little scientific evidence to support this notion. This section discusses some of the factors associated with this uncertainty. As mentioned above, studies show that the average life expectancy for women has increased by about 10 years since 1900. Most researchers now believe that this increase is due primarily to improved medical care, and that the longer women live, the more likely they will develop endometriosis.

13-15. PRECIPITATION OF THE FERTILITY SYSTEM \/ nAn overactive, immature ovarian follicle (hypovolemic) indicates decreased production of estrogen and may lead to early ovarian failure. The follicular phase can be shortened if the patient is treated with progestins during their menstrual cycle. If she is not exposed to progesterone, then her total period begins early in her menstrual cycle (after ovulation). In addition, women taking oral contraceptives have had a marked reduction in ovulation, which makes it difficult to predict when the next time period will occur.

16-18. CANCER WARNING SIGNS \/ nAs a result of the introduction of various vaccines into our country in the 20th century, we became aware of several types of cancer that were particularly dangerous to infants born prematurely. For example, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, shingles, hepatitis B virus, and Hepatitis C have all caused serious complications to babies and young children. Although most of these cancers were cured with anticancer drugs such as penicillin and tetracycline, in the case of some of them—such as Hepatitis B—",126,birth control suppression antral follicle count,-11.16361141204834,31,q,10,0.26495726495726496,330,1

A review of the available data also suggests that women may be more likely than men to report symptoms, such as coughing or wheezing after a fall. In one study of 1,000 people in Japan, researchers found that about two-thirds of women reported some type of cough during a typical work week compared with just over half of men (69% versus 46%). The prevalence of these coughs ranged from 16% for those who worked long hours to 19% for those who spent less time on the job. There were no differences between women and men regarding the frequency or severity of cough episodes. Overall, the researchers concluded that ""women are at greater risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD].""

Women have also been shown to suffer more severe bronchitis than their male counterparts, which is linked to both increased duration of illness and the likelihood of hospitalization. In one recent Canadian study, a total of 667 adults aged 65 years and older were surveyed on the nature and extent of their bronchitis. Among smokers, 576 individuals reported having an episode of shortness of breath per month, while only 3.5% of nonsmokers had this issue. For nonsmokers, the rate was lower—1.7% for all participants. About one quarter of each group reported having episodes lasting 10 days or longer, whereas 4.8% of the smokers did so. As well, women's rates were significantly higher than men's. Smoking rates among men were 15.2%, but only 8% of women were smokers.

In another large study from Finland, researchers examined the relationship between smoking habits and COPD. They studied 2,100 adults of varying ages living in northern Europe between 1979 and 1999. During the follow up period, 713 cases were identified; 928 were diagnosed with COCD, including about 600 cases of acute exacerbation followed by exacerbations lasting several weeks to months.

gpt2-large_83,"You might be asking yourself the question why am I trying to find out. Well, let me back up for you.

I'm not sure if this is going to help or hurt but here goes nothing: I am on my second round of chemo right now and I have found that it has started to affect my sleep. When I wake up I immediately feel like crap (which is normal for a lot of people) so I need to take care of myself to avoid getting depressed at the thought of waking up with fatigue and having an excuse to eat cereal again.

So when I was in the middle of this whole ""depression"" thing I would go through a phase where I would think about how much better things were before cancer. This will happen to many people who are depressed because they're dealing with life without their loved ones around them, and it can make things worse when you feel completely alone. As much as it sucks to be depressed it also feels pretty good to know that there's someone there for you. It allows you to forget all of the negative feelings that come along with your diagnosis which actually makes everything easier.

Anyway, here is what happened. About a month ago I was feeling really sick and tired, but then this morning I went into a panic attack over something stupid like having no money. My boyfriend was driving me home because he doesn't want me staying over and I was already feeling awful so I just took the bus, got off at the grocery store, and drove him home anyway. After we got home I did some thinking and realized that perhaps what I had been eating was poisoning me. So I decided to do a little research. Turns out I have MS, but I've never had a serious problem with any kind of food or drink before, other than maybe a few beers. And I don't even remember eating anything until about 5 days after being diagnosed, so I have to assume it wasn't the case. So I read a few books online and checked out various websites about MS and tried several different things. Nothing worked. The only thing that seemed to work was taking in high-fructose corn syrup or sugar drinks, but once those foods became very common I quickly lost interest. So it looked like one thing I could try was a low-carbohydrate diet. Now, while this may seem like a crazy idea, I love my pancakes and don't see anything wrong with my usual breakfast of eggs over toast and bacon, or eggs with sausage gravy or mashed potatoes.

The results showed no significant difference in the overall survival times of patients receiving either treatment group, with a median survival time of 19 days and 24 days for those treated with 1 dose of radiation versus those treated with 2 doses. In addition, while the number of cancers increased in both groups over time, only two cases were observed at 3 months after the first dose.

""The clinical findings from our study are reassuring. These data have important implications for radiation therapy providers who choose to use higher-dose radiation,"" said Dr. David S. Kopp, MD, assistant professor of dermatology at the University of Minnesota College of Medicine and lead author on the study. ""These findings also provide reassurance that the risks associated with high-dose radiation exposure are not as serious as commonly thought.""

A growing body of evidence has shown that certain types of radiation cause DNA damage, which can accelerate aging, causing increased risk for cancer. However, most studies using randomized controlled trials have failed to show any benefit from treating these cancers with higher-dose radiation.

Although this is the largest study evaluating different treatments for breast cancer and other cancers combined, it did not find any definitive advantage of radiation compared to standard therapies such as surgery or chemotherapy. One limitation was that participants were randomly assigned to receive radiation or control, so there is still the possibility that the effects seen could be due to chance.

In addition, the researchers studied multiple types of cancer, including solid tumors and blood and lymphatic tumors (T-cell lymphoma), but they did not compare them to each other because some types of cancers may be more sensitive to radiation than others. Nevertheless, many medical experts believe that cancer patients should seek out all available treatment options when considering treatment recommendations, regardless of their diagnosis.",118,stage 4 triple negative breast cancer treatment,-11.656185150146484,125,no_prompt,1,0.5605381165919282,305,6

But when a child needs more than just sleep, sometimes it is best to go for another dose of medication.

In a study published last year in Pediatrics, researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine looked into whether parents who were concerned about their children's sleep would opt for prescription sleeping pills over placebo pills, which are not proven to help with sleep problems. The researchers found that even if parents did want to take some medicine, they weren't willing to do so because of concerns such as side effects or the belief that taking these drugs might cause them to forget how good their kids' sleep was.

""The bottom line is that we don't have enough evidence right now to be able to recommend this approach,"" Dr. Arden says. Even though there is no evidence showing that these medications really work against chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), he adds, patients should still talk to doctors before starting one.

Some experts feel that sleep research has been skewed by pharmaceutical companies. For example, most studies looking at ADHD and other attention-deficit disorders have focused only on young people. But many recent studies also show that childhood infections may make it harder for adults to fall asleep and sleep through the night. Studies also suggest that children who live in homes where their mother worked all day can suffer from disrupted sleep.

Still, Dr. Rosenfeld points out that it is possible that sleep issues arise due to other factors — like stressful life events — rather than the influence of medication. And even if medication doesn't fix everything, he says, ""it could reduce stress and allow us to get better.""",105,wisdom tooth cuts gum pain,-14.432703018188477,78,no_prompt,1,0.9873417721518988,317,0

gpt2-large_35,"A: It is possible to reduce the insulin levels of blood glucose and thereby improve glycemic control. In particular, it is possible to increase hepatic glucose production by increasing pancreatic enzymes or by augmenting liver glycogen stores (see below). This can be done in two ways: 1) decrease the amount of fat ingested during fasting; 2) increase carbohydrate intake. Both strategies are available for type I diabetics with an impaired ability to store carbohydrates because they are hyperinsulinemic. If you eat low-carbohydrate diets, your body will produce more fatty acids from nonesterified fatty acids and less insulin. As a result, when insulin levels are reduced through dietary restriction or increased via pharmacologic manipulation, blood sugar tends to come down and blood sugar control improves significantly.[1] However, this does not mean that patients with type II diabetes will lose weight if their diabetic blood sugars drop due to dietary change. Insulin resistance remains the main cause of obesity, so weight loss may not be achieved even under strict diabetes management guidelines[2]. Many other factors, such as physical activity, genetics, lifestyle changes, and medications also affect metabolic health. The best approach depends on individual circumstances. For example, some individuals with Type II diabetes have little risk of developing severe complications such as myocardial infarction from a high blood pressure resulting from long-term uncontrolled hypertension or type I diabetes mellitus after lifestyle modifications [3]. On the other hand, others may develop severe complications such as renal failure or cardiovascular disease with diabetes alone. Therefore, there are no perfect guidelines regarding dietary intervention for people with type II diabetes. Some studies report that replacing a higher carbohydrate diet with a lower carbohydrate diet results in better glycemic control and improved lipid profiles despite similar weight loss and energy expenditure. It is important to note that many of these studies were performed in obese subjects without knowledge about diabetic complications. In the same way, some studies suggest that persons with type II diabetes who follow a strict carbohydrate diet for 8 weeks have lower rates of coronary heart disease, stroke, and kidney stones than those who follow a very low carbohydrate diet. These findings, however, should be interpreted carefully as their small sample size, lack of control over all variables besides dietary intake, and use of only one outcome measure do not necessarily indicate causality between dietary changes and outcomes. A few studies have shown improvement in serum lipids among subjects following a low carbohydrate diet compared to subjects following a very low carbohydrate diet. However, most of these studies did not include measures of abdominal fat mass",35,Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?,-9.15453052520752,62,no_prompt,1,0.4,433,28

The relationship between exercise and depression has received considerable attention in the past. Indeed, there is compelling evidence that moderate-intensity aerobic fitness can reduce symptoms of major depressive disorder, although it does not appear to affect response rates to antidepressant medications (Welsh et al., 2006; Stokes et al., 2011a; D'Elia et al., 2013). In addition, a large body of research suggests an inverse association between aerobic fitness levels and suicidal thoughts and behaviour (D'Elia et al., 2012), suggesting that exercising at higher intensities may have some protective effect against suicide attempts. However, other studies indicate that there is little evidence that increased levels of physical activity decrease suicide risk among persons who have been diagnosed as depressed or treated for depression (Stokes et al., 2011b; Leitner et al., 2014), whereas others suggest that there is a causal relationship (Faraone et al., 2009). As such, it is important to understand the extent to which increased physical activity reduces depressive symptoms, given that depressed individuals may also experience significant psychological distress related to their mental health problems, especially if they engage in self-harm behaviours such as cutting (Kossoff, 1991; DeVries & Brown, 2008; MacGregor & Blumstein, 2010) or substance abuse (Leitner et al., 2014).

The current study aimed to examine how changes in physical activity status during follow-up varied by gender within patients with recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD) who had participated in a 12-month randomized controlled trial of medication treatment (NCT01507732; MSC/1J002566). Specifically, we measured both physiological measures of aerobic fitness and mental state when participants returned for posttreatment evaluation. We hypothesized that the presence of greater change over time in aerobic fitness would predict better responses to depression treatment and mental health outcomes after six months' follow up compared to baseline.

A few months ago I was in my 20s with mild acne on my upper lip that had been going away for several years. Over time I stopped eating too much sugar, drank lots of water, took probiotics, tried things like dietitians' creams and tonics (which only worked for about half the people who received them), etc., but I still had occasional breakout after weeks of doing nothing. And the only thing that seemed to help was using an anti-inflammatory called ibuprofen—because it's so gentle and effective against inflammation. After four days of taking this daily at first, I started noticing a change in my skin tone: the breakouts were less frequent, more even in color, and seemed less severe.

I decided to see if anyone else would benefit from an ibuprofen-based regimen, as I didn't have any symptoms of active eczema and no problems with my digestive tract. A couple of others responded favorably to the treatment.

The next day, I got up early and headed out for a run. At the end of our run we met up with another runner, both of whom had also noticed improvement in their skin. This was followed shortly thereafter by another runner with mild eczema who said she'd been suffering since her teens—probably because she ate poorly and got overactive stomach acid that caused an upset gut. She told me that a few days before I gave her ibuprofen, she'd been having great skin during running because she'd eaten better and exercised frequently. That night, she woke up feeling awful and went to bed exhausted, worried she might be having food poisoning. The following morning, though, her skin looked better than it had ever done! When I asked what happened to her skin, she said, ""It changed overnight!""

What happened here wasn't an isolated case of improvement. In many cases, getting more rigorous results simply means finding a regimen with fewer side effects.

Women who have a history of maternal mortality are more likely to die during pregnancy than women without such an exposure, and the odds of death increase with decreasing gestational age (6). The risk of miscarriage decreases with increasing duration of labor, which is why most clinicians recommend early induction of labor for all patients at ≤37 weeks' gestation or older; these recommendations remain unchanged after adjusting for other obstetric variables (7, 8), including parity.

Although spontaneous abortion can be induced by any means available to the pregnant woman, some physicians use local anesthesia, mechanical forceps, electrocautery, or vacuum aspiration to deliver the fetus within 24 hours of its birth (9–11); others use ultrasound imaging or laparoscopic extraction of the embryo (12, 13) or direct injection into the uterus. In clinical practice, only a small proportion of women opt for delivery using either method (14). However, many women choose not to deliver their pregnancies via traditional methods because they view abortion as a morally wrong act that should be avoided. It has been estimated that about 15% of women who experience a termination of pregnancy experience some regret regarding the decision to terminate their pregnancy (15). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists defines ""irreversible"" as ""permanent or irreversible loss of fetal viability,"" whereas ""indefinite"" refers to ""loss of fetal development."" A retrospective study of 1,000 first-trimester terminations reported a rate of 3.5% (16). In addition to the legal consequences of a termination of pregnancy, there are potential psychological risks associated with abortion (17). For example, women who live near abortion clinics may experience emotional distress related to being close to those facilities. Another issue facing medical providers is the stigma associated with abortions, with some individuals feeling stigmatized if they do not consider themselves prolife or having an abortion. Patients often report difficulty accessing the services needed when they need them, even though health insurance covers these services (18–20).

In this study, we assessed whether abortion was associated with decreased rates of long-term physical and mental well-being among reproductive-aged women residing in the Atlanta area. We hypothesized that women would be less physically and mentally healthy if they were provided free medical care for their abortions.

gpt2-large_63,"A: Multiple Sclerosis can cause disability and even death, but the chances of it affecting your job or career are extremely rare. There is a greater chance that you will experience any of these health issues than you do of developing MS. The risk is based on the type of disease and how quickly it progresses. It does not affect your ability to perform tasks normally performed by others in the workplace, such as driving a vehicle. If an employee develops MS, his or her job may be affected. But it usually takes a few years for symptoms to appear. If symptoms become severe enough, an individual may need hospitalization and ongoing care. Many people with MS feel less capable of performing daily activities because they cannot function at their normal pace. So if symptoms continue after treatment, work with your employer's medical team to find ways to reduce workload or increase productivity. You should also seek advice from a health insurance plan about coverage options and payment rates for care and treatments.


Q: What are some things I should consider before starting MS Therapy?

A: Before beginning treatment, talk to your doctor about what you want, or would like to receive, during therapy. Ask questions about safety precautions and side effects, including medication dosage. Keep track of results and discuss them with your doctor regularly throughout treatment. Discuss with your doctor whether you have other health problems, such as heart, lung, kidney, thyroid, neurological or mental disorders, diabetes or other illnesses. Talk to your doctor about any medical conditions that might make it difficult to take medications or therapies appropriately or safely. Your doctor may suggest alternative medicine or follow-up treatment. You should tell your doctor about any new medications or supplements you use and explain why they are helpful. Also ask your doctor about any changes or complications to your medications or treatments over time. A good general idea is to avoid taking medicines longer than recommended. And please see your doctor if any of the following apply: You begin taking medicines or supplements late;

You notice a change in your mental state, physical condition or behavior;

Your vision becomes blurry or darkens;

You get headaches (especially during pregnancy);

You have trouble sleeping (particularly while breastfeeding);

You develop numbness, tingling or weakness around the eyes, hand or foot; or

There is discomfort or weakness when swallowing. In addition, check with your doctor before using herbal products or supplements.

Painless, irregular swelling that may be more like a cold than a fever

When to see a doctor

Painful swollen lymph nodes on one side of your neck or back

Swelling around the eyes, mouth and chin

Chest pain

Headache

If these signs and symptoms last for longer than two weeks, seek urgent medical attention. This includes if they affect your vision, speech or mental functions.

Causes

Multiple sclerosis happens when a type of immune system called T cell is unable to fight off harmful bacteria, viruses and fungi (antibiotics). These infections are called opportunistic pathogens, which can cause inflammation and damage tissue throughout the body.

T cells make antibodies to protect against infections. But their levels drop when a person has a weakened immune system because of age, organ transplantation, cancer, radiation therapy or other diseases.

This decline in T cell function triggers an immune response that can trigger MS.

Risk factors

Factors known to increase risk of developing MS include:

Age

Being born after 1990 or having older parents

Having diabetes

Having had surgery before age 25, or

Having smoked during adolescence or adulthood

Complications

Although many people recover from MS, there's no cure, and people do need treatment.

gpt2-large_51,"The term holistic medicine has been used by many different organizations to refer to the medical system, but there are two major definitions of the word. The first definition (the official one) focuses on the individual's own health as a whole, instead of just the treatments that he or she takes. This definition says that individuals can be healthy in their own right without any specific treatment being required. For example, someone could consider taking vitamins every day and improving his or her blood pressure with an anti-hypertensive drug. On the other hand, holistic doctors may prescribe various forms of drugs that might increase pain relief, improve circulation, reduce symptoms, ease menstrual cramps and help manage weight loss.

The second definition of the word refers to treating an entire group of people individually and not necessarily as a group. A third category, called holistic care, includes all types of treatments that focus on the individual patient, including medications, home remedies, acupuncture, chiropractic, massage, nutrition and exercise.

Healthy vs. Unhealthy Patients

There are several ways to define healthy versus unhealthy patients. There is no consensus as to which way is better, however some researchers say that the more severe the illness or injury, the less likely the person will be considered healthy. In cases such as diabetes, obesity or cancer, these illnesses or injuries do have an impact on the body's ability to function at its best level. As long as they don't cause life-threatening problems, then the individual should receive proper medical attention even if he or she seems unwell. If you suspect your child may have autism or schizophrenia, talk to them about a mental health evaluation before you take him or her off medication. However, be aware that the same cannot be said for ADHD; unless the diagnosis of the disorder is well established, it's possible that the child won't develop into a normal teenager, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. So please make sure you get checked out so that you know what the risks and benefits are.

How Does It Work?

When it comes to helping people improve their physical and mental health through natural methods, some experts believe that it's almost impossible to overdo it. Instead of trying to cure everything at once, we need to start with small steps, starting with simple things like eating better and exercising. Once you're comfortable with how your body reacts to certain foods and exercises, you can move onto adding supplements and herbal teas. But only after you've tried both traditional medicine and holistic",51,What is holistic medicine and what does it include?,-0.0496460162103176,2,no_prompt,1,0.0106951871657754,428,24
gpt2-large_114,". Although there is a wide range of diagnostic criteria for the disorder, it is important to note that some individuals may only have one or two symptoms and may not meet all requirements for an IPD diagnosis (Baker et al., 2002). Furthermore, although there are numerous different criteria available for distinguishing between ADHD and other forms of childhood behavior disorders, none of them will exclude those with the DSM-IV Diagnostic Criteria for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) from participation in the study.

There are many limitations inherent in this study that should be considered when interpreting results. The findings need to be replicated in larger samples with greater statistical power to achieve the same conclusions. It was necessary to recruit a sample that included children aged 6–12 years because the current study used data collected from families based on parental reports rather than clinical observations (i.e., the clinician's report). We also relied on parents' self-reported diagnoses for those children who did not receive a formal diagnosis at the time of recruitment. As such, we were unable to confirm whether all children had received these diagnoses during their childhoods; however, considering the fact that they would most likely have been diagnosed by age 4 and 5, we believe our findings represent the best estimate of what would be expected if all children met these diagnoses. In addition, because the sample size was small, we could only analyze three measures of attention deficit/hyperactivity: (1) a test of verbal memory; (2) a measure of hyperactive behavior; and (3) a measure of impulsivity/impulsivity. Because parents can be biased toward reporting higher levels of child behaviors such as hyperactivity if they perceive that their child has more problems, a secondary analysis of each measure was conducted using parent reports. However, given the nature of the studies design, such analyses cannot completely rule out the possibility that children with higher scores of hyperactive behaviors and less attention deficits may simply be overreporting their own behaviors. Also, it must be noted that although both the parents' and the researchers' reports contained information about the individual child (such as name, sex, race, birth year, etc.), there is no way to know how much of this information reflects actual knowledge of the child's experience with ADHD compared with parents' reports. Finally, the current study examined the effects of age on symptom severity, but it is possible that older children might be more severely affected than younger ones. To address this question, future research should examine the effects of the timing of exposure to ADHD",114,borderline personality disorder symptoms,-13.06755828857422,106,no_prompt,1,0.9814814814814815,426,2

The new data shows the percentage of MS cases that were treated with a neuroleptic or other non-medically prescribed drug, which included at least one benzodiazepine, was twice as high among people who received placebo than it was in those who got none. Overall, about 5% of all MS cases between 2002 and 2011 required medical care from doctors—but only 2.6% were given an anti-depressant, according to the study published online this week by JAMA Neurology. That means more than 80% of MS patients had access to drugs that would not have been approved by the FDA for use on humans.

""What we found is that this problem is much worse among people who are older,"" said lead author Dr. Gary Greenberg, director of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's Multiple Sclerosis Program. ""As you get older, it becomes increasingly important to be able to control your medication dosage."" This is especially true for patients with MS because they tend to have higher rates of relapse and disability than younger people do. The researchers also found that older people are less likely to take their meds when they might be better off taking them now.

MS is characterized by damage to the brain's white matter—the connective tissue in the brain that controls memory, movement, thought, emotions, and mood. There are two main types: relapsing and progressive forms. In some people, MS can progress into both type 1 and type 2—a third form known as chronic demyelinating disease. People who have progressive MS often fail to respond to current therapies because these medicines don't slow the progression of MS.

In the JAMA study, researchers looked at data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which tracks prescriptions filled by prescribers between 1997 and 2009 for prescription medications used in MS. Of the 993,000 MS patients who were tracked over that period, 3,865 had no medicine prescriptions. For the remaining 723,000 prescriptions filled, 471 were prescribed with antidepressants; 397 prescriptions were for sedatives like alcohol; and 25 for antipsychotic agents such as Zyprexa and Risperdal.

When analyzed separately by age group, the results showed that in addition to more frequent usage, older adults who took antidepressant meds were 50% more likely to receive anti-depressants (as well",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-4.868200778961182,105,no_prompt,1,0.5329949238578681,390,5

The authors of the paper say that the work is ""an important first step to explore the clinical implications"" of a novel group of drugs called autologous thyroid hormone therapy (ATTH). ATTH, which involves injecting patients with their own T3, may offer more benefits than current treatments for treating hypothyroidism, they write, because it might provide better protection against autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis.

Researchers in China recently reported that patients treated with ATTH experienced significantly improved survival rates after their disease returned. And in an earlier study, Chinese researchers found that patients who were given at least eight months' worth of T4 injections had lower blood pressure and blood sugar levels compared with those whose doctors prescribed only one or two daily doses.",123,hypothyroidism symptoms,-11.280417442321776,117,no_prompt,1,0.7222222222222222,127,0

A review of the literature on treatment for ADHD indicates that ADHD medications can be effective in treating many types of ADHD symptoms, but the benefits may not last. Most of these drugs are generally more difficult to quit than is usual with other psychiatric illnesses. For this reason, most professionals recommend a gradual reduction in dosage and frequency over time. This type of approach also helps avoid unnecessary adverse effects from higher doses or longer durations of therapy. However, there are some studies showing that long-term use of ADHD medications such as Ritalin and Adderall has adverse effects, including seizures and weight gain. Since it takes several years for all medications to show their effectiveness, a patient should begin taking only one at a time, preferably one medication at a time. Some experts say that long-term therapy with an ADHD medication can lead to a worse outcome when compared to starting short courses of psychotherapy. Although they do have limited data on the risk of developing long-term problems, the results from this study were promising. In fact, even though this study did not include patients who had never taken stimulant medication before starting the study, those who took the new medication experienced greater improvements than those who received either short or medium treatment periods. Additionally, although this study was a small pilot design, its conclusions about the benefit of stimulants was consistent with previous research done by other researchers. These findings suggest that using a low dose of stimulant drug (such as Ritalin) during a typical therapeutic intervention can produce significant improvements in ADHD symptoms without increasing the risk of adverse side effects. The risks of stimulant medication must also be considered carefully if the patient's doctor prescribes high dosages. Some doctors believe that excessive consumption of stimulant medication has negative consequences, including increased blood pressure, liver damage, and diabetes mellitus.

gpt2-large_55,"There are several methods of managing MS, and they all involve different aspects. If you're not sure what the best course for your condition is, it can be helpful to refer back to our list of suggestions and try them out before making a decision about which method works best for you. This way, you will have more confidence in your choice as a treatment and avoid any unnecessary frustration when choosing the right treatments.

For some people with MS, there isn't a particular doctor or specialist that can offer all the care you need. In order to find one who can help you, you'll want to first decide if you want your medication adjusted, or made less effective. You may also want to consult with other medical professionals to see if there's an alternative plan available. It's important to remember that your healthcare provider should not replace your neurologist or psychologist, but rather work together to provide all the appropriate care you need to live well.

If you do decide to use a different approach, we recommend you talk with your family physician about how to handle adjusting the medications you've been taking. Depending on the severity of your symptoms, the person you're seeing could determine whether you should receive a different dose of medicine or a change in the type of therapy you receive. You may need to talk to your health insurance company too; many companies require this type of information from you prior to granting coverage for medication adjustments.

What if I don't like my current medications? Can I switch to another regimen?

You're always free to choose a new regimen of prescription medicines at any time, but if you don't like the changes or side effects of the medications you already take, it's likely that you won't tolerate them anymore. Your provider has the power to modify your existing medications so that they meet your needs without risking adverse reactions. This means that you don't have to wait until your symptoms become worse before deciding to go with a new medication. If you're interested in switching medications quickly, you may wish to consider changing your prescription once every six months. The sooner you start, however, the better chance you have of getting relief quickly after the initial adjustment period.

Can I continue to take a different regimen of prescribed medications while transitioning to a different treatment option?

While most people prefer to transition gradually to a new treatment option, sometimes medications are needed just to keep things going smoothly when transitioning to that option. For example, you might be using certain medications for a long time and then feel better when taking",55,How to manage multiple sclerosis?,-0.106631338596344,8,no_prompt,1,0.032520325203252036,447,27

The new system uses three different types of photonic crystals that function similarly to each other, with one crystal being sensitive to red light and another to blue or green light, but only when placed in front of a camera. To achieve this, a thin film of the blue light absorber material has been deposited on top of the red glass. When the camera detects an object, it modifies its image accordingly.

Mucosal Immunoregulation: A Unique Mechanism for Disease

A study by the University of Rochester Medical Center, presented at the 2015 Annual Meeting of the American College of Rheumatology, reported that MUC3 is a novel factor in MS and PD. The researchers found that MUC3 was required to reduce inflammation and to induce protection against inflammatory-induced neurological abnormalities such as demyelination and axonal degeneration, suggesting that MUC3 plays an important role in disease.

""We have discovered that MUC3 protects against inflammation in both patients with MS and patients with PD,"" said Dr. Shanna Pincus, lead author on the paper and a researcher at the Department of Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. ""This discovery could be potentially useful to develop therapies aimed at reducing inflammation in the brain.""

In studies involving mice, one group received intravenous injections of immunoglobulin G (IgG) into the central nervous system (CNS), and another group received a saline injection after an overnight fast. Both groups were given multiple doses of MUC3 prior to or following treatments. After eight weeks, the mice receiving Iglo-IgG had significantly lower levels of TNF-α and IL-6 compared to those injected with saline, while the mice receiving MUC3 had no significant difference.

Researchers believe this finding could also provide insight into how Iglo-IgG can protect against autoimmune diseases.

Immunotherapy: A Novel Approach to Treating Autoimmune Diseases

Dr. Pincus' research team has developed new ways to activate the immune system using natural products, such as Mucin, which are produced naturally within the body. These compounds may be used to treat immune disorders, including autoimmune diseases, and other chronic illnesses such as rheumatism and asthma.

""It's been known for many years that certain nutrients, like vitamin D, are associated with reduced risk for autoimmune diseases,"" explained Dr. Pincus. ""And there have long been efforts to identify nutritional triggers that trigger these responses, but it wasn't clear if they all worked together and if some had to do with each other.""

Dr. Pincus and her colleagues were able to demonstrate that two different dietary supplements—Pyridoxine hydrochloride and Caffeic Acid—work together to regulate cytokines, factors involved in regulating immune",92,causes of fatigue in MS,-12.065016746520996,123,no_prompt,1,0.5491071428571429,360,17

I went from a BMI of 27.7 to 25.6 with a 5% drop in waist circumference. This meant that I lost over 10 lbs in just 6 months – not bad at all! My body composition has remained the same too so this is definitely something you can do yourself! Just be sure to keep your carbs low by avoiding processed foods and refined sugars like soda and sweetened drinks.

2) Exercise: How much?

In case you're wondering, my exercise routine consisted of walking, jogging, and running at least 30 minutes per week. As mentioned above, I started out with 30 minutes of jogging each day but gradually increased it up to an hour. However, after only 6 weeks I felt that my daily workout schedule had become boring and the longer I did it, the more fatigue I got which led me to cut back on it considerably. After 7 weeks of doing 1-hour long workouts every night (which included jogging), I decided that it was time to give it another try.

3) Vitamin C: How much?

The vitamin C provided by milk and dark leafy vegetables is usually very high because of the antioxidants they contain. The more antioxidant power these foods have, the better. For example, if I eat 100 grams of raw dark green vegetables as part of my diet (and thus get plenty of antioxidants from them) then I'm likely going to feel better than someone who eats only 80 g of fresh broccoli.

However, before I made any changes, I would take a supplement or two before bedtime. Then I'd make a cup of tea and relax as usual. A study showed that people who consumed 500 mg of vitamin C each day were found to report less insomnia, feeling sleepy during the day, and having lower blood pressure when compared to those who didn't consume the vitamin. I believe that this may account for some of the improvements I've experienced since starting the diet.

4) Fruits: What's good/bad about fruits?

Fruit is one of the most nutrient dense fruits and there are many different types and varieties. Some fruit have antioxidants added to them such as citrus juice, cranberry, pineapple, grapefruit, etc. Others don't have any added benefits or simply aren't as nutritious. So what's best?

Here's a breakdown of fruits into categories based on their nutritional value:

In other cases of MS, however, it has been shown that patients with the diagnosis are more likely to report significant improvements in their disability (from the time before treatment), suggesting the possibility that self-reported MS may be an appropriate outcome measure for this group.[3][4] Studies have also demonstrated that patients are more accurate in reporting their current condition compared to non-MS individuals. These studies may support the use of the MS Disease Status Questionnaire in clinical practice.

Anatomy

The main component of MS is a chronic inflammatory process of the central nervous system known as Lewy body dementia (LBD). It affects approximately 1% to 4% of all people with MS, although its prevalence varies greatly across countries, from 3.5% to 26%. Individuals with MS typically exhibit early signs and symptoms that can progress over years, though some symptoms persist after the initial onset of the disease. LBD often involves loss of balance and coordination, progressive muscle weakness, vision impairment, cognitive decline, pain, fatigue, and skin rashes or ulcers. The physical features associated with MS may include diffuse white spots on the brain, neurofibromas (spots), or ataxia. Some people develop neurological and psychiatric symptoms that may last several months following the first relapse of the illness. Other people will never experience any symptoms. In most cases, people with MS eventually recover completely from the disease; there are currently no treatments for this type of MS.


Clinical Features

Possible Diagnosis: Although LBD usually presents as distinct abnormalities, it could sometimes present as one or two distinct diseases. Therefore, when determining if someone is suffering from MS, we recommend that you review your family history, including medical information (including laboratory results), including testing for autoimmune disorders and other conditions. If you suspect that someone you know has MS, tell them about your disease status and ask them how they feel about it. They should then discuss possible diagnoses in terms of severity (progressive, milder forms) and prognosis (how soon they'll regain full function) with their doctor. They should consider whether they want to get help or need alternative therapies or medications. In addition, we encourage you to provide them with information about potential treatment options, such as vaccines and lifestyle changes.

gpt2-large_86,"(PMS) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects approximately 7.5 million people worldwide. MS is characterized by the destruction of nerve cells, called myelin sheaths. Damage to these myelinated fibers can cause physical symptoms like weakness and numbness on one side of your body.

However, there are other factors that contribute to MS onset as well. A study published in January 2017 found that individuals with MS tend to be more likely than others to have two major risk factors for developing the disease: having an inherited trait (such as Down syndrome or Trisomy 18) and being overweight or obese. Another reason may be related to higher levels of ""risk genes"" associated with Alzheimer's. These include APP, tau and phospho-tau proteins. The research also shows that individuals who score low on several indicators of cognitive function (including memory loss) are at greater risk for developing MS compared to those with higher scores.

The National Institutes of Health, which funds the NIH-funded clinical trials, conducted its first clinical trial comparing the effects of folic acid supplementation against placebo treatment on cognition among patients with mild-to-moderate cases of MS. For this pilot trial, researchers randomly assigned 16 healthy young adults ages 18 to 40 years to receive either a combination of folic acid plus vitamin B12 (300 micrograms daily) or placebo; participants were followed until their cognitive decline stopped. Results showed that both groups had similar improvements in measures of executive functioning — including planning, problem solving, attention and verbal ability, compared to baseline measurements after just one year. But while the total number of participants was slightly smaller than in previous studies, the overall rate of change was significantly greater.

In a recent paper in Neurology, researchers from The Scripps Research Institute examined how various antioxidants might help prevent or treat MS. Specifically, they focused on the role played by antioxidants such as vitamins C and E. In addition, they noted potential benefits of antioxidant supplements — especially beta carotene — in reducing inflammation and improving oxidative stress. One thing that was not addressed in the study? Age. It wasn't clear whether antioxidant supplementation would benefit older participants.

One explanation could lie within the brain itself. A 2014 study published in the journal Neurobiology of Aging suggested that aging is linked to increased cell death throughout the human nervous system. This means it's possible that long-term use of antioxidant supplements during old age could help reduce certain forms of dementia.

This hypothesis is supported in another study published",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-9.450591087341309,94,no_prompt,1,0.706766917293233,416,0

Q: Do you believe MS patients have more trouble recalling recent events than healthy individuals do? Is that true or just an illusion?

A: There's no doubt about it; MS patients are significantly less able to recall previous events than the general population. They also report difficulty remembering important details from prior experiences such as seeing a doctor, going on vacation or watching television.

Q: Are there differences between women and men with MS? What causes them?

A: Not every woman is affected equally by MS, so we cannot say for sure whether women have different symptoms. However, there is reason to think that women tend to be more depressed, which may contribute to their lower response rates to treatment. On the other hand, some studies suggest that women with MS are better at learning new skills, including memory.

Q: Why does MS occur when the immune system seems to function well? How do we explain this?

A: The immune system plays a vital role during disease initiation, progression, and recovery. During illness, cells called microglia (neurons) migrate into the brain to help fight infection and stimulate regeneration of damaged tissue. But when the immune system goes awry, neurons die and immune system cells multiply uncontrollably, triggering inflammation. This leads to damage to myelin -- protective coatings that insulate nerve fibers -- and eventually leads to the destruction of synapses (connective tissue).",93,Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?,-0.0636275485157966,2,no_prompt,1,0.010101010101010102,256,17
gpt2-large_72,"A study of a new vaccine to prevent the disease suggested that it may not be as safe or effective in treating patients who already take MS drugs, according to the results published this week in The Lancet.

The researchers from Cardiff University's School of Medical Sciences used a trial that they carried out at the University Hospital of Wales and the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust (RMNHS) in London. They found that individuals with MS who were given two doses of the vaccine had higher rates of adverse events than those who received no immunisation at all – up to nine times greater risks compared with those receiving one dose. This is thought to be because the immune system in these patients has been weakened by the drugs.

But there was an exception: one third of those with one dose of the vaccine survived longer if their drug therapy ended sooner, which suggests there is still some protection against MS after vaccination. However, the risk of severe side effects was three times greater among those on only one dose than among those receiving none. Researchers say more research will be needed before the vaccine can be recommended in most cases.

""People have been taking MS drugs for many years without any problems. If you give them a booster shot, chances are very good that there is going to be a rebound,"" said Professor Chris McAllister, senior author of the study and a GP at Cardiff Health. ""It could be the case that there is enough protective immunity left to last several decades."" He added that while there has not yet been evidence of long term complications, this is not known because of the small number of patients involved.

Prof McAllister also pointed out that people should get two doses of the MMR vaccine, rather than just one, so it is possible that it might protect them from MS for a few additional years. ""If someone has two vaccines, then it is worth getting four, but if they have only one, then maybe it does not matter whether there are extra injections,"" he said.

He noted that there is increasing concern over the potential dangers of having high levels of antibodies to both measles, mumps and rubella, or CMV, which was recently identified in a large study. It causes inflammation within the body that can cause rashes, fever and headaches. There have been recent reports that children with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have had CMV antibodies in their blood, raising questions about how much this may increase the chance of developing the condition.

If one parent is not a resident or the child has moved out of state before the other parent is able to be present for the hearing, then the spouse in the relationship with the child may petition on behalf of the child. If the children are siblings or cousins, their parents will need to attend the hearing as well as get to know each other better before filing this petition (it's best to make sure all parties' rights are protected by attending the case with them). However, if you have kids in different states, it doesn't really matter who you go to visit as long as everyone gets together.

Q. What if my husband and I are married for 25 years and we just decided we aren't getting divorced any more?

A. It depends on how serious your situation is and what kind of separation agreement you've got. In the event you decide not to file for divorce after all those years, however, there are many steps you can take to ensure you don't lose custody of your kids forever.

First, let's talk about child support and maintenance—or, ""the right of possession."" According to California law, child support is owed automatically upon the birth of a child unless otherwise ordered by a court. However, in some cases, certain situations can lead to a reduction in the amount of child support. For example:

Child support is due when a parent is physically absent from work.

A parent moves into a new home that does not meet legal requirements for maintenance.

The mother cannot provide sufficient nutrition to the child.

A judge finds a parent has abandoned the child.

But there's no requirement that either party pay child support directly. Instead, it's up to the court to determine how much money the non-custodial parent owes for a particular period of time based on the facts of each case. The court makes its determination based on a number of factors including the length of the custodial parent's absence from work, whether he/she is physically disabled, and whether the child's health is threatened by his/her parent's inability to perform duties required by the role. (For details, see our article on Child Support.)

""In addition to using our new method of providing real-time data from every prostate biopsy, we have also been able to improve detection rates by about a third,"" says Dr Jørgen Lillestad, lead author of the study and professor at the Department of Urology, University of Copenhagen. ""This was achieved because there are no longer any false negatives or false positives among the new cohort."" The results were published today in the journal Nature Medicine.

The current method is currently only being used on one part of the body – the scrotum (a testicle), but that could be expanded to all parts of the male reproductive tract. However, the researchers stress that it will take several years before this technology can reach a wider audience in medical practice, as many hurdles remain, such as safety concerns around radiation exposure to the patient and the necessity to ensure that the patient has complete consent.

As with all existing techniques for prostate cancer screening, the new method is based on the blood sample taken during a standard biopsy procedure performed on the underside of the penis. This technique differs from other forms of early diagnosis as it allows for an accurate assessment of whether any cancer cells exist within the prostate gland. After removing tissue samples from each testicle, the researchers took DNA from each sample by sequencing it using a custom-built instrument called a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). By analysing these sequences they found the genes associated with different types of cell growth, which is why certain men have higher levels of beta-amyloid protein compared to others. In addition to this, each individual's genotype determines how much beta-amyloid is produced and which form is present in their bodies, so the analysis also reveals which type of beta-amyloid might be most likely to develop into cancer.

During testing a small number of men received hormone treatments in order to find out if those who had undergone more treatment showed greater changes in beta-amyloid levels than did those who had not undergone such treatment. A further five men underwent a combination of hormonal therapy, biopsies, and the use of a single device known as a prostate miniaturisation machine which takes blood samples from the skin in a smaller volume, allowing for faster imaging. All six men received testosterone supplements, but only four showed evidence of cancerous growths in the prostate.

For most clinical trials, at least 50% of participants achieved complete response to treatment. A higher proportion of responders showed improvement compared with nonresponders in the primary outcome measures. In the studies that examined overall outcome outcomes and in those that considered specific cardiovascular risk factors (such as triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, baseline cholesterol level, fasting insulin levels, and glucose tolerance), greater proportions of patients were significantly improved compared with placebo. No serious adverse events occurred during any of these trials. These results suggest that some patients have been treated adequately. However, not all trial subjects responded to the three drugs; in addition, the outcomes may be slightly compromised by the fact that the majority of patients in each study entered their second year after randomization, so it would be expected that about half of those receiving citalopram and 30–50% of those receiving lamotrigine would be still receiving their usual care despite achieving full recovery after 4 months or so. If we assume that only one third of the original cohort has attained full recovery, then approximately one third of the initial cohort should require additional doses of citalopram and/or lamotrigine.

The results showed a very high rate of mortality within 10 years (95% CI: 9.7–19.0; P<0.0001). There were 32 deaths occurring during follow up periods (23 per 100 person year; 95% CI: 11.3–31.9; P=0.004), whereas only one patient died from any cause following a single treatment with BCSM (Table 2). The mean time to first diagnosis varied substantially across treatment groups (from 7 days in the CTCA group to 6 months in the CCCN group), although it remained stable over time for both groups. There were five cases of myelodysplastic syndromes, three lymphomas, four melanomas and a neuroendocrine tumor. Of these, myelodysplastic syndromes were diagnosed in 14 of the 20 patients in the CTCA group and 17 of the 27 patients in the CCCN group. Three patients developed a rare form of brain tumour after a course of chemotherapy with BCSM compared to none in the control group. A total of 19 patients received more than one dose of chemotherapy, with BCSM being administered twice for those who required two. This resulted in an additional seven patients being considered ineligible for randomisation due to insufficient data on cumulative chemotherapy exposure (see Table S2) and a subsequent exclusion of one patient. In addition, six patients dropped out of the study before they could receive their allocated treatment.

It's important to remember that there are several different types of carbs, not all of which will be appropriate for everyone. A high-carb diet is typically low in fiber and protein, so don't overdo it. If you're looking to lose weight or gain muscle, aim for a ketogenic diet instead.

5. Don't Overdo Calories

If you're trying to cut down on calories, start with about 30 grams per day (around 100 calories per pound). This should be your ""calorie goal"" at the beginning of your diet, though you may want to increase this number slightly during later stages as your body adjusts. Keep in mind that when you've started cutting out some carbohydrates, you'll need to eat less food overall to avoid feeling hungry every time you go to bed. That's why you're usually encouraged to eat around 400–500 calories per day, but if you exceed that amount without losing weight, you risk eating more than you really need—and end up overeating again.

gpt2-large_53,"Psychotherapy, or psychoanalysis, is a process of therapy that can be used to help you learn to deal with your problems. It doesn't just stop at getting rid of the problem. Psychotherapists use different techniques to help you change how you think and feel about things. This type of treatment may include talking therapy (talk therapy), group therapy, individual or couples therapy, or some combination of these therapies. Many therapists are trained in both traditional and contemporary psychological approaches, but they're usually taught through traditional methods before moving on to modern ones.

How does it work? Does it require more time than therapy normally takes?

Yes. Therapy is extremely intense. That's why many people struggle to stay engaged during therapy sessions. As mentioned above, therapy can take as much as an hour a day for most people. Psychoanalysts spend years researching the root causes of anxiety and depression. They study how the brain works so they know exactly what causes them. Psychologists also work to understand the relationship between stress and mood. These theories explain why people get depressed or anxious in certain circumstances.

Psychological counseling is another form of therapy. Psychological counseling focuses on helping clients gain insight into their symptoms and thoughts. Psychologists work together with patients who suffer from mental health issues to learn more about their disorders and develop interventions that will lessen their symptoms. Some psychologists choose to specialize in one specific area of psychology while others focus on several areas of psychology. There are even psychologists who are experts in all types of psychology.

What are the main benefits of psychotherapy?

Many studies show that when individuals receive effective therapy, life gets better. For example, a study conducted by UCLA psychologist Dr. Carol Dweck found that those who received treatment were more satisfied, had fewer depressive episodes, and went home sooner. Other studies have shown similar results. People who receive good emotional support tend to live longer, make healthier choices, and enjoy happier relationships. In fact, people with higher levels of self-esteem were twice as likely to have had a happy pregnancy as those who scored lower on self-esteem measures. Even among people who do not seek treatment, there seems to be a correlation between receiving good emotional support and improving the quality of life.

The truth is I was diagnosed with my first case of diabetes at age 21 and started taking medication for it right away. At that time, doctors did not know if type 1s were actually autoimmune or something more complicated. I had no idea about this condition until after my last surgery.

What does diabetes mean in your life?

I'm a mother to two wonderful kids. My husband and I have been together since we were teenagers; we're both very successful business owners. We also enjoy traveling around and having adventures while traveling. I work full-time as a software developer, doing all sorts of creative things on the side. I love being active but don't want to lose my passion for fitness so I do yoga as often as possible. I've found the best way to maintain my health has been by making small changes and keeping an eye out for signs.

You mentioned the fact that you take medication when you start to get hungry or thirsty. What's the difference between eating and drinking water?

Well, drinking is just sitting down and letting water run over your lips. Eating is chewing food into little bits and swallowing those foods. Drinking isn't much different than eating. Food doesn't taste good when you're dehydrated because your stomach gets dry. If you drink enough water, you'll feel fuller and less tired later on.

How long have you been living with type 1 diabetes? Do you think it will go away anytime soon? How many people like you in your family can eat regular meals without getting sick?

My parents first noticed their son's behavior problems when he began showing up for school with multiple absences. They called him ""T-Rex"" because his stomach muscles looked like T-Rex (from the movie Jurassic Park). When they asked about it, I told them that what he needed to keep from feeling so bad was not dieting, exercise, or medications. He said that he would sleep better if he ate properly. But I didn't believe him. As I continued studying, my father noticed that his son's body weight had dropped dramatically. It turned out that he had taken care of himself during childhood and high school by focusing on his physical education, but then lost interest in it when he got older and became more involved in sports. After that, he focused only on his basketball career. So now he's never seen me lose my appetite again.",45,Can diabetes be cured?,-9.939878463745115,90,no_prompt,1,0.7142857142857143,430,3

Are there any special precautions I need to take when buying an all-in-one mattress?

The biggest concern about all-in-ones is weight. The heavier they are, the more likely you will experience chest discomfort if you sleep with them. While some of the more expensive units do include additional padding in order to help reduce these concerns, most of the beds available today are quite light. That said, there aren't too many things that you should avoid if you want to make sure that you'll never suffer from back pains.

Some of the most common issues that bed bugs can cause:

Painful breathing – This is actually a very common symptom among all-in-ones due to how lightweight they feel. If you find yourself experiencing chest pain while sleeping with one, try setting up your sheets to cover as much of your body as possible. If you sleep in a place where there isn't space between the walls, consider covering up even more so that you won't disturb others who may have fallen asleep beside you.

This was one of those studies that looked at whether there were differences between men and women who used hormonal contraceptives (HCP) or not, but it is important to note that while the researchers did find significant differences in these variables among all the groups, they also found a clear gender difference – which I think we can all agree on.

That's right – even though a woman may be more likely to use HCPs as compared to men, she still had a significantly higher rate of developing ovarian cancer as well as having a higher risk for other cancers in later life. The reason this study is so powerful and so controversial is because, by looking into each factor separately, the scientists discovered that there are specific factors that predispose some men to develop ovarian cancer and other men to develop ovarian cancer and those risks go up with age. It appears that when you have a younger father, then your chance of developing ovarian cancer increases – especially if he has been taking estrogen supplements for his entire lifetime. And, interestingly enough, this effect does not seem to be related to any specific kind of hormone exposure, such as from breast milk. Rather, it seems that your own testosterone levels play a key role here.

There are currently no medications available that would prevent ovarian cancer completely, and although some drugs do slow down symptoms and/or reduce the appearance of tumors, many patients will need follow-up surgeries in order to remove existing lesions. Also, some treatments for early stage disease are ineffective and in others there is an increase in side effects, including infertility, and that's something that needs to be taken very seriously in the future. One way that physicians could protect themselves against these side effects of treatments and also help out their patients is through regular blood work to check for potential ovarian cancer – so that doctors know what areas they're most likely to see and make sure that they are treating them appropriately before going under the knife.

So, how do you prevent ovarian cancer? Well, the best thing you can do is to always be aware of the signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer, whether you experience them yourself or you've seen someone else who does, so you can catch it early before it's too late! You should consider getting checked for possible ovarian cancer once every five years or sooner, preferably biopsy-free, and discuss any changes to your plan with your doctor.

""This study is significant in helping us understand how to provide a healthy diet for people with these diseases,"" said Dr. Peter Hotez of Harvard Medical School, who led the research. ""We need to better tailor nutrition programs toward those at risk.""

The researchers also found that people living on less than $2 a day were more likely to have high blood pressure compared to people living on more than $4 a day. The lower their income, the higher the odds. And this association was stronger among black women, Hispanic men, and older adults.

Dietary changes may be helpful in lowering blood pressure because they reduce cholesterol levels as well as blood sugar levels. It's unlikely that reducing blood pressure through diet alone would prevent heart disease or stroke. But it could help lower the risk of developing conditions such as diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which are associated with hypertension.

gpt2-large_83,"In many cases, there are no symptoms at all. You may have thought you were fine until you started to feel the same symptoms that have been plaguing your body for years and decades. The symptoms may be subtle or difficult to spot, but they usually take over your life – even when you're not being actively ill. Some people may experience milder episodes like a few days or weeks, while others may go on for months or longer without noticing them. If you know you had MS before you got sick, you can probably guess how debilitating it is. But if you didn't think you were immune (even though you sure did look healthy), then you aren't immune either. When this happens, your immune system has learned to use its own natural healing mechanism to fight off the inflammation that used to plague you. This is why getting MS diagnosis takes so long: Your body's natural healing ability isn't working yet. It takes time to develop the appropriate antibodies against a disease. At least two or three more years of study might help get you through this process.

What does the future hold for the people living with MS?

There's lots we still don't understand about what causes MS, or why some people don't succumb to it. We'll find out soon enough, though. For now, MS research is focused in one direction: finding ways to treat people who have the disease. Scientists studying immune cell therapies, gene-editing techniques, stem cells and other approaches are looking for new ways to slow down the course of MS. Hopefully these efforts will make it possible for people who haven't responded well to existing treatments to start treatment again, rather than waiting another decade to see if their condition improves or becomes worse. As scientists begin to tackle this challenge, I hope they also remember that the most important thing people need is love and support.

This study examined the effects of a novel oral chemotherapy regimen, which included high-dose pemetrexed and cisplatin, in combination with a standard chemotherapy regimen, on progression-free survival (PFS) to complete primary cure or partial remission for patients receiving either pemetrexed or cisplatin in phase 2a trials. The new regimen was evaluated as a single-center, randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation trial, beginning at the end of January 2014, compared to both existing therapies, which were discontinued during the same period. The efficacy of this treatment was assessed by two independent investigators blinded to group assignment. A total of 19 participants (8 pemetrexed and 5 cisplatin) were enrolled into the study; 13 were assigned to receive the new regimen compared to 13 who received pemetrexed plus cisplatin (1:5) and 6 who received pemetrexed plus cisplatin but no other drugs. At 8 months postrandomization, there was a significant reduction in mortality (p = 0.001) and a decrease from PFS with the new regimen (p < 0.0001). There was also an increase in progression-free survival (p = 0.03), with the median change from PFS to PFS at 8 months being 1 month more than with the current regimens. No significant differences in adverse events between groups were reported. These results show that this novel double-blind treatment regimen may be efficacious in combination with existing therapies in reducing the risk of severe disease in phase 2b studies, and that it represents a potential first line therapy for progressive solid tumors.

However, there was a small but statistically significant difference between the pemetrexed/cisplatin group and the cisplatin/pemetrexed group at 12 months of follow-up, with a decrease in survival rate of 9% vs 17%, respectively [24].

What are the benefits of having MS? Do they make you happier?

I have had people tell me that being able to do my job well is what makes them happy. They're proud of me for doing it well. People say this about their children; no one is better than anyone else at everything they want to accomplish. For me, being able to be productive in my current job does not mean that I am somehow superior because of my disease. There's nothing wrong with feeling good when working hard. It just means that I will need to continue to work hard and be patient with the fact that I may never be able to excel.

My question: how long after diagnosis did I start taking medications to manage my symptoms? What side effects were there for me (and how bad was it)?

When you first learn to live without your MS, you experience a range of different kinds of withdrawal symptoms, ranging from flu-like symptoms to depression. However, if you stay on medication during this time, your chances of relapsing greatly decrease. The main side effect we see with most meds to treat MS is weight gain – the longer you stay on the drugs, the greater the risk of gaining weight. These side effects are temporary but include diarrhea, cramps, headaches, nausea, anxiety and muscle aches. Withdrawal symptoms usually diminish within a few days. Most people are able to stop medication after six weeks. If you decide to go back on medication after this time period has passed, we recommend stopping it completely. You can also consider stopping for four months before starting again. This will help reduce your chance of relapse while at the same time allowing you to stay on your meds longer so you don't feel like you're ""dragging"" yourself through life.

So why is MS such an effective way to deal with chronic pain?

Pain is very common. As many as 50 percent of Americans will suffer from some form of chronic pain. Many chronic conditions can trigger these pains, including arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. When people think of MS, they often associate MS with stiffness, weakness or constant pain. While the two types of pain are indeed similar, the causes differ.

The two most important factors in MS are inflammation and oxidative stress. Both of these processes have been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) for over 40 years, but it was not until recent studies showed a clear relationship between both that we were able to make the connection. When women experience an immune response or autoimmune reaction after their menstrual periods, they will produce more cytokines which can be toxic to normal cells in our body. These cytokines may then interact with certain molecules called prostaglandins which are produced by all cells, including neurons. The higher levels of prostaglandin A found in the brain in MS patients have also been linked with reduced nerve cell survival and increased inflammation. Prostaglandins can destroy the protective coating on white blood cells that protects them against infection. This leads to infections such as pneumonia and sepsis. In addition, the high level of prostaglandins makes blood vessels leaky causing other problems. Inflammation in the muscles due to increased inflammation can lead to stiffness, pain, numbness and muscle weakness. This is known as myofascial trigger points because the site where these trigger points exist has been shown to be involved in many autoimmune diseases. Some people with MS who do not receive adequate treatment for their disease will develop symptoms at this point. It is usually too late. If you have multiple sclerosis, your doctor should work out if there are any causes of the symptoms. They may recommend treatments that help reduce the severity of the symptoms while still maintaining the benefits of immunotherapy.

Cancers of different types, the biological basis of cancer

Cancer is defined by ""a collection of abnormal cells that invade into tissues."" However, many people think it includes only non-tumor cell tumors (i.e., tumors not found in any other tissue). On the contrary, there is much overlap between cancers, especially as they affect different organs. An early example was leukemia which included various kinds of lymphomas (cellular growths), as well as some brain tumors. A recent classification system has been developed to define a broad range of cancers. It also helps us understand whether an injury, such as a fracture or burn, may be fatal, although there is still no scientific way of determining if this occurs. These two factors make understanding cancer difficult; but fortunately, our body's response is quite precise and can help greatly when interpreting results from tests performed on healthy individuals. As mentioned above, cancers vary substantially in their ability to spread, grow rapidly, and become metastatic. Also, there is very little difference in incidence among patients, except perhaps age. In fact, people younger than 40 years of age experience about half the risk of getting cancer as do those aged 50–64 years old. This indicates that each year, approximately 20% of adults who were 65 years and older got cancer during their lifetime! For persons with high blood pressure and cholesterol levels, a high BMI increases the chance of getting cancer by more than 10%. This means that for every one person who gets cancer, 3 are likely to develop diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Therefore, even though certain lifestyle habits can contribute to increasing the odds of developing certain diseases, having a good diet and exercise are important.

And, ""I'm so glad your son is here now because if you had left him at home he would've got his hand stuck in a water pail at 4:00 am every day for the last two years and then taken off with a book while everyone else was asleep. His dad must be so proud of him!""


Now, I don't blame them for thinking they're right! But it's important to remember that there are different types of autism and not all people with autism behave similarly or exactly alike. So if we are going to make judgments based on one type of autism we might as well do it the other way around.

My daughter has Asperger's syndrome, and she does need help in dealing with sensory processing challenges (like those found in social situations). She just doesn't need to be diagnosed with autism, though, but instead, needs to work hard to learn skills in order to be able to function in society without using language to describe herself. I think of it as having a cognitive-behavioral disorder called attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which requires medication and regular therapy to achieve effective results. I never heard anyone saying ""she could pass the test with flying colors""! It's simply too much for someone who hasn't been treated for ADHD; getting out of bed in the morning is a struggle, but not nearly enough to keep her from being able to participate in school. In fact, in our current culture, many of us are more concerned about whether or not a person will fail to succeed than we are about whether or not they have problems relating to others.

What advice could you offer young women in your situation?

Don't let any man tell you that you're not strong enough or capable enough. And please realize that there are plenty of us out there who are capable, strong, and confident in our own abilities. If you find yourself struggling to get the job done, remember that many women take time off from work just so they can go home with the kids every now and then. There are countless professionals around you who might help you understand your strengths and weaknesses better. Remember that you can always ask for help, even if you haven't found anyone yet to talk to.

I'm sure that you must be thinking about all the ways in which you were mischaracterized, mistreated, dismissed, and excluded from your current position. You were made fun of in front of coworkers and friends. Your boss seemed hostile towards you. She called you names like bitch and bitchface constantly throughout the interview process. Her actions toward you during a meeting suggested that she was afraid of what you might say. The amount of negative comments and questions you received was appalling! That said, the experience wasn't totally bad – just terrible. It taught me to never give up! As I look back over my career, I don't regret taking a chance; but I did learn a lot about myself. Hopefully one day, I'll be able to bring another woman into the tech industry who has experienced something similar or worse than I did.

The researchers took their data from a national survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that included about 16 million people ages 13 and older between 2006-07 and 2012-13. The participants' height was measured in centimeters from heel to toe; body mass index (BMI) was calculated using an equation developed at the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. This measure represents weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Body mass index is considered a good indicator of overweight or obesity. All participants were followed up again three years later with questionnaires and blood tests.

Compared with those who didn't do any exercise, those who did either 3 times a week or more had a 24 percent lower risk of dying during followup compared with those who exercised less than once a week. A group of 10 other studies found similar results. For example, a recent meta-analysis involving 11 previous cohort studies showed that doing at least 50 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise each day lowered mortality risks by as much as 35 percent.

And even when it came to cardiovascular disease deaths, the study authors note that ""activity levels may have been elevated"" among those who went out for a walk instead of playing sports. They note that this suggests that those who take part in frequent sports or leisure activities are likely to be healthier than the average American.

gpt2-large_131,", the benefits of a good back workout are obvious.

Backbend: The Backbend is basically a sit-up with your body perpendicular to the floor and knees bent at 90 degrees. This exercise can be done in a standing or kneeling position, depending on how you feel. If you are using a machine (like a stand up bar) it may not be possible to do this properly. Your best bet would probably be to hold something that gives you stability by the bottom and then perform a full extension. As the name suggests, the front side of your body must bend slightly toward the ground while the back side will remain straight, which allows you to move your hips more freely from the starting position. It's important to note that when doing the backbend, it should only be performed with the legs together. That way you'll have no problem getting into a proper squatting position without having to pull your feet too far apart.

Biceps Curl: A biceps curl exercise is simply an overhead dumbbell press. I recommend holding one dumbbell just above your head and squeezing as hard as you can. While performing this exercise, concentrate on keeping both elbows over the top of your shoulders and keep your shoulders as vertical as possible. Remember that these are mostly exercises for core strength and focus on making sure you're working your triceps muscles throughout all of this. If you have trouble focusing on these movements, try using a lighter weight. I personally like using 200 – 250 lbs for my biceps curls. You won't get anywhere if your biceps aren't strong enough.

Floor Press: One of my favorite ways to build muscle on your upper back is by pressing against the wall with a weighted dumbbell in each hand. Start out by pressing the dumbbells down to your chest. Once they've reached about shoulder height, gradually raise them again until you reach shoulder height. When lifting weights in this manner, don't rely solely on your glutes and hamstrings for support. Try incorporating some form of hamstring assistance and hold your hands between your legs during each rep. These workouts are great for building a thick core, but don't forget about your back. To make it easier, always remember to warm up before starting any workout!

- The same condition that causes you to have a bad day when your partner is sick and needs a lot of rest can also make it harder for you to stay focused on your work, which can affect how well you do at work. This isn't all that uncommon with people who have chronic pain, but if you experience it too often, it's worth looking into some ways to reduce the frequency of pain flare ups.

What are some treatment options?

Medications can help control pain symptoms in specific situations. Medication called opioids is used primarily to relieve moderate to severe pain. It works by increasing blood flow in certain parts of the body (such as the spinal cord). In general, the longer you use opioid medication, the more likely you will need it. However, there are some cases where other drugs may be helpful. One example is in patients whose health care provider prescribes them an anti-inflammatory drug called aspirin or ibuprofen. Other medications include:

Oral medicine - These are pills that contain medicines like acetaminophen (Tylenol), naproxen (Aleve) and others. Oral antibiotics (e.g., penicillin) and other prescription drugs used for acute infections may also be given to treat pain.

What should I expect after taking any type of medication?

After you take any type of medication, you might feel soreness or aches in one or both arms, legs or back. Sometimes this happens because you've been using the wrong medicine, or taken something else that could be causing the problem. You might notice changes in skin color, swelling or redness around the injection site.

Although psoriasis affects about 15 million people worldwide, it doesn't cause any significant health problems in most patients; it causes only moderate itching that usually subsides within months or years. It often goes away on its own as the immune system gradually eliminates the offending material. But in rare cases, psoriasis can lead to serious complications, such as lung damage and skin inflammation. For instance, a patient with psoriasis who had been treated successfully for six weeks developed severe infection, which was quickly fatal. A psoriasis specialist who reviewed the case wrote that ""the patient did not regain control and his death occurred shortly thereafter from secondary bacterial pneumonia.""

But scientists now believe psoriasis might be caused by a different type of inflammation, called granulomatous disease. Granulomatous diseases are characterized by thickening of the connective tissue layers in the body that develop over time in response to stress and environmental factors. The inflammatory process may also result in a drop in blood pressure, cholesterol levels, blood sugar levels, and other symptoms associated with high blood pressure. Research has shown that people suffering from psoriasis have more than double the risk of developing diabetes compared to the general population, despite their low exposure to stress. Researchers suspect that chronic inflammation (granuloma), which occurs naturally but increases dramatically when psoriasis develops, contributes to the higher rates of autoimmune conditions and diabetes. Granulomas aren't always visible, so physicians need to look closely to identify them, says Dr. Alan Kritonitis, director of clinical research at Case Western Reserve, who was not involved in the work.

In the current study, researchers tested two molecules—a synthetic version of cyclophosphamide and a natural compound called LKB1—in mice with psoriasis. They found that both compounds improved psoriasis by reducing the number of immune cells in the skin and preventing granulomas from forming. The cyclophosphamide and LKB1 were effective against granulomas, but neither of them significantly reduced the frequency or severity of flare-ups. In fact, the researchers found that cyclophosphamide actually increased psoriasis",132,headpats scalp psoriasis,-6.707210540771484,37,no_prompt,2,0.296,389,9

In addition, if you have pre-eclampsia, there will likely be bleeding and swelling. The condition also means that doctors may want to get you checked out by an ultrasound to see how far along your baby is.

As of last year, more than 3 million Americans have some form of MS. In addition to their physical disability and loss of mobility, people with MS also suffer emotional distress as they confront everyday challenges, including work or social difficulties and chronic illness. Because MS can interfere with normal mental functioning, many patients are forced to take medication to manage symptoms and cope with the symptoms. The problem arises when these medications cause side effects such as fatigue and headaches. For people who do not need them on a daily basis, it makes sense to use those medications only under medical supervision. However, because most people taking the prescribed drugs cannot afford the cost, this creates an uneven playing field between those who need the medicine, and the ones who don't, according to Dr. Mark Olfson, director of the Division of Multiple Sclerosis at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. There are three main reasons why certain types of medications are not appropriate for treating MS: First, people who need the drug may be able to get it without financial difficulty; however, many people with MS require substantial amounts of money each month just to make ends meet. Second, there may be other, less costly treatments available, such as immunosuppressive drugs that suppress immune functions (such as T cells). Finally, there may be other, more effective therapies that are more readily accessible to those in need.

Recently, she had been diagnosed with MS. She explained that she needed to make some extra income for her family, so she searched for alternatives to prescription medications to help her manage her condition. After reading about a company called Medtronic in Springfield, Ill., she decided to try out Medtronic's new personalized insulin pump. According to Jane, it allowed her to manage her diabetes better than she could while using standard insulin pumps because Medtronic automatically detected and adjusted her blood sugar levels. In fact, the pump was so accurate that it accurately predicted her blood sugar level within two minutes of turning it on. A week later, Jane received a letter explaining that her pump would no longer function. According to Jane, the reason given was that the manufacturer has developed an inhibitor that inhibits some of the enzymes",63,Will multiple sclerosis affect my career?,-1.4194496870040894,14,no_prompt,2,0.056,437,2

The first part of our answer to these questions is straightforward. Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects about 5 million Americans, and in 2016 alone, more than 6500 people died from MS-related causes.1 This number can be difficult to imagine because the disease is relatively mild when compared with other chronic diseases, such as heart disease or cancer.2 However, as many as 10 percent of all new cases are diagnosed every year.3 MS usually starts between ages 50 and 70 and typically involves the loss of muscle control of the legs and arms. Symptoms tend to develop gradually over time, but some people have a slow progression to full disability, often lasting years rather than weeks.4 In this article we will focus on symptoms of MS. We'll look at their clinical features and determine how they might help predict a person's risk for developing MS.

How Do I Know If My Brain Is Normal?

Most people assume that if their brain doesn't have any problems, then they're fine—that what they experience isn't real. A good test for measuring your level of neurological impairment is called an electroencephalographic (EEG) brain scan. The EEG (electroencephalogram) measures electrical activity in the brain using electrodes placed over parts of the scalp and skull. The more active the brain waves during an event, the stronger the signal.5 Although this measurement method has been around since the 1920s6, this one is now considered the best way to diagnose patients who have had major strokes.7 It was also used in the 1970s by doctors to identify Alzheimer's Disease.8

As you can see in the image below, patients with normal EEG scans show no signs of brain damage. But those with a poor EEG, such as those suffering from epilepsy, are less likely to respond to medication to alleviate seizures.9 And studies have shown that these patients have significantly worse outcomes when treated with medications.10

The next step in determining whether someone's brain looks normal is to see how much damage there really is. The typical blood sample is taken after surgery to assess cerebral edema and hemorrhage. These measurements suggest the presence of a significant amount of fluid and tissue debris.11

In most cases, imaging techniques are able to detect only minor damage. However, sometimes severe damage occurs on the whole brain, known as diffuse axonal injury.12 This type of brain damage may indicate that the brain is already undergoing irreversible changes and needs immediate treatment before further deterioration takes",54,What does multiple sclerosis diagnosis include?

It was at that point that I made my decision to leave the LDS Church. I did not want this life anymore. It's not just a matter of the physical actions I take or the words I say or even what my dress code says about me as a woman – it's also a matter of believing in something bigger than myself. What I am doing is not okay, and neither should anyone else. To make matters worse, my mother doesn't seem to understand why I'm leaving because she does not consider herself a victim either. She just wants to get through another week without losing her son. My ex-husband says the same thing. The more he talks to me about how bad things are out there, the more convinced he gets that this isn't OK – he feels so guilty that he can barely stand up in front of people. He thinks the only way to fix it is to talk to his former wife. In the end, I decided I couldn't do it any longer.

I am no longer an active member of the church but I still attend services every week, sometimes twice per month. Every time I go, I hear some version of the same story: How could you leave? You left your husband! He hates you! Why would you do such a thing? They tell me all these stories over and over again, so many times that I feel like they know I will never really change anything if I don't keep going back to them. They believe their lies and won't let me stop telling them, so when I finally decide to walk away, all I can think about is that they were right all along. If my parents believed everything they said, then the Mormon church is nothing more than a fairy tale set on a giant stage where everyone plays a part. It is an illusion created by one man who told me he loved me so much and wanted to see me happy in whatever life path I chose, then forced me into marriage against my own will. When I walked away from him, I felt like I lost something very important; like I had betrayed someone I thought I was close to.

Cramer and Dr. Peter S. Bartsch from the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.

The research team utilized a ""high-throughput"" approach to screen HIV-positive MS patients with increased levels of TNFalpha antibodies. In addition, they used an immune checkpoint inhibitor known as rituximab to treat relapses and improve clinical outcomes. Combining these treatments led to improved disease progression rates and reduced relapse rate, and also decreased adverse events associated with the therapy compared to those treated before vaccination. These data are published online in the journal Nature Communications.

In the study, which took place between September 2015 and August 2016, 15 patients with active relapsing MS were enrolled into the trial. Each patient underwent a screening examination prior to enrollment, which included testing for anti-TNFα antibodies and an electrocardiogram. All patients completed a comprehensive regimen of therapies including anti-retroviral treatment, including two cycles of interferon beta-1a (IFN-β1A) plus a cycle of rituximab and/or clopidogrel, and began the regimen within 12 weeks after their initial evaluation. Patients had to complete each step of the regimens on their own without any other supportive care to maintain remission.

At this time, one patient in each group is completing its final phase 3 clinical trial. Those who have already received either IFN-β1A or rituximab in the first four months (which were chosen because there has been no evidence suggesting that the medications could be administered concurrently with each other) will continue taking these agents indefinitely. Those who do not receive IFN-β1A or rituximab will begin receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha treatment, starting in November 2017. Although there are no indications that these drugs should be combined, patients should avoid any potentially hazardous substances during this phase 3 program.

Some people with hypothyroidism need to take thyroid medication. However, some people have no problems with taking thyroid medications.

The dose can be adjusted based on body weight and overall health. Triiodothyronine treatment is usually given by injection or through a pill. Some people also use oral thyroid hormone supplements, but these tend to cause more side effects than the oral form. This is because they're made from different ingredients that don't interact well.

Most people who have low thyroid function will eventually get better if they stop taking thyroid medication.

Furthermore, studies suggest that ADHD is associated with a higher risk of depression in patients presenting with BPD. In addition to clinical trials, there are numerous other studies aimed at identifying treatment strategies for childhood autism.

Many children with autism spectrum disorders have difficulty regulating emotions or social behaviors and their behavioral problems often manifest during early development. The symptoms can be more severe than in adults with similar conditions. Although it has been reported that some children with autism may require psychiatric services when they reach adolescence [13], these services tend not to include behavioral interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness meditation techniques which may help alleviate autistic behaviors related to emotion regulation [10]. CBT focuses on understanding emotions and recognizing negative emotions in order to develop coping skills by decreasing feelings of shame, guilt or self-blame and increasing positive feelings. However, no research has yet explored whether CBT could be useful for treating ASD in an early stage. This article aims to provide a review of current evidence concerning therapeutic modalities used to treat ASD (including CBT), including the effect of mindfulness meditation on emotional regulation.

It has been suggested that autistic children show deficits in attention and hyperactivity [18] and this may lead to difficulties in maintaining attention, processing information, or controlling impulses [19]. Hyperactivity is considered a potential cause of many social and communication difficulties observed in children with autism, which may contribute to social impairments and sensory integration difficulties [20]. Children with autism commonly report difficulty focusing on what's going on around them due to sensory impairment from sensory input, which includes hearing and visual disturbances [21]. Research suggests that autistic children present with a significant increase in perceptual distortions and eye movements compared to typically developing counterparts [22] and autistic children also have poorer auditory response times compared to typical non-autistic children [23]. These observations suggest that sensory input may disrupt cognition and lead to increased activity within cortical areas, resulting in poor working memory abilities (a key component of functioning in everyday life) [24]. In addition, autistic children may use distractibility to gain attention or avoid distraction because they perceive that",107,medication adhd anxiety,-8.438944816589355,35,no_prompt,2,0.2713178294573643,423,3

The video above gives a good impression of the camera system, and a few more details. Here's an overview from TechCrunch:

According to Vimeo: ""The first prototype was based on a Raspberry Pi 3 model B+ running Debian Linux with a custom firmware written in C++,"" which would run at around $20-30. It had a 12MP sensor and 2GB of memory (that could be expanded up to 32 GB).

""We have already been working in a hardware engineering team in Shenzhen, China since May 2016, which has been involved in design and development of this project,"" said the company in their announcement. ""Our latest prototype now includes an 8MP wide angle lens with 4K Video capture and also a 5MP main camera.""

That's great news, but what does that mean? Let's take a closer look.

1) The Camera System Is Built On A Raspberry Pi Model B+, Which Has An SD Card Slot For Up To 256GB Of Storage

This is one thing we're not sure about. So far we've seen only limited glimpses of the device, and it looks like you need a Raspberry Pi 3 model B+ with 1 TB of storage to get the full image. This isn't too surprising given that you'd expect the most powerful of these models will come with 512 GB of RAM as well.

As we mentioned previously, all the photos in the video are taken by someone wearing the device. But if you look closely you can see some other interesting bits of info in the background:

A black case covers the camera module, so it appears to be powered off when its connected to a PC or laptop. The bottom of the camera module also bears the company name.

There's a tiny red LED next to the microphone. We'll wait until a more official release to verify whether that's actually the LED or not. However, it would make sense for a camera to power itself down after recording – especially if you were using Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity.

2) There Are Three Different Models Of The Camera Module

The camera modules themselves appear to be three different types, each of them being compatible with smartphones. One of the cameras sports an 8MP fisheye lens, while another sports 16MP wide angle lens and the third is equipped with a 12MP primary unit with 2x optical zoom.

But he will continue to monitor his own blood sugar as closely as possible, just like anyone else. ""I don't think there are too many people who would tell you something like this is a miracle drug,"" he said.

Dietitians have long warned people about the dangers of being sedentary, which keeps their blood sugar levels low, but many physicians say it is important to be active when blood sugar is low -- particularly during times when they need insulin shots or other treatment.",22,my risk for developing type 2 diabetes,-13.164403915405272,243,no_prompt,2,0.972,174,0

As a result of these new findings, scientists are now planning to develop a drug that would target specific genes involved in different aspects of MS development. In addition to targeting specific proteins, they are also exploring how an anti-MS treatment could be administered via injection into patients with less severe forms of the disease. They have already begun evaluating this idea in monkeys and mice at both NIH's National Institute on Aging (NIA) and Children's Hospital Boston.

""The goal is to eventually produce drugs to specifically block or degrade some of the active pathways of the disease,"" said coauthor Dr. Tarek El Aissami, M.D., director of NIA's Division of Regenerative Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. ""We're taking our time because we want to study all possible ways to prevent or slow progression.""

In addition to improving the efficacy of current treatments for MS, the researchers believe the discovery may lead to novel therapies for other conditions involving a similar pathway to MS. For example, the team found that cells from individuals who had experienced brain damage from stroke or traumatic brain injury were resistant to inhibition by the drug known as BPS1002A—a compound previously developed by scientists at the University of California, San Francisco. But when injected directly into the brains of young adults, the drug did not affect their ability to learn to read and write in response to visual stimuli. This suggests that the neurons in those people were able to recover to normal functioning after having been damaged during childhood.

Researchers will continue to examine the role of the genes involved in MS in more detail and try to identify potential targets to improve the effectiveness of existing drugs. The ultimate goal, experts say, is to make better treatments available to patients through improved access to them. And it may require finding ways to speed up the process of cell division, a key step toward developing medicines that target gene expression. As early as next year, doctors expect to begin testing new strategies to activate pluripotent stem cells—cells capable of forming any type of tissue in the body—to create therapeutic compounds.",57,multiple sclerosis stages phases,-10.67848014831543,58,no_prompt,2,0.28019323671497587,360,0

Methods A single-blinded, randomized, crossover study was conducted at a university hospital between June 1995 and May 1997. Each subject completed an initial 10-day ketogenic diet trial on the same day as baseline evaluation. On week 12 of the first phase of the study, the participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments: a low fat ketogenic diet (LFKD), a normal protein ketogenic diet (NPKD), or a high protein ketogenic diet (HPKD). In addition, 6 weeks after the end of the LFKD, the subjects received a course of intravenous vitamin K1 for osteoarthritis and calcification and weekly bone scans to assess their bone mineral density. Subjects entered the second phase of the study 24 hours following completion of the 2nd phase of the diet. This time period included 3 days of the LFKD, 2 days of the HPKD, and 3 days of NPKD. All subjects remained in this period. During the last 5 days of this 8-week interval, all subjects underwent a 3-hour visit by orthopedic surgeons who performed hip radiographs, CT scans, chest X-rays, and ultrasound examinations. Followup was obtained annually until April 1999. Of the 18 subjects whose followup was not required for 2 consecutive years, 15 had either a loss of ability to maintain self-care, or had been lost to follow up within the first year of the study. After completing the 16-year follow-up, 8 of 9 subjects had no progression of disease. Because of the high frequency of adverse events, we restricted our analysis to those who developed POTS or PFS and were evaluated by a neurologist. To reduce possible confounding effects related to other potential causes of illness, we excluded persons with diabetes mellitus (DM), pregnancy, alcohol abuse, hypertension, chronic renal failure, or thyroid disease during the entire study. Only individuals who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and gave informed consent were eligible for enrollment in the study. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant before beginning the diet. Clinical evaluations and laboratory tests were performed according to standard principles.

gpt2-large_93,"Sleeping problems, particularly if they're associated with sleep apnea or obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), are common among older adults. SLE causes a decrease in the amount of oxygen that reaches the brain over time and can lead to memory loss and cognitive impairment. OSA is caused by breathing difficulty that occurs when you're sleeping too deeply or moving too much during REM sleep — when your body's clock keeps track of how long you've been awake. Sleep studies have shown that older adults who had SLE were more likely to report insomnia. A recent study also found a link between MS and chronic daytime sleepiness (CDS). CDS is an anxiety disorder characterized by disturbances in the level and timing of waking up, including nightmares and excessive daytime sleepiness. It tends to be more prevalent in women than men, and is usually milder than MS. Some experts believe that CDS may worsen as people age; however, it doesn't appear to be related to SLE. One way to help prevent CDS might be to get rid of unnecessary clutter in one's home. A new app called Simplenote has the ability to do just that. The idea behind Simplenote is simple: You share your daily routine with a group of friends or loved ones via text message. Then, the app asks them to add pictures from their days so that you can see what you're doing and who you're with. If you decide you don't want any images added, then simply ignore it until you leave for work at midnight or you reach your bedtime. Simplenote will automatically delete images that were not relevant to your day.

The CDC is currently reviewing the safety of the Covid-19 vaccine, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2008 as an adjuvant to interferon beta-1b (IFN-alpha) therapy for MS patients who were already receiving multiple sclerosis treatment with interferons such as IFN-beta-1a or IFN-beta-2a.

A study published earlier this year found that the vaccine may raise the risk of adverse events in people taking two-drug therapies, such as interferon beta 1-beta (interferon beta), and it has been shown to have no effect on those who are taking one drug. However, even if the results of these studies hold true, there's still a concern about the long-term effects of the immune system boosting medication.

""When you're given a new treatment you should be monitoring your condition closely,"" says Dr. Thomas J. O'Keefe, medical director at the University of California San Diego Medical Center. ""But this vaccine seems like it might put someone over the edge.""

The vaccine contains small amounts of what experts call adjuvants, chemicals that help boost the effectiveness of another antiviral medication—interleukin 6 (IL-6)—which is used when interferon beta isn't working as well. Interferon beta can also sometimes cause serious side effects such as diarrhea and rash, so any increase in IL-6 could theoretically lead to more severe conditions.

However, according to the FDA, there is limited evidence linking the use of IL-6 adjuvants to serious side effects, including arthritis, depression and chronic fatigue syndrome. Moreover, there's only anecdotal evidence indicating that the vaccine can increase the risk of autoimmune disease among individuals who take interferon beta.",72,Is the Covid-19 vaccine safe for people taking multiple sclerosis drugs?,-0.0029605866875499,0,no_prompt,2,0.0,264,31

The most common type of MS is relapsing-remitting disease, which affects about 10 million people worldwide. But it can also affect other types and the condition can be caused by an infection or a brain tumor. Some patients have a relapse after treatment for their MS; others remain symptom free.

Patients with MS who do not respond well to drugs may eventually develop several different types of MS:

Type 1 — an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks healthy cells

— an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks healthy cells Type 2 — a more progressive form involving inflammation and scarring

— a more progressive form involving inflammation and scarring Type 3 — where the immune system starts attacking the central nervous system, often causing memory problems and paralysis

""We see a lot of people who are in their 50s or 60s with diabetes,"" said Dr. Andrew J. D'Adamo, the chief medical officer for the American Diabetes Association (ADA). ""They're having to go on insulin shots every day because they just don't have enough blood sugar.""

With so many more Americans getting older with type 2 diabetes, health care providers are also seeing an increasing number of patients with neuropathy, a condition that causes numbness of fingers, toes, feet or other extremities after intense activities like lifting heavy objects or running. Doctors are often concerned about these patients, since it's difficult to treat if the nerves aren't properly functioning. But they may not know if they need surgery before too long, making them vulnerable.

Some patients with chronic pain from fibromyalgia do have nerve damage, but those who have had surgery probably already knew about it, said Dr. Thomas Sperandio, a professor at the University of California-Los Angeles School of Medicine.

The ADA is helping educate doctors and nurses about this issue through its website called AskDrAmeriMed.org, which offers answers to common questions about types of nerve damage and treatment options.

But even when some nerve damage does occur, it usually isn't as severe as people think, according to D'Adamo. In fact, most nerve damage doesn't cause any symptoms or serious complications, he said.

""What we've learned from these cases is that we shouldn't overreact,"" said Dr. Steven Zaloga, director of neurosurgery at New York Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. He treats patients with severe nerve damage in his clinic and describes such cases frequently with patients. Sometimes, he says, the patient has been afraid to seek help.

For example, in one recent case, a man had two operations for nerve damage, but when he finally saw a doctor, doctors told him he might never walk again. Instead, they placed electrodes on his arm to monitor his nerve signals while they fixed the broken bones around his ankle, said Zaloga, adding that some patients have suffered permanent paralysis without any complications.

Our primary analyses used a population-based cohort study design in which we prospectively followed all patients with metastatic lung cancer from September 2008 to December 2010 at the Cancer Centre of North South University Hospital in Port Elizabeth, New Zealand. The main analysis was performed by using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute). We assessed the potential biases of our approach, including data bias from missing diagnoses. A sensitivity analysis of all cases identified through the electronic surveillance system also included deaths that were not reported or that could have been missed by use of the computerized mortality register [ 18 ]. In addition, a third analysis of all patients undergoing conventional surgery or radiotherapy were excluded because they had no information on tumour location, type, and volume. Data on quality of life and progression-free survival are presented in figure 2. Of 3 658 794 person years of follow-up during the trial period, 20 092 (95% CI 19 849–20 543) people died. The overall cumulative incidence rate was 0·5 per 100 000 patient years compared to a global mortality rate of 4·4 per 100 000 person years among patients who received conventional treatment, which was similar to those seen in other studies using different methods [ 12, 14, 15 ], except for one trial that showed higher rates of death in patients with lung cancer treated with conventional radiation therapy versus conventional chemotherapy [ 17 ].

The main findings from this review of RCTs involving chemotherapy for recurrent lung cancer were that there is little evidence for efficacy in terms of improved survival when compared to conventional therapy, although some benefit has been observed against both conventional and non-conventional therapies [ 10 – 13 ]. There is convincing evidence of significant harm associated with conventional therapy, including increased risks of malignancy and prolonged hospital stay [ 12 – 16 ]; however, no conclusive conclusion can be drawn about whether further research should be undertaken regarding alternative approaches to improving outcomes of clinical trials involving these treatments. This is particularly important given that many cancers remain resistant to current therapies [ 17 ] and most likely require further investigation, especially in light of increasing evidence suggesting that lifestyle factors may play a role in determining whether and when chemotherapy becomes necessary for future disease management [ 18, 19 ].

gpt2-large_53,"A: Psychotherapy, in its most basic sense, is the process of helping people to overcome their fears and anxieties by learning ways to manage those issues. The therapy has many different forms including group therapy and individual therapy. While groups are often described as a form of ""talk therapy"", they can also be used to deal with psychological problems such as anxiety disorders and addictions. Individual therapy involves the use of techniques designed specifically for individuals who have specific challenges or problems. In some cases these may involve more than one session and should therefore be considered part of a larger treatment plan.

Q: How is psychotherapy different from psychotherapies?

A: Cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) are a type of therapy that focuses on changing thoughts and behaviors so that the person feels better about himself and his life. This type of therapy typically uses cognitive theories such as cognitive restructuring and exposure therapy, which help clients learn to identify and change problematic thinking patterns. However, CBT is not intended to treat all symptoms associated with mental health conditions; rather it is meant to reduce symptoms associated with certain types of mental illness. Many of the cognitive distortions found in CBT are known to contribute to the development of depression and other psychiatric illnesses. Some studies suggest that certain aspects of CBT, such as the use of talk therapy, may actually increase the risk of developing psychiatric diseases later in life, but this research does not yet provide evidence for this possibility.",53,what is psychotherapy?,-0.1237228587269783,4,no_prompt,2,0.022222222222222223,251,4

– Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is an important marker of atherosclerosis in older people and has a direct relationship to both coronary artery disease and all-cause mortality in middle-aged men. It has also been linked to several other disorders including diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, gallstones, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus.

– Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreases as weight increases and is related to type 2 diabetes mellitus; it has also been tied to poor cardiovascular health and to increased all-cause mortality in women. High cholesterol has been associated with inflammation, vascular calcification, osteoarthritis and breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Low concentrations of total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are associated with a greater likelihood of developing cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, end stage renal disease, diabetes and heart attack. The incidence of heart attacks has doubled over the past 50 years in North America due to obesity and related metabolic abnormalities.

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration has decreased from its peak during childhood and adolescence to between 70% and 80% in adults and 30% and 40% among young children aged 0 - 4 years.

gpt2-large_45,"The answer is yes, but it has to do with your diet. It's the type of diet you eat that affects how badly your body gets sick. Here are a few important tips:

The type and amount of food you eat will determine whether or not your blood sugar rises and whether or not you develop type 2 diabetes. For example, if you're eating plenty of fruit, vegetables and whole grains, you don't need to worry about diabetes because you have enough insulin in your bloodstream to keep your blood sugar low. However, if you're going on an extremely high carbohydrate diet (like those who follow Atkins or other ""ketogenic"" diets), this means your body may run out of insulin and start producing glucose instead. If this happens, your pancreas doesn't know what to do and will try to make more glucose by releasing hormones called glucagon-like peptide-1, which can lead to kidney damage and even death. This is why some people get really upset when they hear about their doctor recommending the Ketogenic Diet for diabetics, because that's exactly what it does – it causes the pancreas to go into overdrive and create extra glucose. So the best thing you can do at that point is not to become diabetic! By following a healthy, balanced, non-carbohydrate diet as prescribed by your physician, you'll find that you get sick less often and suffer fewer side effects than your typical person would from being hooked up to pumpkins, cakes and pancakes!

What kind of foods should I eat to avoid getting type 2 diabetes? You've probably heard all kinds of conflicting advice about what types of foods are safe to eat before starting a ketogenic diet. There is very little science behind these recommendations. That said, there is one rule of thumb that you should be able to stick to: no sugary soft drinks or any other processed junk food!

Are there foods that aren't good choices for people with diabetes? Yes, but only after carefully weighing the benefits against the risks. Most foods contain carbohydrates, fats, proteins and micronutrients, and so while certain foods may be appropriate for someone with diabetes, others won't work at all. In fact, most of the time, it pays not to choose foods unless you truly understand them and can safely handle them. We have already discussed the importance of maintaining your own healthy weight as well as keeping your blood sugar levels within reason. In addition, we also recommend avoiding excess fat intake, including saturated fat and trans fat.",45,Can diabetes be cured?,-7.329573631286621,64,no_prompt,2,0.5079365079365079,425,6

3. Painful Sex (Especially In The Lube)

If you've ever been caught masturbating while using a vibrator or dildo without lubricant, then you know what I'm talking about here. This hurts so bad for your genitals because the muscles in your penis get stiff from rubbing all that lube against them every time you're having sex.

4. Hairy Vagina (And Bad Hair Loss!)

This one might surprise some people, but many women find themselves suffering from an annoying condition called hair loss after their periods stop. If you have hair loss, there are several things you can do: use facial hair removal cream (like these), try a topical form of Botox such as this one, or go under-the-surface laser treatments like this one. If none of those work, then just shave off half of your head. Seriously, don't take any chances and don't let anyone see you doing anything unusual!

5. A Little Bit Of Urine Or Blood In Your Ears After Getting An STD

Like we said before, if you happen to catch a sexually transmitted infection when you're not supposed to, you need to take care of yourself first. Some STIs (or infections) can cause serious problems if left untreated. You may be able to prevent getting one by taking care of your hygiene and keeping safe at home.

6. Constipation Problems

Constipation is when bacteria in your colon make too much acid. If you experience constipation, you should avoid eating anything acidic that isn't made from fruits or vegetables and don't drink milk or water.

7. Acne

As I mentioned above, acne is when skin grows on your face or around your eyes (especially the area behind the ears). It usually happens during puberty. So if you haven't yet started menstruating, stop looking into shaving and/or cutting off part of your body. Don't worry—you will feel better anyway.

The most common symptom of IBS is diarrhea, usually followed by abdominal cramping and abdominal distention. Other symptoms include constipation, bloating, bloating, flatulence, gas or gas-producing flatus in the colon, and excessive gas when taking laxatives or during vomiting. These symptoms are not always present together with IBS, but may occur separately or together with other gastrointestinal complaints. The cause for these various symptoms can be different, but they may all result from the same underlying condition. Many IBS patients experience some degree of relief from their symptoms. Some people have no significant improvement at all and often find that they actually feel worse after experiencing their symptoms.

IBS may also cause chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). CFS affects both adults and children and occurs due to a combination of genetic factors as well as environmental causes.

It is not known whether there are some specific factors that may cause MS patients who have experienced several months or years of disease to display signs and symptoms of MS that appear similar to those of women with MS. But if such factors exist, it would suggest that in people who experience these symptoms, many of their MS-related health problems could be due to a combination of biological and environmental factors related to estrogen exposure during early life and/or as an adult. In addition to differences between MS and other MS disorders, there is also a growing body of evidence showing how estrogen exposure leads to various forms of cancer, including breast, ovarian, prostate, and leukemia. For more information about this issue, see my essay ""Does estrogen make you sick?""

MS can affect the heart: Why does MS affect the heart?

The relationship between heart health and MS has been studied extensively. Several studies have shown that, although most people with MS will eventually get well (if they ever do), many people continue to experience exacerbations of their condition even after having recovered from an acute episode. Some people become so disabled by MS that they lose function in one arm or the right side of their body; others remain profoundly disabled with little physical sensation in any limb. The reasons for this variability in response to stress, illness, injury, and other causes remains unclear. There are indications that the immune system becomes impaired in people with MS at least in part because of a genetic predisposition toward atherosclerosis—a weakening of blood vessels leading to narrowing of arteries. However, this finding must await further research into possible factors involved in the development of MS.


There are no good treatments for MS. Yet despite all the advances made over the past few decades, MS continues to strike millions of people every year.

What are the signs and symptoms of MS?

Several of the common symptoms associated with MS include fatigue, joint pain, muscle weakness, dizziness, headaches, memory loss, blurred vision, and problems with balance and coordination. Because of these symptoms, many people describe them as chronic. Others say they feel unwell only occasionally.

People often report worsening of MS symptoms after starting treatment with drugs called anti-inflammatory drugs. These medications interfere with the production of certain cytokines, which are important components of the immune system. Anti-inflammatory drugs may increase the risk of developing infections in the brain, including ones linked to MS.",77,How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?,-0.418798953294754,3,no_prompt,3,0.012396694214876033,430,17
gpt2-large_1,"The disease of obesity is the worst. It affects not only our health but also that of our children, who end up being overweight or obese as adolescents in their teens and become morbidly obese adults at a young age. This means they get more diseases than people with normal weight, including cancer, heart attacks, stroke, Alzheimer's, and diabetes. The number one cause of death among all Americans aged 20 years or older was cardiovascular disease (heart attack and stroke). Obesity causes about 4 million new cases of diabetes each year, which leads to almost 10 million deaths annually.

What can we learn from the data on chronic illnesses?

First, it helps us understand why these diseases occur. They arise when the body makes too many hormones. These include insulin, leptin, growth hormone, cortisol, thyroid hormone, sex steroid hormones such as testosterone, and corticosteroid hormones like prednisone. Many chronic conditions result from malfunctioning of these hormones, causing overproduction of inflammatory agents, especially free fatty acids. In addition to inflammation, hormonal imbalances cause damage to cells and organs.

Second, understanding the mechanisms involved allows us to make better medical decisions and develop healthier lifestyles. For example, doctors may be able to prescribe drugs to help people with low blood sugar control their level. Also, understanding the mechanism of chronic illness allows us to predict the best treatments, so patients can choose treatments based upon the right ones. This could save lives!

Third, studying chronic illnesses gives us an insight into how our environment influences them. We learn what chemicals contribute to changes in the immune system and what are the factors that influence development of certain chronic diseases. Understanding the impact of stress on the immune system enables scientists to test different strategies for treating people with chronic diseases and find the most effective way to prevent or delay some of their problems.",1,What are the most common chronic diseases?

""It's possible that it might make people feel less productive.""

In addition to its side effects, chronic pain is one area where current treatments are still largely ineffective, the researchers say. That's because most drugs target the pain receptors located in the brain and spinal cord rather than the nerve cells themselves. In general, opioids like morphine and oxycodone act by blocking those nerves, making them numb but leaving muscle tissue unharmed. However, many different types of painkillers also block pain-activated pathways in the nervous system; for instance, acetaminophen or Tylenol works primarily through a class of receptors called NMDA receptors, which bind to glutamate receptors. These drugs, which include Advil and Motrin (both made by GlaxoSmithKline), are effective in treating mild to moderate levels of pain, although they aren't as helpful in more severe cases.

The new drug targets another receptor group, the KORs, which are found mainly in neurons throughout the body. It does so by modulating their ability to transmit signals, such as calcium signals from neurons that control movement. The authors say the results indicate that blocking these channels could improve the effectiveness of opioid medications — perhaps even reversing some of the negative impacts of opioid addiction.

PINCUS noted that his team had already shown that blocking these pathways could help relieve symptoms of acute nerve injury. He pointed out that other studies have also demonstrated that KORs also play a role in preventing inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. And, he added: ""If we're going to do anything about pain, then it makes sense to target these channels before they get damaged.""",62,"disclosing multiple sclerosis at work, how will colleagues react?",-10.19078254699707,99,no_prompt,3,0.45,310,1

But I would argue that there are many other conditions that can cause symptoms similar to mine.

I started experiencing these symptoms after having an episode of diarrhea about four months ago. This was unusual for me: Usually when I go through a period of intense diarrhea, it usually comes down within 24 hours. But on one particular day, I didn't recover from it at all! Instead of feeling sick afterward, I felt like crap for days. So I decided to check myself into the ER right away. They took blood and urine samples, asked me some questions, gave me some antibiotics (which worked), but nothing worked. It seemed like everything was working perfectly fine, which made sense because I hadn't experienced any sort of illness since I'd been sick two years earlier.

The next morning, I went back home, got dressed, and ate breakfast. At work, I read a book, talked to coworkers, and generally did whatever I could to keep my mind off of things. After I left the office, I checked myself in again at the ER, where they continued their exam and did another blood test. Again, nothing changed. I kept looking around for clues to what might be wrong—there were none—and concluded that maybe I should try to eat less sugar-sweetened foods and drink lots of water.

So, I cut back on my processed food consumption and increased my daily intake by 10 percent over the course of five weeks. That ended up reducing my overall calorie intake by nearly 400 calories per day, which seemed like a lot. In addition, I quit drinking soda.

gpt2-large_63,"MS is a chronic inflammatory disease. It affects the central nervous system and the immune system, causing pain, fatigue, difficulty thinking or speaking, changes in mood, loss of muscle tone, stiffness, numbness, weakness, and memory problems. It can also lead to blindness, paralysis or deafness in one eye, severe joint damage such as osteoarthritis, or problems with breathing. A person with MS has often found that her or his disability limits their activities. This means that they may be unable to work full time or for a long period of time. Even if someone does have full-time jobs, it could still be difficult for them due to the high medical costs of treating MS. For some people, however, there are options for managing their MS conditions and working or doing other things while they manage their condition. In addition, those who choose to remain active may find that their quality of life improves because they can continue to participate in activities that do not involve daily physical activity.

My doctor says I should not try to exercise, because exercise will only make me stronger. What's wrong with that?

Exercising is important for your health and well being; however, too much exercise at once can cause more harm than good. There are several ways to reduce the risk of injury associated with excessive exercise. The best way to limit the risks of exercising excessively would be to take steps to maintain optimal body weight. If you don't want to lose weight, you need to eat a healthy diet. Eating a balanced diet makes sure that you get all the nutrients needed to survive. Also, keep in mind that if you exercise frequently, you may burn up more calories during an exercise session compared to when you were inactive.

Are there any supplements that might help with my symptoms?

The biggest advantage over medications is that these products are generally safe and effective. Many patients report feeling better after taking these types of supplements.

These types of supplements include: fish oil

A review of all studies published in English, French, and German between 1980 and 2009 found that patients with MS or another neurological disease had a lower risk of developing the other diseases than non-MS patients. In contrast to other diseases, many of these associations were not significant when controlling for potential confounders (i.e., age). However, most studies did not control for possible confounding by sex (not shown), which could account for some findings that are inconsistent among studies. Of the 32 prospective studies included in the meta-analysis, 22 reported a positive association between MS and neurologic outcomes; 10 reported no significant effect and eight showed an association. The only study in our analysis that suggested a negative impact on neurological outcomes was one from Italy where people with Alzheimer's disease who smoked were at increased risk for brain atrophy compared to nonsmokers (13). This is consistent with previous research indicating that smoking increases the incidence of dementia (14–16 ).

Among studies reporting an association, we also identified studies that met the inclusion criteria ( ). One cohort study (N = 624) examined patients with acute myeloid leukemia as a stratification variable between those diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia and normal controls (17 ), but a second (N = 703) assessed MS cases as a dichotomous covariate and none used the ADOS method. We excluded studies in which the primary outcome measure was disease duration (n = 12), because such data cannot be combined into a single score. Studies comparing MS patients to non-MS patients without a history of MS (n = 17) or patients with active disease versus no clinical symptoms (n = 2) could have been missed if they had lacked information about time since diagnosis. A further exclusion criterion was studies that reported the number of months since diagnosis (n = 15), as this may change over time from a continuous variable to a categorical one (18 ).

All studies reviewed here were conducted in Europe and North America. An additional two studies (both US) were conducted in South Africa (19) and four in the United States (20–22).

gpt2-large_54,"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic disease of the central nervous system. It affects up to 5 percent of people in developed countries and may affect 10 percent or more in other areas, such as developing countries and those with poorer health care systems. The condition can have long-term physical and psychological effects that persist for years or even decades after treatment ends.

What's causing my symptoms?

Several factors play roles in MS, including:

Age. Some people age at different rates compared to others. In some cases, individuals develop MS before they are 25 years old. MS can also occur later than normal in young adults.

Although there is no cure or vaccine, many treatments exist to help control MS symptoms and improve quality of life. Race. MS affects some ethnic groups at higher rates than other races. Because there is no one way to diagnose MS, several diagnostic tests are used to determine if someone has MS. These include:

Vascular imaging (CT) scans of the brain and spinal cord are often useful indicators of MS risk.

MRI scans are often helpful in identifying specific cells within the damaged brain stem (encephalon). But these images do not reveal what is happening outside the brain stem and spine. They only show where lesions, which indicate damage to the central nervous system, are located. This information is essential in determining whether there is active disease activity in any part of the body.

The researchers, led by Professor Christopher Mascarenhas of the University of Sydney in Australia, used a new type of immunotherapy called 'T-cell mediated immunity' that is designed specifically for MS patients to deliver targeted anti-inflammatory drugs directly into the immune system, with no need for a transplantation. This approach was effective at treating people with relapsed disease after they had been on standard therapy for several years. The treatment has now been shown to be safe and well tolerated in clinical trials conducted in Europe.

""We were able to show that T-cells can actually stop an autoimmune reaction in this way,"" said Dr. Mascarenhas. ""By targeting these cells we could potentially halt or reverse some of the inflammatory responses that occur in people who have relapsing MS.""

The findings are published today in Nature Immunology.

In addition to being tested as an adjunct to existing therapies, the method could also provide hope for those patients whose disease does not respond to other treatments.

""A key challenge for our research is finding out exactly how specific these T-cell driven immunity injections are – we don't yet know if it's the T-cells themselves or any particular proteins they're making,"" explained Dr. Mascarenhas. ""And this is where the development of novel T cell induced immunity therapeutics will help us answer those questions.""

Previous studies have shown that T-cells can produce antibodies against all three types of human autoimmunity: multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. In MS, the body develops antibodies directed against various parts of the nerve tissue that causes inflammation.

The team worked closely with researchers from Germany and Switzerland to understand how immunotherapy works to target autoreactive T cells. These T cells act like a natural defence against invading bacteria and viruses, but when infected, they trigger an immune response that destroys the antigen that triggered the infection. But they are also capable of producing their own antibody against the foreign substance. This means that when they're activated with a protein called interleukin 6 (IL6), the T-cells generate antibodies that bind to IL6 receptors and inhibit production of IL6 in the blood vessels. That prevents the immune system from attacking its own tissues, allowing normal tissue to heal over time.

The study, which was published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, showed that low vitamin D levels were associated with more severe and increased risk for coronary heart disease. The researchers also found lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations to be associated with an increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. These findings suggest that high vitamin D levels may have a role to play in preventing these conditions.

""Our results provide new evidence suggesting that low vitamin D is a significant contributor to chronic kidney disease in men,"" said Dr. Mark J. Smith from Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. ""This could explain why patients who are overweight or obese have higher rates of poor renal function than their normal weight counterparts.""

As many as one third of all U.S. adults are considered at high risk for developing cardiovascular diseases like stroke and coronary artery disease (CAD). In addition, 30 percent of people with metabolic syndrome are at risk for developing CVD, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). This condition refers to a cluster of conditions including obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, elevated glucose levels and abnormal cholesterol levels.

A variety of studies have linked low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D with various adverse health outcomes. One study published in 2011 by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute suggested that low vitamin D levels had been linked to type 2 diabetes and other cardiovascular problems. Other research has shown that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of certain cancers, heart attack and premature death among women.

Low vitamin D levels have also been linked to an increased risk of pancreatic cancer and bladder cancer. However, there is little conclusive data about whether this association holds true when it comes to women. While most epidemiological research indicates that females appear to have slightly greater risks of developing a number of serious illnesses, such as depression, lung cancer and breast cancer, they do not appear to get cancer more frequently than men.

So how much vitamin D does your body need? To answer this question, researchers collected blood samples from more than 20,000 American women between the ages of 18 and 64 during pregnancy and lactation. During the period from 1998 to 2007, they administered 1,600 IU/day of vitamin D3 to each woman's urine. Then they looked at the differences in the vitamin D metabolites called calcidiol, cholecalciferol and 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3, measured",123,hypothyroidism symptoms,-13.758965492248535,161,no_prompt,3,0.9938271604938271,409,0

If the display is off, then they will probably be able to get a clear picture. But if you're just watching TV or watching movies in your room, I think it's best to have an external display on there so you can see what you're doing and not distract yourself from what you are supposed to be doing. In my case, I don't watch any sports because I hate watching them on a television. It makes me feel like I'm cheating the game. If you do want to play some sport while you watch TV, the problem with using your laptop as a desktop monitor is that sometimes the screen will go black, which means you won't be able to read the text on the screen until the power goes out. And when this happens, it takes about two hours to restore your system back to normal, but even after that, you may need to wait another hour before you can view anything again. So I would say leave the LCD on the laptop at all times (unless your viewing is in-home). That way you can check your email or a web page without turning the screen on. If you don't mind reading something on the screen, then go ahead and turn it on and off.


Do not sit near the speakers of your laptop. While a lot of laptops come preinstalled with speakers, these speakers are usually hidden by software that sits on top of your system. The problem with this is that these speakers tend to create a horrible sound. There are other options available for playing music. For example, your laptop has a built-in stereo headphone jack. This jack plugs into either the left or right speaker output of your laptop. As long as both lines are connected, you should be fine.


A good alternative is to plug a pair of headphones directly into the laptop's 3.5mm audio jack. There are several different models of headphones, many of them with dedicated ports for each earbud. They also come in different sizes and styles, so check their website to find one that fits your particular needs.

METHODS:

Twenty healthy subjects participated in this crossover intervention involving 8 weeks of CDP supplementation at different doses for 10 days. Mice were randomly assigned to receive either CDP or vehicle (control) before a training session with a 3 min warm up followed by a 30 s high intensity interval between sets performed 2 times per day. Muscle biopsies, blood samples and serum were obtained after each training session for biochemical analyses including serum CKs (creatine kinase), myoglobin (creatinine kinase), as well as plasma total homocysteine (T Hcy). In addition, plasma levels of glucose, insulin and glucagon and phosphorylated creatine kinase activity were measured in vitro with Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining methods using antibodies against CDK4 and CDK5.

RESULTS:

The mean difference in muscle hypertrophy between groups was significant between all time points (P < 0.001; ). There was no significant difference in the changes in muscle mass and strength between groups (P > 0.05). After treatment, there was a decrease in both muscle mass and strength (P < 0.005). No differences were observed in the change in phospho-CD36 expression between groups at any time point. During the first 4 weeks of treatment, there was an increase in plasma THcy but there was no change in serum CK levels, as assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. However, after 12 weeks, there was a significant improvement in muscle mass and strength in the CDP-treated group. Furthermore, there was also a positive correlation between plasma CK level and the decrease in muscle mass (r = 0.54; P < 0.0001).

The Different Kinds of Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)


If you have been prescribed an effective drug to treat your MS symptoms, then there are a few different types of symptoms which may be causing them. These include:

Generalized and Specific

These two different categories of symptoms are what make up most of the cases of MS. Each type of symptoms has its own name and description, which means it's impossible to tell if it's caused by the same condition as another type of problem. The first type of disease usually causes more common symptoms like joint pain and stiffness, but when a patient has both MS-specific and generalized signs and symptoms, we refer to this syndrome as ""multiple sclerosis."" There are many other conditions associated with these two types of MS symptoms, so the list is long.

Different Types of Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (Multiple Sclerosis)

Affected Individuals - Affected individuals often have some form of pain, swelling, and weakness in one or all limbs. Some of them also report muscle weakness, stiffness, and fatigue. Sometimes, these people experience loss of vision, hearing, or balance. However, this type of disability is more commonly seen in women than men. As with any medical disorder, many factors contribute to an individual's response to medications. Unfortunately, women who take certain drugs to treat their MS, such as carbamazepine or topiramate, often experience more severe symptoms than those who do not take these drugs. Men often suffer from more debilitating symptoms because of more subtle differences between their bodies, including decreased immune function and increased sensitivity to infection. While a particular medication may offer relief to some affected individuals, others still must meet strict requirements before getting treatment.

The study showed that the drug, which is already approved in Europe for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, has the potential to help hundreds of thousands of people suffering from MS. It also shows how effective the new drug could be in treating other diseases including hypertension, diabetes and obesity.

In a report by Healthline, Dr. Thomas Deutsch, MD, director of the MS Center at the University of California San Francisco, said the findings are ""a major milestone"" that should encourage more research into this promising drug in other autoimmune disorders.

One of the key factors limiting success with MS drugs is their lack of ability to boost brain cells' production of a protein called TGF-beta1 (TGF-Beta 1), or its main component, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF). This molecule plays an important role in keeping immune cells alive and healthy.

""If we can get rid of TGF-beta1 somehow, then those cells will not die, they'll just stop making it,"" said coauthor Dr. Robert Kandel, PhD, professor emeritus of neurology and neurological sciences at Harvard Medical School. ""They might even live longer.""

Researchers found that when researchers injected the drug directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of rats before injecting them with a placebo control (the standard therapy), the animals had greater numbers of TGF-beta1 compared to mice given either no injection or a saline solution that was similar in appearance but lacked the drug.

The results were published online on May 8 in JAMA Neurology. The study included two other groups: one made up of patients who received the drug and another group treated with a sham injection that did not produce any effect.

But most surprising, the study also revealed that while the drug works best on mice genetically engineered to make less of these proteins, human subjects who have MS experience much lower response rates than those without the disease, Dr. Deutsch noted.

""We don't know why some people respond better to the drug while others do not,"" he added. ""It's very difficult to say whether the drug itself is responsible for that difference.""

In fact, he explained, a large number of studies show that TGF-beta1 levels decline after a person stops taking medications used to treat MS. In contrast, Dr. Deutsch said, it takes only about a week of normal activity for blood levels to return to baseline following an",57,multiple sclerosis stages phases,-12.290088653564451,140,no_prompt,3,0.6763285024154589,395,0
gpt2-large_86,"and a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is considered by all to be a major medical event. The primary goal for treatment in this condition is not cure, but rather improvement of symptoms. Treatment with medications such as methylprednisolone (MPA) or prednisolone plus prednisolone (PPS), which can prevent the progression of MS, has become more common over time.

The use of MPA and PPS in combination have been shown to prolong survival times from disease onset up to 10 years post-MS diagnosis compared with untreated control subjects.5,6 Furthermore, patients who receive either medication often experience improved quality of life following treatment.7–9 There are currently no long-term studies on the efficacy of combining MPA and PPS for maintenance treatment with MS, however it remains an option if other treatments fail.10–12

Because a number of side effects associated with both drugs may occur at higher doses than prescribed, researchers have sought alternatives.13 Several new agents are now available that are approved for prevention of the progression of MS in adults.14,15 These include cyclosporine (CYC),16,17 a cyclic nucleotide analog that inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2);18 cimetidine,19 a nitroso compound that blocks COX activity;20 phenylbutazone,21 a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate derivative that acts as both COX inhibitor and inducer;22 and doxorubicin,23 a selective COX inhibitor that can also act as an inducer. Although these agents represent novel approaches to management of MS, their long-term safety profile is still unclear.

We conducted a multicenter, randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of CYC therapy in patients diagnosed with progressive multiple sclerosis after 1 year on high dose CYC-treated regimens. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 2 cycles per week of 2 mg/kg MPA or 3 cycles per week of 4 mg/kg MPA starting at 12 weeks. Study participants received oral antiplatelet treatment between 14 and 20 weeks. We assessed safety in this clinical trial by obtaining information on adverse events reported during study intervention.

Sleep disorders such as insomnia (including depression) are also associated with increased risk of MS, although this has been limited by a lack of studies on patients without MS.

A study published last year in Nature Neuroscience found that when mice with MS got two-thirds of their calories from food (rather than 40 percent), they had more neurons, or brain cells, than mice who ate 50 percent of their calories from fat and protein. They also showed greater improvements in brain function in response to tests measuring memory and learning, researchers reported. The findings could provide clues as to why people have so many cognitive problems.

The same research team has now shown that when mice were given high doses of vitamin D before and after being treated for multiple sclerosis, their ability to fight off infections increased by up to 100 times compared to mice fed only regular chow. Vitamin D is known to help prevent autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, but it can also play an important role in treating other conditions — including depression and some cancers.

The study results were published online Nov. 6 by the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.

""There are some people that have developed type 2 diabetes,"" said Dr. David Vlachos, chief of cardiology at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center and lead author on the paper. ""And so there was this assumption that there would be some sort of association between BMI and type 2 diabetes.""

But when they looked more carefully at the data, ""what we found was very striking,"" he added.

In the researchers' calculations, the average person had about 1.5 times the risk of developing type 2 diabetes if their weight rose from his or her current body mass index, or BMI, of 25 to 29.9 compared with those who fell within that range, but only one to two times as much risk of type 2 diabetes if the BMI jumped above 30. The risk climbed steadily higher for each additional point gained above 25, reaching nearly three times the risk for those over 40 years old.

When it came to risk factors related to weight gain, the authors were particularly surprised. People with high BMIs tended to get worse health outcomes — including heart disease and diabetes — and did not seem to experience any benefit from losing weight. That could indicate that overweight individuals aren't gaining weight because of health problems, Vlachos explained. Rather, they may have become obese through stress, dieting or other mechanisms.

Other studies suggest similar patterns among people with type 2 diabetes. A 2008 study led by Drs. Frank Hu of Harvard Medical School and Dr. Robert Lustig of Boston University suggested that people whose BMI was greater than 25 were five times more likely to develop diabetes than people whose BMI was less than 24. Another analysis of a sample of people with Type 2 Diabetes in Australia, published last year, showed that overweight patients were twice as likely to develop diabetes when their BMI increased by 12 points or more than that of leaner individuals.",113,asthma and covid,-11.670598030090332,195,no_prompt,3,0.8904109589041096,363,7

Place a piece of thick foam rollers on your bench and place them next to you on top of your shoulders. Start by picking up one of your weights and placing it under the second dumbbell. Next you need to pick up two more weight and hold them on the side until they are both pressed against each other. Move around the bench using all three dumbbells until you have reached your desired total number. Repeat this process with another set of dumbbells. After completing these two sets, get ready to do the same thing with your third weight.

Psychotherapy, you know, basically the therapy of healing ourselves from our trauma, and also, you know, getting some kind of closure with what happened to us, but also understanding that it's not just a traumatic experience, that it has been going on for at least 100 years or more in terms of how we've learned to see other people as objects.

How does I tell if my baby is sick?

If your child has any signs of illness like fever, pain, rash, skin rash, or an unexplained weight gain, call your doctor right away. If you have a history of allergy symptoms like hives, runny nose, cough, sneezing or trouble breathing and are concerned about your child's health, contact your doctor immediately.

What should I do if my baby is sick?

For infants, it is important to monitor them closely for signs of illness. You can also use one of the following methods:

Ask your pediatrician whether they think a baby might be ill. They may know whether your infant is on immunoglobulin A (IgA) treatment by seeing how often he or she gets a positive IgE test result. If your child is not getting better after three weeks on this medication, get more information from your provider. Your provider will likely recommend that you see a registered dietitian, pharmacist, allergist or other healthcare professional who can work with you in determining what treatment plan works best for you and your baby.

If your child appears fine after four weeks of receiving an anti-allergy shot at home, ask your pediatrician for advice on treating her as soon as possible so that your child doesn't develop chronic illnesses later in life.

You can make an appointment to visit your physician with your child at least 4–6 weeks before your child's first birthday and every six months until you're sure your child is healthy enough to go back into school.

If your child seems okay but you're still worried about him, talk with your child's doctor about his medical condition and discuss your concerns about his future health care needs with your child's doctor.

Your child's doctor also may refer you to another specialist. The person who treated your child when he was younger may have specialized training to help diagnose certain types of allergies such as food allergies or hay fever. This type of specialist is called an endocrinologist or an endocrine specialist.",108,chronic diarrhea short-term memory sweating inability to regulate body temperature heart palpitations dysautonomia,-8.327227592468262,21,no_prompt,3,0.3559322033898305,368,6

The type of diabetes you have depends on your genetics and where in your body the damage has occurred. Some people are born with one type of diabetes that can't be removed; others may need to take insulin injections for the rest of their lives. And some people simply get sicker than others.

Treating diabetes

The best way to cure diabetes is to lower your risk by improving lifestyle habits. This includes eating a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol. To do this, increase your intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and protein-rich foods such as eggs, meat and fish. Foods like these help your body use carbs more efficiently so it doesn't run out when you're hungry. Also, eat plenty of dark green leafy vegetables. These include broccoli, kale, collards and spinach.

People who have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes should also try to avoid high-calorie snacks or sweets. People suffering from Type 1 diabetes must reduce their carbohydrate intake. If they don't, they'll eventually develop diabetes again because there's nothing they can eat that will replace what's eaten.",45,Can diabetes be cured?,-0.0095783425495028,1,no_prompt,3,0.007936507936507936,198,10

6) Headache relief: It's important that you get relief from your headache as soon as possible. This will help prevent further headaches. The easiest way to do this is by taking a nap or a short walk. However, it's also crucial to ensure that the migraine medication you are using is working well with your condition. You should never stop taking your medications without talking to your doctor first.

7) Sleep problems: If you find yourself sleeping badly, it may just mean that you're suffering from insomnia. Sleeping poorly and feeling tired when you wake up is often a symptom of sleep deprivation. To combat sleep deprivation, make sure that you keep your bed clean, use good quality pillows, and take regular naps during the day. If this doesn't work for you, you might consider switching to a different type of mattress or even trying a new type of mattress before buying another.

8) Feeling tired and unfulfilled: Feelings of emptiness and unsatisfiedness usually indicate an underlying health problem that needs addressing. This could mean that you're having difficulty focusing on anything at all because your mind is too busy thinking about everything else around you and the world outside your window.

The FDA's decision, however, will not affect a number of other products that the agency has approved in the past for use by people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who are prescribed steroids as part of their treatment plan. The FDA also decided not to delay approval of an asthma inhaler product from Bayer CropScience for the same reasons: there was no indication the drug could worsen bronchial asthma.

""I am pleased that the FDA has determined that we can continue to administer this medication to patients who have been granted exemption under the new rule,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Kripke, chief medical officer at Asthma Inc., which sells AstraZeneca and Merck products under its own brand names, including Actavis, Zyrtec and Vioxx, respectively. ""We have long supported the FDA's position on this issue because the burden placed upon our industry is disproportionate when compared to many others.""

But there were some unanswered questions.

And several prominent companies, including Amgen and Abbott Laboratories, have filed lawsuits against the agency, arguing the decision unfairly discriminates against them.

What Causes It?

The exact cause is unknown, although some studies suggest that certain genes play a role. The most well-known genetic factor is the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which cause approximately 30% of breast cancer. Several other genes have been implicated in breast cancers, including the HER2A gene, known for its ability to reduce hormone production in response to estrogen. Although many factors contribute to risk for developing breast cancer, researchers believe the strongest risk factors may be inherited from one's mother, father, and siblings. Other risk factors include being overweight, having high blood pressure, smoking cigarettes, and eating too much red meat or processed foods. A genetic marker associated with risk also appears on the X chromosome and can affect whether women conceive after having children. An important consideration regarding this particular gene is the fact that there is no way to prevent it. There has never been any successful treatment for it.

It's also possible that it could be something else, such as a chromosomal abnormality that affects how cells produce their own hormones, causing them to make different substances than normal cells do. Some research suggests that tumors might arise because of abnormal changes in DNA; others indicate that it could be caused by mutations in genes involved in metabolism, such as enzymes or proteins. Also, genetic abnormalities can cause problems during pregnancy, which can lead to miscarriage and premature delivery.

I wonder if someone could tell me what was going on with this guy and have him tested for MS? I don't think he would be taking any more medication then he usually does. He would be sleeping less and eating better. Not everyone who has the disease responds well to medication. I don't know how common that is though. We do know that people who are in remission on anti-MS drugs will still go back to the old routine of getting up in the morning, showering, cooking food, putting things away, etc. A month or so later they'll just be like ""hey, time to hit the gym again"" or whatever. And then one day they'll wake up and find themselves in their office all sweaty, bloodied and complaining about headaches because they're tired of waking up every single day at 4am and going to work! The average person with MS can't function in a normal way during the day because of how much pain they get from daily activity. This is why there aren't many doctors out there who treat MS patients during the day. They really don't want to see anyone else being sick, or having MS symptoms, for fear of losing business. So I guess we all just pray that the patient gets better soon enough, and that eventually somebody finally takes notice and decides to take them seriously.

This is very helpful to understand! Thank you. I've been thinking a lot lately about this. I've had a few recurring thoughts that keep popping up in my head:

If you didn't already know, MS is very severe. You might think that it's pretty easy to recover if you are willing to accept that your body will always respond poorly to treatment. But when I read about those little tiny bumps that seem to pop up in the MS brain I feel hopelessly defeated, because I know I am doing everything right… It hurts so badly, but I couldn't live without these little bumps….

But why does that make them worse? Is it a response to the pain? Or is there an underlying problem somewhere? If the first thing to come to mind is that they are caused by the pain…then obviously it doesn't matter how bad it feels. I hope some day I can get to grips with that and move forward.

The new study was led by Dr. Mihai Toma at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. It involved 11 patients who had Stage II-IV breast cancer that had not responded to either chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The patients were randomized to one of three different treatments: dasatinib (10 mg/m2 per day) for four months; tamoxifen (1 g twice daily) for six weeks, followed by four more cycles of ten mg/kg per week; or placebo (100 µg cetuximab once per month). Results showed that patients on dasatinib achieved a 75% reduction in tumors during each cycle of 10 mg/kg per week compared to those taking the other therapies. Patients treated with tamoxifen also saw an 82% response rate when they started on 10 mg/m2 per day.

""This is the first time any drug has been shown to have such sustained and profound results,"" said Toma. ""And we are now beginning to understand how it works.""

Dasatinib (biotinib), known as the most potent anti-cancer agent currently available for treating malignant melanoma, also reduced tumor weight, as well as reducing the number of cells within tumors. Researchers believe this may be because it helps to destroy the underlying signaling pathways that cause tumors to grow. And a large majority of the patients in this study received multiple doses of tamoxifen during their cancer treatments, which may also contribute to its effectiveness. Tamoxifen has already been approved for use in women with endometrial cancers because of the fact that it reduces ovarian cancer risk while lowering the risk of recurrence. But tamoxifen's ability to reduce metastases remains unknown.

Tamas says that these results could lead to the development of a new class of drugs for people who have advanced malignancies, such as men with prostate cancer. He says he sees hope for patients like his patient, who he hopes will respond to more aggressive therapy.

We don't know.

Some women with MS are diagnosed with early onset MS, but most will not have any clinical manifestation of MS before age 50. So we need a better understanding of the disease in order to determine the role that MS plays in these changes in hormone levels. However, it's likely that many women with MS who become menopausal will still have symptoms of MS at age 60 or 70. We don't know which ones.

What is the impact of hormone replacement therapy on MS symptoms?

This is an area of ongoing research and needs to be clarified further by the FDA as part of its consideration for new drug approval. There are studies suggesting that, contrary to what we've been told in the past, there may be some beneficial effects from estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) on MS symptomatology; however, more importantly, because ERT affects hormones such as progesterone that play important roles in the regulation of sexual function and immune responses, there is also a risk that this treatment could potentially increase the rate of recurrence of MS.


Do you think that the recent decision by the FDA to remove estrogen from their list of approved drugs is going to affect women's access to ERT treatment?

It may.

If you consider that women account for only 3% of all U.S. users of prescription medicines, that means that about 30 million American women will not get an ERT prescription based on the current criteria. The FDA has stated that they want to make sure that women can get ERT if they have certain medical conditions. But if women with MRKH have other medical problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, or preexisting uterine fibroids that impair ovarian function, then they should receive an ERT prescription, regardless of whether they receive any form of estrogen replacement therapy.

When does the time frame begin for deciding whether someone with MS should use hormone replacement therapy or not?

The FDA has set up a process where women can ask if they should be prescribed ERT, and if so what kind. After an initial interview with a doctor, a woman may proceed to a second visit, after she receives an additional assessment of her health status. In both cases, the physician will determine if estrogen replacement therapy should continue or be stopped. Once a person decides to take ERT, the patient will receive a letter explaining why they believe their condition warrants the medication.

Introduction

In this tutorial I will present you with a few concepts that will help you understand the world of ecology.

We will learn about ecosystems in general, as well as the problems they may present for our everyday life. In particular, we shall discuss the dynamics of ecosystems, which lead to their degradation, and how people can best address them through sustainable management. We'll also learn about global trends towards destruction of biodiversity and other species. Finally, we'll explore some of the key issues associated with environmental health – environmental toxins and pollutants, food safety, the environment's role in human development – all of which have implications both for societies and individuals.

The course is divided into three parts: Introduction to Ecology, Environmental Health, and Social Change.

Chapter 1 – Introduction to Ecology Part A – Introduction The purpose of this section will be to introduce the basic idea of ecology before moving onto the topics covered by the rest of the chapters. This chapter contains information pertaining to ecosystems (including the history of how humans have created them), and provides background information concerning many commonly used terms such as ecosystem, ecosystem services, and ecocentricity. By doing so, this introduction will not only educate you about the concept of ecology, but also explain its origins. Chapter 2 – Environment Part B – Environment Part B explains how the atmosphere has evolved over time; why CO2 emissions are happening today, and the consequences of climate change. It introduces us to the different types of gases, oxygen, temperature, sunlight, cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed, humidity, etc. It then explores the major factors driving changes to each type of factor and discusses them at great length. It concludes with a discussion of potential solutions and predictions for each of these variables. Chapter 3 – Social Change Part C – Social Change In this part of the course, you will be introduced to the evolution of the social structure throughout history (primarily within the context of the Industrial Revolution). You will be given a brief overview of the evolution of government institutions, including democracy, capitalism, and socialism.

gpt2-large_35,"If you're insulin resistant, there's no way around it: If you eat low-carb and high-fat (especially if your goal is to lose weight) then the body will try to use up all of that stored fat in your belly – not just glucose. This can be very dangerous, as excess glucose can lead to hypoglycemia or even diabetes! Insulin resistance means that there are fewer cells in the pancreas that can produce insulin which leads to increased blood sugar levels which may cause problems later on in life (though many people manage this successfully without medication). However, low carbohydrate diets have been shown to help reverse diabetes by reducing blood sugar and cholesterol levels while also improving insulin sensitivity, so they've been used by diabetics since the 1950s. The most important thing is to find a diet that works well for you and is easy for you to stick to. For example, I'd recommend starting from a baseline ketogenic diet but adjusting what you add when necessary to get more results. But remember, even though ketosis causes less insulin resistance than regular fasting, a ketogenic diet doesn't mean that you should ignore traditional fasted foods like potatoes, pasta etc.

What is the difference between ketosis and ketones? Do both types of metabolism exist? Can both exist at the same time?

There are two different ways of getting rid of calories – fasting and ketosis. Fasting actually reduces your calorie intake, whereas ketosis gets rid of some of them – by burning fats for fuel instead. Ketone bodies are produced during starvation (which happens often during chronic stress), but during ketosis your body uses fat for energy – this is why ketosis has become popular in recent years. In addition to being able to burn fat, you need ketones in order to break down protein and carbohydrates into usable form – it's the mechanism behind the ""keto"" effect, which makes it easier to stick to any ketogenic diet. It's also an excellent tool for helping you stay healthy, which can only come about through constant exposure to nutrient dense food; in other words, if you don't eat enough, then you won't have the energy to recover fully afterwards.

What you need to know

The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that adults and adolescents age 18 and older engage in regular moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for at least 30 minutes a week, such as brisk walking or running, on most days. Those who are overweight or obese should increase their activity level to at least 150 minutes per week or at least 50 minutes a day if they are sedentary. Women should also get 150 minutes of moderate-intensity daily activity. (Exercise is good for women's reproductive health, but not men.)

To avoid weight gain, limit your activity level to 90 minutes or less each day and focus on shorter distance runs, biking or jogging. If you have difficulty maintaining regular exercise levels, consider starting a walk program. A healthy diet may help keep you active while eating right and losing weight.

A study published last year found that physically inactive individuals had more heart disease than those who were exercising regularly. The research was led by Drs. Robert C. Cantu, David J. Karp, William F. Schaffner and Jeffrey D. Siegel of the Stanford University School of Medicine and published in Circulation. It looked at data from 1.6 million participants aged 20 to 85 years old from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which followed over 7.5 million people across 5 countries. These participants also filled out questionnaires assessing smoking habits, body mass index and other factors.

The most common cause for finger pain is from friction when you touch your fingers to each other. Your finger and hand may become very cold after some time on a hot surface (such as the floor). This causes your fingertips to rub together rather than grip them tightly. You then place an object in front of your fingers that prevents the rubbing. The object could be something like a shoe, a piece of clothing, a book, etc. If this does not help, contact your doctor immediately because it could lead to more finger problems.

The risk of death from pregnancy complications is much higher than the risk of death from any other cause, including infection (particularly bacterial), infections during childbirth and related complications during early life, or a low birth weight.

Infants born to women who have never had an abortion are at increased risk for:

High blood pressure

Liver disease

Premature rupture of membranes

Bladder cancer

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)

Pregnant women who smoke during their pregnancies increase their risk of miscarriage. This is especially true if they smoke while pregnant. Smoking increases the chances of delivering a small baby with major abnormalities. In addition, smoking impairs your ability to deliver healthy babies. Smokers should not be given access to abortion services until after 20 weeks gestation if they intend to become pregnant again.

In addition, the pregnancy rate in states where abortion was banned has dropped dramatically as more people choose to terminate unwanted pregnancies.

The researchers also found that when they used a drug called oxytocin to reduce cortisol levels in rats, they did not increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease over time.

""These results are consistent with the notion that there is no such thing as an 'all or nothing' drug treatment,"" said Dr. Daniel Schwartz, lead author on the paper and a professor at Columbia University Medical Center. ""There are different treatments for each condition.""

In their study, published today (Feb. 2) in the journal Cell Metabolism, the researchers analyzed data from 776 people who were followed up after they had received one of four experimental drugs: oxytocin, a single dose of steroids to prevent ovulation; a placebo for menopausal symptoms; testosterone injections to lower blood pressure; or an aromatase inhibitor to improve sperm count and motility.

For each individual, they looked at the frequency of various diseases and outcomes — like death, disability or stroke — as well as other factors related to both the disease onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease.

They found that those taking oxytocin showed less brain atrophy than those taking a placebo and that men with early stages of Alzheimer's had a better outcome in terms of the number of strokes and death than men without Alzheimer's. Also, women with early stage Alzheimer's had better outcomes than those without it. In addition, they saw little difference between those who took oxytocin or those who took steroids. They say these findings suggest that this hormone may be contributing to certain aspects of disease.

However, in contrast to previous studies, they noted that these results weren't statistically significant due to small numbers. Other research has shown that the benefits of oxytocin do not last past five years, suggesting that it might have benefits over a longer period of time.

This new study provides more support for the idea that the human body contains a natural immune system that can fight off Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders. The authors suggest that future research should look at whether these same mechanisms could serve to protect against Parkinson's disease and possibly even some types of cancer.",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-12.42376708984375,139,no_prompt,4,0.6813725490196079,368,0
gpt2-large_54,"MS is an autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction of myelin – a protective coating on nerve cells. The immune system attacks myelin to protect neurons and other tissue from infection or injury. If you have MS, the immune system will try to destroy your brain and nervous system, leading to progressive weakness and loss of movement. Symptoms can begin within 3 months after symptoms appear, so you may not know you've had MS until years later.

The signs and symptoms of MS are similar in all people with the disease but some conditions make it more noticeable than others. For example, if you have one of these conditions:

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)

Alzheimer's disease

Parkinson's disease

Some forms of epilepsy — including Dravet Syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and Temporal Focal Epilepsy

Many types of cancer that affect nerves, such as Leukemia, lymphoma, sarcoma and head and neck cancers. Some of these diseases also affect muscle.

What causes multiple sclerosis?

Multiple sclerosis occurs when an abnormal reaction to certain stimuli leads to damage to different parts of the brain or spinal cord. This usually takes place as a result of infections. However, a number of things can cause a person with MS to develop the condition. These include:

A serious illness. A virus like the flu or polio could spread through blood transfusion or a contaminated vaccine.

Certain drugs. People who take medicines for mental health problems might be at greater risk of developing MS. The list includes anti-psychotic medications, antidepressants, beta blockers and chemotherapy. Taking them regularly could increase the chance of getting MS.

Complications from treatments that help treat MS. In addition to worsening pain, treatment with steroids or anticonvulsants may worsen inflammation in the central nervous system (the part of the body responsible for controlling impulses and controlling movements). These side effects can lead to severe disability.

Preventing MS

If there was no risk of MS during pregnancy, women shouldn't get pregnant unless they're diagnosed early enough.

Women should ask their doctor before getting a tattoo, piercing or new nose or mouthpiece because the needles can carry bacteria and viruses into the fetus and increase the chances of having a baby with a genetic disorder. Also keep out of reach of children younger than 10 years old.

gpt2-large_51,"The term 'holistic' means that the patient's health should be prioritized over any single factor. It would not make sense to focus on the individual components of an illness, but instead consider its overall picture.

So, for example, if we were dealing with someone who had a heart condition, our first consideration might be to check the blood pressure in her veins. We would then look at other symptoms such as fatigue or joint pain, before coming to the conclusion that her heart problem may have something more serious going on.

In this way, holistic approaches are able to address all aspects of a disease. This includes how the body reacts to stressors (like high levels of cortisol), how drugs affect brain function (such as lowering serotonin) or even which medicines work best. The main reason why these kinds of issues are addressed through integrative therapies is because they do not focus solely on one aspect of a disorder.

For example, in order to treat depression, doctors typically use medications and psychotherapy. However, the whole point is not just to manage depression; rather, it's about improving overall functioning by reducing depressive symptoms. For someone suffering from PTSD, the same thing can happen — taking out your medication will only result in a worse state of mind. The key is to ensure that treatment focuses on improving overall well-being rather than trying to tackle an individual symptom or drug side effect.

How are the different treatments implemented? Is it done with a pharmacist or homeopathic doctor? How long should the therapy last?

All of these things are determined by a practitioner. In order to be effective, the therapist needs to know his patients well, understand their problems, and gain enough experience to identify how to improve them further. Often a doctor doesn't always provide complete information. When that happens, practitioners usually refer patients directly to pharmacists (or homeopaths).

There are many different ways to implement the various therapeutic options, including homeopathy, acupuncture, ayurveda, chiropractic, Reiki and even herbalism. In most cases, practitioners will talk you through their recommendations and recommend a complementary medicine remedy. If you're using a prescription drug, there also sometimes is a recommendation made on the label.

Although some people prefer to buy their own medicines online, this isn't recommended. Some companies sell unregulated or unapproved products, which puts patients at risk.

The researchers were able to show that people with the condition had significantly higher levels of serotonin in their blood than people without a problem, suggesting that they may have a genetic predisposition for the disease. It's not yet clear whether that is because of an altered neurochemistry or some other reason. But it's worth noting: the study did not include patients who suffered from depression and anxiety.

In one instance, the team examined what happens when someone with OCD (and other obsessive compulsive disorders) engages in repetitive activities like reading or watching television. They found a significant reduction in serotonin in patients, as well as changes in the brain activity associated with those behaviors, such as increased activity in the area known as the ventral striatum, which is associated with feelings of excitement. Interestingly, this same region also plays a role in addiction, according to the researchers.

The study, published in The Lancet Neurology journal, looked at the role of glucocorticoids, an important class of hormones that are widely used to treat a variety of conditions including epilepsy and inflammatory bowel disease. But as part of a larger project funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), researchers found that one particular type of steroid may not be the best treatment for MS.

In their analysis of 42 MS patients with relapses who were treated using glucocorticoid therapy, they found that only 22 percent responded well to this drug while 75 percent had severe relapses or worsening symptoms after 12 months. Moreover, these patients did not respond to other treatments including standard drugs like steroids, oral steroids, and nerve blockers.

Glycoprotein hormone-1, another molecule produced by the body and involved in many bodily functions, is commonly referred to as ""the big g."" GHR-1 has been implicated in numerous autoimmune disorders, including autoimmunity, Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. It also regulates immune function. One type of antibody known as anti-GHR-1 antibodies can trigger the production of cytokines in response to any stimuli—which, in turn, helps trigger inflammation. In addition, when a person develops acute flareups of MS, they often experience more severe flares than people without MS because there is less time for their cells to heal themselves.

GHR-1 antibodies may play a critical role in triggering the destruction of new nerve fibers during the early stages of MS, but once those nerves have developed properly, the production of other inflammatory factors stops. This could help explain why a significant percentage of those without MS also have flare ups, says Dr. Steven Nissenbaum, lead author of the study and professor of neurology at Boston University School of Medicine.

""We want to know if we can figure out how glucocorticoids affect immune responses,"" says Nissenbaum, explaining that this was a first step toward understanding how certain types of drugs affect immunity. He and his colleagues then studied whether patients who took glucocorticoids responded better to cortisone, which blocks some levels of GHR-1. They discovered that two doses of cortisone combined with glucocorticoid therapy caused a 10 percent reduction in GHR-1 antibody titres compared with a placebo group.

Type: Anxiety, ADD

The Diagnosis: Anxiety or ADD is a common diagnosis. While ADHD is usually diagnosed in adults, some children have the condition as well. Some people with ADD also struggle with other mental health issues including depression and substance abuse. The symptoms of ADD can be similar to those associated with OCD, but it tends to manifest differently. This is why treatment for ADD often involves behavioral changes that help regulate and reduce stress levels and improve attention span. ADHD can lead to feelings of worthlessness if untreated, which can affect your academic performance, relationships with friends and family members, and quality of life. People suffering from ADD may also experience social isolation, anxiety, impulsivity, poor self-image and general feeling of being overwhelmed. You might wonder how you could ever manage so many different mental illnesses at once. But there are ways to cope. Many medications have been found effective when used in conjunction with therapy. For example, lithium has been shown to relieve symptoms of ADD without causing withdrawal reactions in adults and children. Other drugs have had success treating ADHD in combination with certain antidepressants. These medications don't need to be taken all day every day and can do the job more effectively. Treatment for ADHD typically consists of behavior modification programs and psychotherapy that address your emotions and behaviors rather than just the symptoms of ADD. Medications can be combined with cognitive behavioral therapies such as CBT or exposure and response prevention (ERP).

The main advantage is that, unlike other medications, a single dose can be taken with food. However, there are many side effects, including weight gain and gastrointestinal problems. Also, some patients find the treatment time limited due to side effects. A second option for controlling MS symptoms is a combination of drugs called immunosuppressants. These include drugs such as prednisolone, prednisolone hydrochloride and prednisolone sulfate; combined with other drugs, such as cycloserine.

Other treatments include surgery for lesions caused by the disease, stem cell therapy, nerve stimulation and electrical brain stimulation (ECT), and corticosteroids (see below for more information on these treatments).

What else should I know about Multiple Sclerosis?

Multiple sclerosis affects approximately 1 in 100 people worldwide and is estimated to affect between 2 million and 6 million individuals in the United States alone. About 75% to 80% of cases occur within the first few years after the onset of symptoms. During this time, the immune system's response to infection increases, causing inflammation of various tissues. This process, known as autoimmunity, leads to changes to cells throughout the body. In addition to worsening symptoms, many autoimmune diseases cause other complications. For example, osteoporosis, heart attack, diabetes, stroke, cancer and cognitive impairment are all associated with autoimmune disorders. Autoimmune diseases also increase your risk of developing chronic pain and fatigue.

There is no cure for multiple sclerosis. Treatment depends on how well the body responds to specific therapies, which may require adjusting diet, exercise, medication or both.

I was surprised to find that the problem was not just Microsoft Word, but all of those other word-processing programs as well. In fact, I found one program that even made it through the entire test run without a problem: Excel. But Excel wasn't just any spreadsheet program. It's an application for manipulating data that is used by millions of businesses across America and around the world. And yet Excel has a huge number of problems. So why did it pass this test? The answer may surprise you.

The good news is that Microsoft recognizes these problems. The bad news is that they still haven't come up with a solution. This week, at the Windows 8 Developer Conference, we learned the answer: It can be fixed if companies follow a simple step-by-step process outlined here.

You need a clear view of what you need to work on in your office

When someone brings their computer into an office, he or she expects to see everything they need to accomplish. He or she wants a clean workspace, no messy folders to pick apart and organize. However, the reality is that we rarely see everything that needs doing — especially when using computers and software. When we use the internet, we might check Facebook while working. We browse our email while in meetings. We open multiple files at once while editing documents. If we want a clear view of what we should work on and where, then everyone will benefit from having a clear view of what's important. By putting an icon next to every folder and file that makes sense (or at least shows where it goes), we are able to quickly find what we need and move on to more important things.

As we move around our office, we sometimes bring laptops and tablets with us. As soon as these devices touch down, we get a notification that says, ""Your PC/laptop has been detected."" In response, we close the device, unplug it from our power source, remove the battery from it, and put it back together again. In many cases, our PC starts itself up immediately so we don't miss out on anything important. In others, we wait for a few minutes until the system automatically turns itself off and leaves us free to work",95,Reading problems in MS,-11.424881935119627,184,no_prompt,4,0.8720379146919431,430,7

In some cases it's not even clear what happened. At least one company — Sony, which has been in business since 1975 — says it had no idea its batteries leaked; others say they did know but didn't do anything about it. In all likelihood, however, battery-related problems were more prevalent than those involving electronic components or software. The two main ways in which power plants use energy are through burning coal to generate electricity or producing steam, both of which require a large amount of fossil fuels. But power companies can also sell excess electricity back into the grid at whatever price they want, as long as their customers don't get too many complaints from consumers. If you're going to burn coal or steam, why go after a battery? Why not just buy a new plant or power station that could replace it, right? So far, that hasn't turned out quite so well. There is an inherent flaw with that strategy: It leaves no room for innovation. And if you have innovators and engineers working on something like this, how can you get it fixed when nobody knows exactly what went wrong? What would happen if someone came up with a better way to store energy, or a cheaper way to produce it? Or if somebody figured out how to recharge these batteries faster, instead of charging it over night? What would be done if somebody figured out how to improve these batteries without causing them to catch fire? (The answer is usually ""not much."")

This study was a prospective cohort study that assessed the association between body weight, waist circumference and total mortality in women aged 35-44 years, with adjustment for age, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity levels and other lifestyle factors (including use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs) at baseline.

Participants were asked to complete an individual self-administered questionnaire on their anthropometric characteristics at baseline. They were also asked about any medical history, including chronic conditions (e.g. diabetes mellitus, hypertension, asthma), current or previous diagnosis of cancer and cardiovascular disease and specific causes of death. The participants' body mass index was calculated as weight (kg/m2) divided by height squared (in meters). Subjects who reported being overweight or obese were classified according to the WHO criteria for overweight and obesity [4]. In order to determine whether waist circumference would be associated with higher risks for future fatal and nonfatal coronary heart diseases, we used Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for potential confounders such as age, cigarette smoking, family history of MI, low HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes status, intake of multivitamins and vitamin D, and intakes of fruits and vegetables, high-fat dairy products, red meat, alcohol, aspirin, magnesium supplements and multivitamin/mineral tablets. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and SEs from random effects models using P values obtained from Cox regression models (see below).

All statistical tests were two-sided. All p values are statistically significant unless otherwise stated.

Treatment Options for Multiple Sclerosis Symptoms

There are many different ways to treat MS in various forms:

Surgery to remove a diseased area called a lesion.

Chemotherapy (chemotherapy). This is sometimes used after surgery as it can slow down the progression of the disease. It also includes certain medications that kill harmful cells. Sometimes these drugs, such as Avonex (tadalafil), also prevent or delay some of the symptoms of MS. These medicines include Celebrex (vardenafil), Pfizer's Pristiq (irinotecan), Gilead Sciences' Sovaldi (simeprevir/tenofovir/emtricitabine), Sanofi-Aventis' Eliquis (ritonavir) and Roche's Zepatier (ritonavir)

The current phase is a double blind placebo controlled trial (DBS) of natalizumab in patients with relapsing-remitting MS to assess the safety and tolerability of this drug in people who are currently treated for other disease states or are not at high risk of developing other types of MS.

In its Phase 2a, open label, randomized, double-blind study, investigators from Columbia University School of Medicine, New York State Psychiatric Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Medical Center and Harvard Medical School were conducting an open label extension of the DBS Phase 1b trial conducted by investigators at Columbia. In this extension they were evaluating the safety and tolerability profile of both natalizumab as well as placebo in 675 patients who received either one of four doses: 300 mg every 4 weeks; 600 mg every 3 months; 800 mg once daily; and 1200 mg twice weekly. Natalizumab was administered through injections into the arm. All participants provided written informed consent prior to participation in any study.

During each treatment period, participants completed 24-hour ambulatory assessments using an objective measure of disability scores that was previously validated for the SDS-11. These measures were compared between groups during the course of each treatment period. Natalizumab also met the requirements set forth by FDA for approval of an investigational new drug application (IND). This IND had an approved indication for the use of natalizumab in relapsing-remitting MS. It included data on overall objective response rates (ORR), the proportion of responders with response versus nonresponders after two consecutive cycles; a composite score (CR; response rate divided by total CR over time); and a composite measure of side effects including headaches, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, rash, muscle stiffness and pain. Researchers looked for adverse events associated with administration of all dosing regimens and evaluated them when possible.

No serious adverse reactions (AEs) were reported in connection with natalizumab. However, several AEs occurred more frequently in participants receiving higher dose and/or long duration of therapy than those in those receiving lower dose and/or shorter duration of therapy. Some common causes include increased bleeding (injection site reaction), headache, fever, gastrointestinal upset, fatigue, depression, skin rashes and itching. No deaths have been recorded in these trials, but researchers noted some discontinuation due to low numbers of eligible participants during treatment periods.

Although MS has been widely recognized for decades, it has received less attention than other forms of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.2 In fact, some studies suggest that MS may be even more common than previously thought.3-5 As a result, clinicians have not focused on how to prevent this devastating disease, and MS patients are likely unaware they have an increased risk of developing other health problems in later life.6,7

The new findings from our group demonstrate that high levels of inflammation (a hallmark of MS) can interfere with insulin signaling pathways involved in glucose metabolism by preventing the activation of key genes involved in energy homeostasis. This interferes with development of tissues necessary for normal muscle function, heart rate, blood pressure, and fluid balance, which leads to muscle weakness, weakness of the limbs, and impaired mobility in the limbs. These detrimental changes cause chronic pain and fatigue, as well as cognitive dysfunction.8-10

These findings provide further evidence that inflammation plays a role in the genesis of MS and could lead to improved treatment approaches and prevention strategies.

A New Understanding of Interfering Factors in MS Pathogenesis

In order to understand the mechanisms leading to MS pathogenesis and potential prevention approaches, we examined genes associated with inflammation in relation to its impact on MS severity and disease progression in mice models of MS. Our data confirmed previous reports that alterations in inflammatory proteins play a significant role in the initiation and progression of MS ( ).11,12 Moreover, these same data showed that systemic cytokines were also linked to the onset and/or progression of MS in both C57BL/6J mice and DBA/2J mice.13

First, we found that elevated expression of proinflammatory factors were strongly correlated with lower MS activity at baseline after 5 weeks of disease induction. This finding suggests that chronic inflammation may serve to inhibit MS activity in humans and animals through reducing the ability of innate immune cells to respond appropriately to a wide variety of stimuli.14 Second, we observed a dose-dependent relationship between altered proinflammatory gene expression and the severity of MS pathology in the spinal cord. Importantly, we did not observe any correlation between the level of proinflammatory transcripts seen in healthy tissue and MS lesions observed using immunohistochemistry.

""It's an exciting time for us,"" says Dr. John O'Connor, a radiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and leader of the research team. ""Our findings provide important information about what happens in men as they age.""

The researchers studied more than 1,400 men with advanced stage prostate cancer who had been treated with radiation therapy. All had been diagnosed between 1996 and 2008 at Boston University School of Medicine. Most were white, middle-aged or older and lived in Massachusetts. Nearly all had received the same two drugs: temozolomide (TZD) and raloxifene (CAS-91471), both manufactured by Bristol Myers Squibb. The treatments had stopped work when the men reached 40 years old.

The results showed that TZD was associated with a lower risk of death from prostate cancer compared with raloxifene — a finding consistent with previous studies, says lead author Dr. Kevin Mottram, MD, PhD, professor of radiology and biomedical sciences at Harvard Medical School. It is also consistent with earlier reports of a small increase in mortality among men taking temozolomide after menopause.

Among men aged 50 to 69 years who did not receive any treatment for prostate cancer, men in the highest quartile of radiation exposure — those who spent more than four hours per month exposed to radiation — died from prostate cancer at 18% higher rates than men in the lowest group of exposure, those who never took radiation. This association persisted even after accounting for factors such as age, race, body mass index and other medical history, all considered known risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

Mottram notes that men in this cohort may have experienced greater physical activity during their lifetimes because they worked longer shifts, which could also influence the risks of radiation exposure. He believes it will take some further analysis to determine whether radiation exposure may have affected survival.

In addition, he explains, previous research has shown that men living in areas where radiation levels are high tend to get worse outcomes over time, so additional analyses should examine long-term mortality effects.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that women who have never smoked should try to quit, but there's no firm evidence that e-cigarettes work as well or at all for people who are smokers. In a study published this month in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, researchers examined the effects of nicotine on mice with breast cancer, finding that it increased their survival rate from about two weeks after diagnosis until five years after surgery. But nicotine also increased tumor growth by 25 percent, so the results don't mean that e-cigarette use will give you much more than that.

So what is smoking? It begins innocently enough: Your friends have a cigarette in one hand and they're making a point of letting you know not to smoke around them. They call it ""smoking."" After your friend gets knocked out, he says, ""You don't need to start smoking,"" because he knows you're still breathing. That's when the idea of quitting takes hold—and the smoker feels like an idiot. ""It's just not worth it!"" The person won't get over the urge to smoke again.

Smoking kills more Americans than any other cause of death, which makes sense given its widespread popularity among young adults. At any given moment, nearly 10 million American teenagers say they smoke cigarettes daily. And many of these kids aren't even aware that they're doing anything wrong. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only 14 percent of high school seniors and 19 percent of middle school students report being current smokers. Only 20 percent of eighth graders and 22 percent of twelfth graders admit to having tried tobacco products themselves.

Most smokers feel confused about whether they've really done something wrong. When asked about their first step toward stopping, about half of cigarette users cite withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, fatigue, depression and anxiety, and about two thirds cite getting high. Yet studies show that most quitting attempts are successful only if they involve smoking less regularly or quitting completely. As recently as 2007, when the CDC first published its National Smoking Trends Survey, almost three quarters of adult smokers reported using e-cigarettes or vaping devices within the previous year. A decade later, fewer than one third do. In 2011, a survey conducted by the US Surgeon General found that 43 percent of smokers had used e-cigarettes at some time during the past 12 months. By comparison, 16 percent had ever smoked traditional cigarettes. That means roughly 5.8 percent of",113,asthma and covid,-11.375401496887209,193,no_prompt,4,0.8812785388127854,420,8

This time around, I went for a more complex sequence, using the same leg presses and walking lunges that I did with my first routine.

To perform these exercises in this order, start each rep at your lowest weight possible (i.e., a weight you can comfortably press without discomfort). Then pick up the barbell to your shoulders and lower it slowly until you feel the movement of your glutes going through full range of motion. Next, bring the bar back down to just below your knees, which is where most people are comfortable with their elbows on the bench. Hold this position for several seconds, allowing the eccentric portion of the lift to come out from under your body as the gluteal muscles contract. Once you've completed five sets of 10 reps, rest until you're ready to move onto the next set.

Here's what I'd do with the first round:

1) Lower the bar to my midsection and hold it there

2) Perform two repetitions with 90 pounds, but only keep the last rep to about 120 pounds

3) Rest 15 minutes

4) Work up to 45 total reps.

5) Repeat on other side

What I learned from doing these squats was that there were three different ways to go about them:

If I want to train them with heavy weights (the higher the reps, the better), I'll be squatting heavy enough to make me fatigued and then resting a good amount between sets. If I'm trying to get bigger or stronger, I'll have to find something else to do besides squatting. So I'll use some combination of both strategies. Or if I have a great deal of flexibility, I'll also try to get an upper back stretch during each set. Whatever works best for me!

The Results

Over the course of six weeks, I averaged 11.8 reps per workout, with a maximum number of 12 reps of 90 pounds. That means that the average guy who would typically work out to 8.0 reps wouldn't see nearly as much progress during his training period when compared with someone who worked out to 6.6 reps.

You may notice that the averages don't change significantly after six weeks. This isn't because we didn't increase our volume. Quite the opposite; in fact, we actually increased the load by 30 percent! And it was all thanks to the way we trained.

gpt2-large_117,"after a single treatment with tamoxifen (30). However, the use of tamoxifen in this setting has not been well studied. We found that tamoxifen was associated with an increased risk for lung cancer survival to 1 year and for overall mortality. A recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials involving 8 000 patients reported that a daily dose of tamoxifen 400 mg did increase all-cause mortality by 16% compared with placebo [31]. The authors concluded that Tamoxifen is associated with an increased risk for all-cause death and that it may be useful as adjunct therapy in treating patients at high risk for lung cancer.

There are several reasons why a low level of breast cancer might still have good prognosis if she remains on estrogen replacement therapy even though her tumor size increases. Breast tissue contains large amounts of estrogen receptors in the breast lobules, which are located within the glandular epithelium of the dermis. Although most breast cancers do not spread to other parts of the body because they are contained within the breast lobule or lobula, some types can invade adjacent organs such as the lungs, uterus and prostate. There also exists evidence that tamoxifen exposure causes changes in hormone levels that can alter hormone function in the developing brain, leading to adverse effects on the growth and development of the breasts. Other potential mechanisms include alterations in aromatase activity in the liver and pituitary gland and disruption in thyroid hormones produced by the thyroid. These possible mechanisms could lead to malignancy in affected individuals.

A recent review of existing literature suggested that tamoxifen can cause mammary tumors because of its ability to inhibit aromatase [32], as well as effects on estradiol production. However, the only available human study comparing tamoxifen with other pharmacologic agents including natalizumab showed that the combination was no more effective than either agent alone [33]. In a study of a group of women who received tamoxifen alone versus estrogen plus natalizumab (n = 60), there were no significant differences between these two groups regarding survival after breast cancer diagnosis, invasive procedures or postoperative complications [34]. Similarly, a multicenter study of tamoxifen versus tamoxifen plus natalizumab found a modest decrease in death from breast cancer among women taking tamoxifen and/or natalizumab but no difference when the same women were treated with tamoxifen plus other therapies.

The term ""psychotherapy"" has been used to describe a number of different practices in psychiatry and psychology that have the goal of helping people recover from psychological trauma, depression, anxiety, and other disorders by reducing their negative thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors and focusing on positive beliefs and values. It is an essential element of recovery from psychiatric disorders.

Psychotherapy can help us to:

Learn how to change our thinking about ourselves and others.

Determine when we are ready for therapy (or not).

Increase our ability to accept ourselves as we are.

Decrease our desire to hurt others.

Develop compassion for ourselves, our partners, and others.

Make better decisions and be more self-aware.

How does psychotherapy work?

It starts with asking ourselves questions like these one, two, three…

What am I feeling right now?

Am I experiencing anything close to what you are experiencing?

Am I struggling with anger, fear, guilt, shame, or any feelings related to your life events?

Do my emotions feel justified or unhelpful?

Does my mind often wander and wander away? Do my thoughts go back to things past?

If so, then what do you want me to do about this?

Is there anything I could be doing differently?

These questions allow the therapist to explore the patterns that lead up to your current distress. For example:

Are you spending too much time worrying about other people's opinions of you? Are you constantly blaming yourself for everything that goes wrong in your relationship with them?

Have you been avoiding talking to your partner because it makes you uncomfortable? Have you started seeing someone who seems to get off on hurting you? Are you making excuses for your behavior and blaming yourself for it?

Have you tried to hide your pain by telling yourself that you will never get over it or find a way out? Has your belief system become rigid and fixed?

Has your coping technique failed? If so, what were some of your most common strategies and why did they fail?

Where do I start?

To diagnose CMT, it is recommended that you have your urine tested for creatinine and protein. If the results are positive, you may be diagnosed with a mild form of diabetes mellitus (DM), which typically leads to glucose intolerance, high blood sugar levels or kidney failure.

If you do not find any abnormalities in your tests, then you should be able to determine whether there is an underlying disease or problem causing the abnormal changes in your liver and kidneys.

There are several different types of diabetes. Each type has its own problems and treatments that are suitable for each person's needs. You may want to discuss your options with your doctor and take action based on what works best for you.


Types of Diabetes

Type 1 Diabetes

This is usually caused by either eating too many carbohydrates, not eating enough protein or not exercising enough. People with Type 1 often develop insulin resistance and obesity. They will lose weight slowly but their body fat increases rapidly due to their reduced insulin production. The cause of Type 2 Diabetes is unknown, however scientists believe it to be linked to obesity. It is rare, however, and only occurs in males.

gpt2-large_126,"and the contraceptive effectiveness of intrauterine devices in women at high risk of developing ovarian cancer.

Ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of death among young people worldwide, and is responsible for most deaths from all cancers combined (1). The recent incidence increase has been attributed to factors such as improved screening techniques, use of oral contraceptives, increased access to family planning services, and the introduction of more effective antifertility drugs such as ritonavir and gonalivir which have reduced the risk of recurrence by about half (2–4). A large number of studies suggest that the overall contraceptive efficacy of current oral contraception regimens remains below 95% (5–7), while some estimates put it at 90%–95% (8). Thus, current oral contraceptives are considered to be less safe than conventional methods of birth control, particularly those containing the hormonal progestin dihydrocodeinone or levonorgestrel (9) because they may cause hormonal effects which lead to the development of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and endometrial hyperplasia during early pregnancy.

There is growing interest in using new antifertility drugs for treating patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy or endometriosis who seek treatment for recurrent ovulatory dysfunction after successful surgical removal of an ovary (10). These medications reduce the need for intrauterine instillation of subfractionated testosterone cypionate and ethinyl estradiol, which leads to a reduction in fertility risk (11,12). In this study, we aimed to assess whether intrauterine contraceptive administration reduces the risk of ovarian cancer risk through suppressing gonadal steroidogenesis in postmenopausal women with normal uterine weights (n = 60; mean age 43 years).

The most common side effect of Cefazolin is nausea/vomiting. This happens to more than 90% of patients taking this drug.

How does it work?

Cefazolin works by blocking receptors on cells in your intestines called ""IgA"" receptors. The IgA receptor blocks certain chemicals produced in your body when you eat foods such as gluten or dairy products. When these chemicals are released into your bloodstream, they cause inflammation in your gut and blood vessels.

When you take Cefazolin, these substances go through a series of changes to become less active – they are no longer able to trigger an immune response against the cell walls of bacteria or viruses found in your intestine. These substances get cleared away from your body before they can do any damage.

This process allows many other types of bacteria and viruses inside your intestinal wall to remain healthy and alive.

Do not take this medicine if you have recently been diagnosed with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis; these diseases make up about 70 percent of people who take Cefazolin.

What should I tell my doctor BEFORE taking this medicine?

Before starting any new medication for psoriatic arthritis, discuss it with your healthcare provider. There may be side effects that he or she cannot predict. Also, some medications do not react well with Cefazolin. It is important that your health care team understand which medications you need to avoid. Your healthcare provider will explain how this medicine interacts with other drugs and supplements that your healthcare team prescribes.

The findings in the study were presented today (March 26) at the annual meeting of the American College of Radiology, a leading medical society for the practice and diagnosis of radiation oncology in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Study participants included 19 patients with invasive melanoma who had been treated previously and 14 healthy controls. The patients' tumors were divided into three groups based on the severity of their disease: 1) early stage Stage I and II (no or mild tumor recurrence), 2) late stage Stage III-IV (greater than 30% reduction in size by the time of treatment), and 3) advanced Stage IV-V (total or partial metastasis). In each group, there was an interaction between age and sex to determine whether the cancers developed more rapidly in men. For each group, the rate of progression was calculated by using the Kaplan–Meier method to calculate survival. For each patient, the overall survival was compared to that for the control group.

Patients in the Early Stage I group showed a median survival of 25 months from the initial diagnosis of the first detectable lesion. Patients in the late stage Stage I group also reported a median survival of 27 months. However, in both groups, the rate of progression ranged widely; the rates of progression in patients in the early stage Phase I group were only 5 percent higher than those in the late stage Group II group (P <.001), whereas there was no difference in the rates of progression among patients in the later stages (difference of 11 percent vs. 12 percent, P =.64). A similar pattern was observed in the women who received early stage chemotherapy, as shown by the prevalence of clinically evident nonmelanocytic lymphomas.

""This is the longest and largest prospective study to date investigating the effect of early stage Stage I melanoma on long-term survival,"" said Dr. Joseph C. Neely, M.D., associate professor of radiology and director of the Cancer Epidemiologic Research Program at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. ""It provides significant evidence for these effects.""

According to the researchers, when the incidence of early stage Stage II melanoma is taken into account, the differences between the two groups are smaller, but they remain statistically significant. This suggests that it may be possible to delay disease progression by treating patients with less aggressive therapies.

The answer to this question is a complex one. Here's an overview of ten common chronic diseases which affect millions of people around the world. This list includes conditions like Alzheimer's disease, type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular disease, cancer, asthma and irritable bowel syndrome.

How is it that so many of us live with such devastating health problems? Is there a solution? It may not seem like it at first. But if you look deeper into what causes our condition, the answers begin to become clear.

1) Stress and depression cause many chronic diseases


Stress is one of the biggest contributors to chronic diseases. Whether your job isn't fulfilling, your spouse breaks up with you or something else happens in your life, stress can wreak havoc on your body. We're all familiar with stressful situations, but what about when we experience them ourselves? Stress makes us feel sad and anxious, or lose control over our emotions. There are also signs that you might be experiencing stress. You're stressed out, maybe even hyperventilating. Your heart rate climbs faster than usual, your blood pressure goes up, and your breathing becomes shallow. If you experience any of these symptoms then it seems likely that stress is the reason behind your condition. A study conducted by the Mayo Clinic found that men who were exposed to higher levels of stress were more likely to develop coronary artery disease than those who weren't. The same study concluded that being underpaid was linked to having high cholesterol as well. All in all, stress is responsible for 60% of our illnesses; according to Harvard Medical School, ""stress contributes significantly to 80% of all medical illnesses.""

2) Lack of exercise leads to chronic diseases


As we've already mentioned, stress has its part in making us ill. Exercise can help relieve tension and bring some joy back into your life. But just because it helps you relax doesn't mean you'll enjoy it all the time – especially if you don't know where to start. The problem is that physical activity usually requires effort. So it takes work to make the steps necessary to get moving. As a result, the amount of time spent doing any given activity often takes away from other activities. For example, research shows that 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity equals 50 minutes of sitting! Another issue is lack of motivation. When it comes to exercise, people tend to overestimate their ability to workout. According to studies done by the",1,What are the most common chronic diseases?

""There is always someone in the office who is telling you that they think you're crazy,"" said one person who has worked with people who have MS. ""They can't stop talking about it.""

In his case, he eventually got off anti-depressants after realizing that there was no point in taking them if they didn't make him feel better.

And while the majority of employees with MS find their jobs rewarding enough, it's not easy navigating the system, either. In fact, it may be easier to get into bed without getting up again than it is to make progress on your own.

Most employers understand that it takes time to develop an understanding of people with MS, but they don't expect a person to take responsibility or share it easily. People with MS sometimes feel isolated from family members, coworkers or health care providers; they can feel ashamed of being ill. They also need support from managers, too, because they face some tough decisions every day when dealing with patients, including whether to continue working with the same company.

But even as they grapple with a wide range of issues, many people with MS do maintain some kind of positive relationship with their employer. Some even get hired back.

What is a ketogenic / keto diet ideal for individuals with epilepsy?

Ketogenesis can be used as an aid in treatment of epilepsy. It has been found that when seizures are controlled by ketone bodies, this results in decreased seizure frequency and severity. This is particularly important for those with a history of recurrent seizures or who suffer from generalized tonic-clonic epilepsy (GTCE).

The first step in fixing your posture is to get a proper balance. To find that, stand on one foot with both feet together and hold it there until you feel some pressure between the toes of your right foot and your left foot. Then look down at your left side (just above your shoulder blades) and hold it there as well. The left arm should be under your right side (your chest). Now lean back slightly so that you are looking straight ahead. Now take your head up by bending the knees. Hold this position for about three seconds then release it and lower yourself to the starting point. You can do this in any comfortable position—on your stomach or sitting on the floor, if that's what you prefer. I like standing on my belly with my legs bent to 90 degrees. If you have trouble keeping your right leg from moving in front of your body while standing, try using a chair for support, which will help prevent the movement. This exercise can also be used in conjunction with the first part of the Bilateral Posture Exercise: Stand on either foot, with your heels facing each other, and keep them locked. Keep your shoulders relaxed but not slumped forward; this helps maintain good alignment. For more instructions on how to practice the Bilateral Posture Exercise, see our article on this topic, ""Bilateral Posture."" In addition, there are numerous videos available online showing various ways to improve your posture, including these two:

One thing I've noticed over time is that people who do regular yoga class don't seem to notice much difference in their posture when they stop doing yoga altogether, especially when they're wearing comfortable clothes and sit comfortably in chairs. It seems like there's an automatic assumption that yoga is just about stretching all the muscles of the body, rather than taking into account what we actually need. So it's nice to have a little bit of flexibility in the hips, upper thighs, low back, and neck area to make sure those areas remain in place throughout the day.

When you start going through a series of poses, it may feel like your body is rigid and stiff, because it is! That's normal—it takes some getting used to before it becomes habitual and easier to achieve.

In the most recent study published by the Journal of Clinical Investigation (JCI) in June 2013, the researchers found that low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were higher in women who suffered from an autoimmune disease but had lower HDL cholesterol levels than those with no history of such symptoms. In other words, low LDL cholesterol is a common precursor to a more serious condition called hyperlipidemia. [4]

The Journal of Clinical Investigation article concluded: ""These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that dyslipidaemia plays an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance.""

A number of studies have linked low LDL cholesterol with cardiovascular diseases including heart attacks, strokes and fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). Low HDL cholesterol is also associated with increased risk for coronary artery disease, stroke, and death from all causes, according to one review (see sidebar at right), as well as certain types of cancer.

Low HDL levels have also been linked to high triglycerides, which are deposits of fats that can lead to diabetes and weight gain. A 2011 meta-analysis published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that women with average triglyceride levels have nearly twice the risk of having a heart attack than do women with normal triglycerides. Women with the highest triglyceride levels, however, also have significantly elevated risks of developing type 2 diabetes. These same factors could explain why people with high triglyceride levels have the greatest risk of becoming obese and overweight.

gpt2-large_94,"For many, the answer to this question is still unclear. It is clear that patients with MS who have been diagnosed and treated appropriately often experience significant improvement when they are able to maintain their current treatment regimen for many years after diagnosis, although it can take longer than three or four years to fully recover from a single course of medication. This time frame has led researchers to believe that it takes approximately two to five years before symptoms begin to diminish. The exact timing of initial symptoms may vary between individuals. Because of the ongoing nature of the disease (the ""chronic phase""), there is no simple way to predict whether a patient's symptoms will improve over several years. The best measure of response is how well an individual recovers in each specific area of recovery. Since some people do not respond at all, it is important to recognize that a person may be suffering from an untreated form of MS as long as 5-10 years after diagnosis.

How does multiple sclerosis affect my sex life?

Multiple sclerosis affects men more than women. Women are far less likely than men to develop progressive MS, but even though males tend to live shorter lives than females, these differences are much smaller than among the general population. In fact, males who develop progressive MS die 4.5 times faster than females. Men also have about twice the rate of deaths attributable to other causes, including heart attacks, strokes, cancer, HIV infection, and drug overdose. Research shows that male victims of MS are about twice as likely as female victims to suffer a stroke, compared to similar cases involving both sexes. These numbers do not include those who died during pregnancy, childbirth, or due to suicide. Overall, only 11 percent of MS victims were married, versus 15 percent of non-MS women.

Is there a link between MS and depression?

Research is mixed on this topic. Some studies show that MS may increase the risk of developing depressive disorders such as bipolar disorder or major depression (BD), while others find little evidence that MS increases the risk of developing BDD. A large recent study found a relationship between MS and anxiety and depression, indicating that MS may contribute to the development of these conditions. However, several experts agree that the available research data cannot establish causality. For example, one study showed that a family history of MS was associated with greater risk for anxiety/depression, but another did not. Another study showed that men with a family history of BDD had higher rates of severe depression, whereas women with BDD were not more depressed.",94,When will I start to feel better with multiple sclerosis?,-0.0906509608030319,0,no_prompt,5,0.0,439,23

We had one patient who got it and she was so young, only 16 years old. She didn't know she had eczema because her mother told her what it was for the first time when she was pregnant with her. There are some people who have eczema but they don't know they have it until they get sick or they develop symptoms like rashes. It's a very common condition that can occur in children and adults, including many mothers and fathers.

How long does it take to become diagnosed and treated?

The signs we see usually begin around age five. We start seeing them at birth, so if your baby has an abscess then he will be showing any symptoms by his sixth birthday. If the infection gets bigger than 2 centimeters you should immediately call your doctor. In most cases, within six months you'll get a diagnosis. The rash will appear before anything else changes. After four weeks of antibiotics you may notice improvement, and after two years the amount of eczema will decrease. A good way to tell if you have eczema is to use a skin prick test to check for the presence of blisters on your skin. Some women will find the itching and burning more severe if their breasts are full.

What can I do to fight the itch?

One thing that works well for everyone is to wash your hands often. This goes against tradition and hygiene, especially among younger girls in developing countries, but a lot of parents still think it is something to do only once every few days. You also need to make sure you use antibacterial soap and water or use a mild cleanser to prevent future infections. Many women who have been using these products report having better skin since they've stopped using harsh chemicals. Another easy way to fight the itch is to apply a soothing oil to your face. Oils contain natural oils which will help remove dead skin cells and other irritants from your skin. Also, try using essential oils such as lavender or ylang-ylang (from the Chinese herbal medicine) to ease your skin.

A baby's heart rate can rise to about 105 beats per minute (bpm), which is twice the normal resting level, if it's not adequately monitored during a hospital delivery, research has found.

The risk of premature birth also increases by 10% when a woman or child is admitted with an unstable fetal heartbeat.

Premature births are more than three times as likely for women who smoke and nearly six times as likely for those who have high blood pressure or diabetes, according to the World Health Organisation.

In total, almost 200 million babies are born each year worldwide. Almost 60% die within 24 hours of their birth - an average of 1,100 deaths per day - but that number could climb as much as 20% by 2030 due to increased obesity.

Researchers at Imperial College London looked at data from two large studies: the UK Birth Cohort Study and the EPIC-Oxford study of British adults aged 30 to 64.

They studied 3,832 pregnancies between 2008 and 2011 of women whose health conditions were known and who had given birth within four weeks. They did this because these women tend to be older and have experienced many complications earlier in life.

The team analysed the results of the mothers' medical records for cardiac arrest, haemorrhage or major bleeding - such as placenta previa - to see how they might affect their baby's survival.

Overall, they found that the odds of having a premature birth went up by about a third for every one percent increase in a mother's risk factors: smoking, hypertension, preterm labour, gestational diabetes, and hypertensive disorders. The greatest increase was seen among smokers.

For example, in patients with hypertension, there was a 5.5 fold higher chance of having a premature birth after adjusting for other risk factors, compared with people with no risk factors.

There were no differences between cases where a baby died before or after being delivered, which would be considered a ""normal"" delivery. But, the researchers warn, a ""normal"" birth may still present problems in terms of pain and distress if a baby is born too early.

More information is needed on what types of risks can affect a newborn, and whether they need specific treatment, the authors say.

Study author Dr Andrew Newman said: ""Women who smoke are particularly at risk of delivering prematurely, so we know these individuals should be screened before giving birth.

I'm interested in the notion of mindfulness meditation. You mentioned that some of the most successful results came from research involving mindfulness training. How important is meditation for your practice?

Mindfulness meditation isn't only an activity that involves sitting down and thinking of ways to relax. Most of what we do includes a lot of contemplation, because it changes our emotional state, our mental attitude toward life. Meditation helps us become aware of thoughts and emotions without judgment and without judging them. We start out by taking a few deep breaths, observing our breathing, and making sure that we're using proper technique and breathing correctly. When we're finished meditating, we take another five to ten minutes and then just go about our day without really paying attention to anything else. That makes for a much better night's sleep. I don't believe that meditation will cure depression or anxiety or stress. However, I hope that it can help people stay focused, relaxed and happy while they're meditating, which is very different from having the same brain chemistry that goes along with depression or anxiety and working through those issues. The best advice I can give anyone who wants to use meditation for health reasons is to have a healthy dose of skepticism. Take it slowly. Don't let yourself get too comfortable.

If a person's gender is not clear from the DSM-IV criteria for gender dysphoria or transsexualism, it may be necessary to refer that individual for psychiatric evaluation because of the lack of clarity in this area. Referral should be based on the diagnosis but may also include consideration of the patient's medical history, including whether treatment has been successful with respect to other coexisting conditions (such as mental health problems). If there are additional concerns about potential risks of surgery and/or surgical complications or other issues affecting the quality of life, referral must be made with these considerations in mind. In cases where a person does not meet the criteria for transgender status, a psychologist who specializes in gender identity or gender nonconformity should assess the person. Psychologists can provide information concerning clinical outcomes related to sex reassignment surgery, and they can advise on whether the case qualifies for psychological support or counseling. A therapist who specialises in treating patients with gender dysphoria is recommended for this purpose. This may require some specialized knowledge of the subject matter (e.g., how hormones work) and will usually require an appointment with a psychiatrist, although in practice some therapists have limited experience in working with people whose gender identities do not match their birth sex. It is important to note that transgender individuals need time to prepare for any decision regarding surgery or hormone therapy before it can be considered; many have already undergone hormonal treatments and hormone replacement therapy when referred for evaluation.",114,borderline personality disorder symptoms,-13.015515327453612,106,no_prompt,5,0.9814814814814815,259,0

He added: ""The problem with this particular gene that causes MS is that it has a very high risk of being switched off without treatment.""

In the current study, researchers from King's College London identified a previously unknown mechanism by which inflammation may act as an immune suppressor in patients with MS, contributing to the relapses.

A team led by Dr Josephine Heikkinen, also from King's College London, discovered that in addition to causing inflammatory cytokines (chemokines) within the brain, the process of switching on MS-specific immune cells also triggers cellular changes known to trigger remissions.

This included changes in the way cells behave in response to different molecules released into their surroundings by different immune cell types.

Importantly, these changes were not reversible once the condition had resolved.

Dr Heikkinen said: ""We now know that the effect of inflammation is reversible and that the immune system can effectively use immunity to control MS symptoms.

Medications for ADHD

A number of prescription drugs are available to help treat ADHD symptoms in children and teens. A list of most common treatments can be found in the article: Children's Medication Guide.


Methylphenidate

There is little evidence linking methylphenidate to better academic achievement for children and adolescents who take this drug regularly compared to those who don't. However, if you know your child needs help getting along academically while taking this medication and if he or she shows promise for improving academic performance while taking the medication, then there is nothing wrong with continuing treatment as usual. This medication may also provide a short-term boost in mood and energy levels that helps keep kids off the couch when they feel down or bored. There is no scientific data supporting the use of methylphenidate to improve attention in kids and teens.

Acetaminophen

An aspirin derivative is available over the counter at pharmacies. It has been shown to reduce the risks associated with ADHD medications, including seizures, constipation, and liver failure. Side effects include weight gain and an increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against using acetaminophen for children younger than 12 years old due to its tendency to increase blood pressure and heart rate. If your child takes a daily dose of acetaminophen, then ask him or her about all possible side effects before deciding whether or not to continue treatment. These include headache, nausea, stomach pain, blurred vision, drowsiness, difficulty sleeping, muscle spasms, abdominal pain, and fatigue. Taking a high-dose of acetaminophen for any reason may result in death.

In this case, researchers chose a drug called GSK 139522, which was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It works by blocking a protein, interleukin 5 (IL-5), which promotes immune cell destruction after injury or infection. This leads to more efficient production of white blood cells, which are necessary for proper function of many organs throughout the body including those affected by MS.

The research team used mice with spinal cord injuries to assess how long it took for IL-5 levels to return to normal following surgery. The scientists found that a high dose of GSK 139522 reduced the number of white blood cells returning to normal within five days.

But if you do develop type 2 diabetes it may be a good idea to use a lower-calorie diet than is recommended, because that will reduce your chances of developing complications such as insulin resistance (which can cause the pancreas to produce too much insulin).

There is some evidence that people with obesity who have other medical conditions that increase their risk of heart disease also have an increased risk of developing diabetes. This may reflect that the blood sugar levels of those patients were also elevated at the time of diagnosis. However, there are no data which show whether this is actually the case; therefore we cannot conclude from this study that diabetes itself causes obesity or only obesity increases the risk of developing diabetes.

Treatment for MS:

MS medications are the primary treatment for most people with MS, and their effectiveness is highly dependent on a person's specific level of disease activity.

The majority of people who have MS do not experience any significant side effects from taking these medications, which can be very helpful in many cases when it comes to managing or even reversing some of the symptoms of MS. In fact, many people find that they're able to get off of their medication once the initial period of benefits wears off – but this can also result in serious complications. The bottom line? Taking your medication as directed is usually an effective way to manage or even reverse a lot of the symptoms associated with MS.

In addition to being able to take the medication recommended by your doctor, you should also know about some additional ways you can prevent or delay the onset of the condition. These include reducing stress levels (stress reduction) and eating a healthy diet (eating healthily), getting enough rest (going to bed at the same time each day), having regular physical therapy sessions (physical therapy), and spending quality time with family members (family care). And finally, if you feel more severe symptoms than usual – such as weight gain, joint pain, fatigue, numbness, difficulty thinking clearly, decreased concentration, poor memory, etc. then you may need further medical attention.

It's important to note that MS is a chronic illness. For people whose conditions continue over a long period of time, there will likely be other underlying causes of problems that will require ongoing management. So if you've been suffering from one of the following symptoms for an extended period of time: constant nausea, trouble sleeping, headaches, increased blood sugar, lack of energy, dry mouth, night sweats, and general weakness and tiredness – you probably have MS. This means that if you are experiencing symptoms while on MS drugs, it would be wise to see a healthcare provider right away.

""I think it's very difficult to know what a patient is going to do with this,"" he said. ""There are lots of unknowns.""

In the meantime, researchers have been trying to figure out if there is any evidence that using psilocybin — which has not been shown to benefit MS patients in clinical trials — can help people with advanced forms of the disease and other psychiatric disorders like anxiety or depression.

The study was led by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco that promotes psychedelic research. MAPS' latest report on psilocybin-assisted therapy, which was published in April in JAMA Psychiatry, found that some participants reported improved quality of life in the first three weeks after starting the drug.

But the majority of patients did not see much difference from those who had taken placebo pills for eight days before starting the treatment, while about half of those taking the drug experienced significant improvements, according to the report. The differences were small enough that they could be used as a surrogate marker for safety.

More research needs to be done to determine whether psilocybin, a naturally occurring chemical in the human body, could be effective for treating people with psychiatric illnesses. Some experts say psilocybin may offer some relief to people suffering from PTSD and alcoholism.

Dr. Timothy Grof, director of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Integrative Medicine and one of the researchers behind the study, says more studies need to be conducted to find out exactly how psilocybin works to improve mental health. But he notes that the drugs are already being tested in a handful of clinics across the U.S., and his group plans to move into Phase III clinical trials next year when psilocybin will be available for purchase online, in pharmacies and through physicians' offices.

Some participants took part in those studies because of anecdotal reports from friends, family members and therapists that the treatment helped them overcome their problems, he said. Other participants received training and were paid $20 to take part in the study.

While most people with MS or other psychiatric conditions don't get better with psilocybin, it could be useful for treating other issues such as depression",57,multiple sclerosis stages phases,-10.403471946716309,45,no_prompt,5,0.21739130434782608,413,0
gpt2-large_86,"(PMS) is a chronic, relapsing form of MS. It causes progressive destruction of the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The damage to this membrane leads to electrical problems or even death of nerve cells.

The two most common forms of PMS are diffuse axonal injury (DAAI), which occurs when an extremely fast-spreading lesion starts in a cell's outer layer and spreads outwards through its entire length, and primary progressive multisystem autoimmune encephalomyelitis (PPAMI). PPAMI causes severe symptoms of fatigue, pain, memory loss, speech abnormalities and cognitive dysfunction. Symptoms can be mistaken for those of other types of MS. For example, people with PPAMI may have other signs including headache, sleep disturbances and weight gain. Most commonly, PPAMI affects older adults between 50 and 60 years old and can also affect younger patients.

What Causes Multiple Sclerosis?

Multiple sclerosis is a disorder caused by one or more copies of the disease gene for one or both of two inherited disorders. An individual has one copy of the gene for the inherited disorder and another copy for the immune system disorder known as CD40L. In these individuals, the immune system destroys the healthy cells of the body and causes them to become inflamed and damaged. This happens because the genes are not working correctly. Cells from the immune system mistakenly attack and kill their own tissues. These harmful effects on the body lead to many different symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, confusion, dementia and depression.

What Is Immunosuppression?

A number of immunosuppressive medications are used to treat various diseases and conditions, but some medicines are considered ""interferons."" Interferons work by interfering with your body's normal cellular functions. Examples include aspirin, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide and prednisone. They're commonly prescribed during pregnancy or shortly after birth so that the baby will get adequate nutrients.

Interferon use is strongly discouraged because it interferes with normal bone development, hormone production, growth, and other important processes involved in how the body develops. One study found that women who were treated for osteoporosis had increased risk factors for developing multiple sclerosis and they were six times more likely than women who weren't treated for osteoporosis to develop MS.

gpt2-large_93,"A: Multiple Sclerosis is a very heterogeneous disease. It can affect anyone, regardless of age or sex. Symptoms that are more common among those with MS include fatigue, weakness, and/or numbness in the limbs; pain or discomfort when using one's hands; difficulty swallowing; vision changes that impair vision; and trouble walking, standing, and carrying heavy objects. People with MS may also experience fatigue, sleepiness, memory loss, impaired concentration, problems with thinking skills, and irritability or aggression. In addition, individuals who have MS usually have symptoms similar to those seen by other persons with these conditions including cognitive impairment, headaches, depression, anxiety, and poor concentration. There is no single cure for MS. Treatment consists primarily of lifestyle changes (such as taking daily aspirin), but medications do sometimes work. Some patients may need surgery to relieve symptoms. Sleep disorders such as insomnia and chronic fatigue syndrome are often present in MS patients and cause symptoms similar to those of multiple sclerosis. As many as 50% of all MS cases occur during periods of REM sleep. Researchers don't know why this occurs, but it appears that this period may be related to the immune system malfunctioning and potentially causing damage to the brain or nervous system.

Q: What are some ways I can keep myself healthy while living with multiple sclerosis?

A: First, take regular long-term care of yourself. Take good care of your eyes. Your doctor will prescribe eye glasses for you if needed. Make sure you get enough vitamin D, especially at night, especially in winter months, and drink plenty of fluids so that you stay hydrated. You should avoid smoking. If you're overweight, talk to your doctor about a weight management program. Eat well, exercise regularly, maintain a healthy weight, and make sure to use an eyewash once every two weeks! Finally, make sure you get adequate rest between activities. When you're asleep, your body has a natural healing mechanism called ""sleep debt."" For instance, if you wake up after going on vacation and find yourself feeling tired and dizzy, put your hand over your mouth and try to calm down. Try to relax completely before you go back into action.

What is the best way to treat MS?

Treating MS is complicated because there are many different types of MS. Treatment usually involves improving symptoms — which could include reducing inflammation, limiting disability, controlling pain, and preventing further complications — and helping patients maintain control over their condition through lifestyle adjustments and medicines.",72,Is the Covid-19 vaccine safe for people taking multiple sclerosis drugs?,-0.150369107723236,42,no_prompt,5,0.19718309859154928,149,9
gpt2-large_79,"If you are planning on having another child in the future, it may be difficult to transfer your illness to a new person. It is not unusual for people with MS to have more than one child as a result of their disease. If this happens, there will likely be several complications during pregnancy and childbirth and they must take care of them separately. As an added complication, some women who have MS experience difficulty conceiving. For example, when a woman has active symptoms of MS she can become depressed and feel like her body is rejecting her, so even if the baby does come out fully formed, it could not survive or grow properly. If the mother takes medication that makes it harder for her brain cells to communicate with her muscles, the baby might also suffer from these problems.

I was diagnosed with my first case of MS at the age of 32 years old, now am 55 years old, living in Hawaii. Am I still eligible to get pregnant with another infant due to my MS?

Yes, if you have already had a child through IVF or adoption and were married to the father when your MS diagnosis occurred (usually within 5 years), you may qualify for a second child by way of artificial insemination (AI). An AI procedure involves taking sperm from one individual who has MS and freezing them in liquid nitrogen until a donor can be found. A couple must meet certain criteria (including being married and having been together for 3 months) before applying. Once the egg is fertilized, a surrogate mother is recruited for delivery. The embryo is then implanted into the uterus of the surrogate mother.

It's important to note that the odds of success of a second child born from a first IVF/adoption attempt are extremely low, but this doesn't mean you shouldn't try to conceive again – just be sure to follow up with a fertility specialist before trying to have a second child!

Can I have twins without being diagnosed with MS?

If two siblings are to adopt each other's children, they must both have MS. But if one sibling has MS and the other doesn't, then the twin(s) would have to be adopted individually by the same adoptive parents. Because it is rare that siblings can share genetic material between them, most families choose to have only one biological child and hope that any resulting offspring would carry only half of the disease-related traits. Therefore, there are no guarantees about whether twins will inherit some of the same disease-causing genes from either parent.

For overall survival, the hazard ratio for men with a history of PSA ≤10 ng/mL was 1.01 (95% CI: 0.80–1.32; P =.08); the corresponding hazard ratio for men with a history of PSA ≥ 10 ng/mL was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.57–1.43; P =.40), but both are statistically significant (P <.001). The associations between PSA and prostate cancer mortality were similar for men who had been diagnosed within the first 30 years of follow-up (HR = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.90–1.11) and those in whom PSA was detected at or after age 50 years (HR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.77–1.05; P =.02).

In multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models that included PSA as an exposure variable in which risk factors were adjusted for, there was no evidence that PSA predicted overall survival (hazard ratio: 0.93 [95% CI: 0.88–1.00]; P =.38), compared with not having PSA (HR = 0.87 [95% CI: 0.73–1.09]; P =.62), or prostate cancer death (HR = 0.85 [95% CI: 0.70–1.06; P =.71]).

In addition to the brain-related symptoms that can be caused or exacerbated by these drugs, patients also experience more serious side effects, such as loss of memory and cognitive decline. These conditions may make it difficult for patients with MS to remain in employment, obtain medical insurance, receive disability payments, take medications like steroids, or afford higher living expenses, according to recent research from the University of California at San Francisco. The disorder can leave people unable to perform everyday tasks, such as driving and shopping.

""Most patients who have MS are quite functional and do not need a lot of support,"" says David Fassnacht, a neurologist and professor at UCLA's School of Medicine.

But the drug regimen used in many MS treatment programs—particularly those that use drugs that target the immune system—is highly toxic to the body, researchers say. It is not uncommon for patients who suffer severe gastrointestinal distress to become so ill they cannot even eat, notes Dr. Fassnacht. And patients often don't realize how severely their disease has progressed until the end stages.

Step 2 – Set Up Your Home For A Healthy Breakfast

A healthy breakfast is essential for any successful workout, but it's especially important when you're working out on a treadmill as most people are only able to get a few minutes of exercise before their metabolism slows down and they become tired quickly. Most fitness professionals recommend that everyone at least have an hour of moderate-intensity cardio in the morning; however, many people find that they can do more than five hours of intense cardio during the day if they keep up with daily physical activity goals such as getting up early for school, going for a run every morning, or lifting weights.

Here are some tips from Dr. David Heinemeier Hansson (The American College of Sports Medicine), who has studied the effects of high intensity interval training (HIIT) for decades. HIIT is short bursts of intense work done while sitting with a steady hand for 30 seconds, followed by two brief rests. According to Dr. Hansson, ""I think it works because it improves blood flow to vital organs like the heart. You could also say it helps the brain concentrate."" Many studies have confirmed this, showing that HIIT can help prevent fatigue and improve energy levels throughout the rest of the day. In addition, experts state that HIIT has been shown to be beneficial for improving muscle endurance, preventing weight gain, and maintaining good circulation.

Dr. Hansson suggests that you start your workout by getting into position, making sure the chair is comfortable for both yourself and your partner. Then, simply sit still, keeping your arms straight outstretched. Focus on breathing through your nose, not your mouth, and stay relaxed.

Once you've got yourself positioned properly, you should then begin your workout. Repeat the process until you reach your desired goal. If you want to go longer between intervals, you can gradually decrease the amount of time you spend standing up, which will increase the number of repetitions per set. As long as you're doing as much work as possible, you'll see progress immediately after each session and you'll be able to enjoy your workout even further!

What are some of the main reasons why people fail at weight loss?

Many factors play a role in determining whether or not someone succeeds in losing weight. These include dieting habits, how well they adhere to their weight-loss goals, genetics, hormones and health conditions such as high blood pressure and heart disease. Unfortunately, it's impossible to predict which specific factor will be most responsible for a person's success and failure with the program, because there is no such thing as a ""perfect"" diet. For example, a woman who was able to lose over 100 pounds during her first 6 weeks on a low-carbohydrate diet (with one meal per day) would likely continue her successful weight loss, but she'd probably experience additional issues if she continued this type of diet for long periods. Another great way to understand a person's motivation to lose weight is by looking at what food they eat every single day. While we may find many examples of extreme dietary strategies such as veganism, raw vegans have achieved a significant reduction in both total calories and fat intake while maintaining good health outcomes, and they generally maintain their ideal body weights even when following very strict nutrition guidelines. However, because they consume so few carbohydrates, they may feel fatigued and sluggish after exercising a lot; these symptoms indicate that they're not burning all of their excess energy from physical activity into fat. Similarly, a person who consumes an excessive amount of carbs may also be feeling tired after exercise and may need extra rest days before resuming weight loss efforts, whereas a person who eats fewer than 20 grams of protein per day may suffer from muscle wasting and insulin resistance, indicating poor metabolism. Other common causes of failure are chronic fatigue syndrome, hypothyroidism and other chronic medical conditions. Even those individuals who gain weight on a low-calorie diet often struggle with gaining muscle mass because they don't eat enough protein. This isn't surprising since our bodies cannot efficiently utilize many of the amino acids required to build muscle tissue. Some of the best evidence to date suggests that dieters should aim for between 2 and 5 servings of protein each day and avoid calorie restriction altogether. In addition, it is important to ensure that the dieter has sufficient daily calories and other nutrients provided through regular meals to keep him/her healthy throughout the entire weight-loss process.

gpt2-large_45,"Well, let's face it: We've never heard of a cure for diabetes. But there is hope in the form of a new drug, which has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat type 2 diabetes. It may have an even better chance of success than the current treatment.

The drug, known as acarbose, was developed at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center with support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In addition to treating type 2 diabetes, it could also help many other types of diabetes-related conditions such as metabolic syndrome, kidney disease and high blood pressure.

What does it do?

Acarbose works on the pancreas to improve insulin production. This means that patients with type 2 diabetes need to take less insulin when they eat certain foods or drink certain beverages. Acarbose helps them achieve their goals more easily. For example, patients can still get full meals but are able to take fewer carbohydrates while eating because they don't have so much fat stored up. They also don't suffer from cravings for carbs.

Acarbose has no side effects like those associated with traditional drugs, and it hasn't caused any severe side effects. However, if you're worried about your health, make sure you talk to your doctor first before taking this medication.

Is it safe?

In addition to its safety profile, acarbose is FDA approved to treat diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), a condition where nerves become damaged in the fingers and toes. DPN affects a small percentage of people who are prediabetic, meaning they have higher levels of glucose in their bloodstream.

People with diabetes should avoid getting drunk or having alcohol before starting therapy with acarbose.

Clinical Features

All patients were free from major pregnancy complications at baseline. Patients were randomly assigned to either the extended-cycle pill regimen or the pill regimen for 3 years. After 6 months on the pill regimen, there was no difference between the two groups regarding progression of symptoms; however, women taking the pill reported significantly lower rates of cervical dysplasia (5% vs. 5%, p<0.01) and more frequent and less severe dysmenorrhea (7.6% vs. 7.4%, p<0.05), including both pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and amenorrhoea.

Furthermore, fewer pregnancies occurred among those taking the extended-cycle pill compared with those on the pill for 24 weeks postpartum (22 versus 30, respectively; p = 0.02). Pregnancy incidence was not influenced by adherence to the contraceptive method during the first year following delivery, however; at 24 weeks postpartum, 8.1% of women taking the extended-cycle pill became pregnant whereas 4.2% of women taking the pill were found to be pregnant. For the remainder of the trial, patients who did become pregnant but refused contraception (defined as having no vaginal bleeding within 4 weeks after delivery) were excluded from further analysis. In addition, women who used emergency contraception before the start of their menstrual cycle, including condoms, diaphragms, spermicides, or levonorgestrel intrauterine devices, were also excluded from any followup data collection because they would have been expected to use contraception once they started the next menstrual period.

The study included women who had been diagnosed with early or late stage breast cancer within the past five years and were undergoing hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of metastases into the liver, other non-cancerous sites or other organs after at least one year. Secondary outcomes included pregnancy and postpartum complications. All patients took part in this research project under guidelines developed by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and Clinical Trials Service UK (CTSUK), which are approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University College London Medical School. Women receiving HRT were given an oral contraceptive pill every day during the first four months of their treatment period, as well as the hormone patch or gel. Women taking progestogen only drugs that have been shown to be safe and effective in treating male pattern hair growth were also excluded from participation. During the course of the trial, all participants underwent regular follow up examinations. They provided written informed consent when they signed up.

A total of 1,859 new cases of breast cancer were identified through screening, diagnosis and biopsy. Of these, 890 women completed the final examination over a median of 5 years. There were no significant differences between those who completed the full assessment versus those who did not receive any information on breast health at baseline. However, there were some small changes in women who completed the last assessment compared with those who did not complete the study (p=0.051). Of those who completed the assessment, approximately 75% reported having breast pain, 50% said they believed they had the right amount of time until it became clear whether they would need surgery and 22% reported experiencing discomfort because of symptoms. No significant differences in response rates (number needed to treat) were found between those whose assessment was incomplete or who did not complete the full assessment compared with those who completed the assessments before completing the full questionnaire.

In comparison with women who did not experience breast pain, those reporting a feeling of discomfort were more likely to report either pain relief or increased use of contraception. Those who experienced breast pain were significantly less likely to use hormonal birth control, including both the patch or gel, than women who did not experience breast pain (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.98).

gpt2-large_77,"MS is a chronic inflammatory disease, meaning it affects the brain and nervous system. In many cases of MS, symptoms are similar to those of other autoimmune diseases, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. They can include fatigue, memory loss, headaches and muscle weakness. Many people with MS also have difficulty swallowing due to inflammation in their esophagus. This may cause them to choke on food or drink, especially if they don't eat regularly. Symptoms vary from person to person depending on how active they are. Some people report MS-like symptoms only during certain periods of time. For instance, some women experience symptoms only while menstruating. Others experience severe pain during pregnancy.

What causes Multiple Sclerosis (MS)?

Researchers believe that this inflammatory condition arose because the immune system began attacking healthy cells. The immune system attacks healthy cells by causing damage to these cells' DNA, which then leads to an uncontrolled growth of abnormal lymphocytes, or white blood cells. The body's response to attack this damaged cell population results in MS. People who are infected with bacteria in their digestive systems may be more susceptible than others. Bacterial infections that can lead to MS include Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Infection through eating contaminated food is another risk factor for developing MS. A common source of infection is a diet high in meat and dairy products. This can result in the formation of plaque in your gut called gut ulcer disease. Gouty arthritis is also a risk factor.

I've seen it happen in so many different situations, I think it's pretty clear that there are some very specific criteria to meet if someone wants to be diagnosed as diabetic.


This question has been asked many times on this board. However, most of the time, the answer isn't really that clear-cut - more like, yes. If you're currently doing well with insulin therapy (see below) then you have high levels of glucose and will likely respond well to a low carb diet. On the other hand, most folks who experience low blood sugar in response to a carbohydrate restricted diet won't be able to tolerate this type of diet indefinitely, especially if they're taking insulin at some point during the week. It doesn't help much to just say, ""It works for me!"" You should do everything possible to get healthy, stay healthy, eat healthy and maintain your weight. So long as you're eating the right foods and exercising regularly, it should be fine. But again, those things aren't always going to be easy to manage. There are numerous ways to manage your blood sugar while following a fat free diet. A lot depends on how much carbohydrates you're eating; carbs alone may not be enough to make up for all the extra sugars present in a non-ketogenic diet (a large portion of a high carb diet). Also, whether you're losing weight or gaining weight depends on your level of physical activity, etc.


If you want to be sure that you're getting a good response from the ketosis you're trying to achieve, I would recommend reading about Ketones and Blood Glucose by Dr. James H. Krieger. This is one of the books which helped kickstart my interest in understanding ketone bodies. In short, ketones are the body's way of capturing glucose when we exercise (by burning calories in our muscles), and keeping glucose in the bloodstream longer after we stop exercising (by burning them off through fat metabolism). They also serve as a natural source of fuel for both the brain and gut during fasting. As such, they allow us to take in less food than we expend over a 24 hour period of fasting, allowing us to effectively lose weight and gain muscle throughout",35,Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?,-4.646363258361816,25,no_prompt,6,0.16129032258064516,425,19

gpt2-large_94,"For all of us who have MS, the answer is not ""soon."" However, if you are already in remission from MS (no new lesions or relapses), the chances are good that your symptoms should improve. In fact, this is usually true even after several years of treatment.

MS has a range of different symptoms and can appear as either chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) or recurrent systemic sclerosis (RS). Many people with MS experience both CIDP and RS, but it's more common for those diagnosed with CIDP to also develop RS. This may be because people with CIDP tend to do poorly on medication so they need periodic treatments for their disease to keep them well. Those patients who have experienced one course of therapy for at least six months with no recurrences report the worst symptoms of any group of patients - including fatigue, insomnia and poor concentration - when their MS progresses.

In contrast, some people with RRMS develop a milder form of MS called rheumatoid arthritis - rhabdomyolysis (RMD) or rhabdochocytic anemia (RDA). RMD tends to run its course relatively quickly, often within a few months or less, and has significantly worse effects than CIDP or RS. RMD can include weakness and numbness in the feet, knees, arms and hands; blurred vision and muscle spasms, and in rare cases, paralysis. The most commonly reported side-effects are a variety of skin rashes, which usually resolve when the body begins rebuilding itself. Some patients with RMD may need steroids to control the inflammation. For those with CIDP or RS, there is generally no long term benefit from steroid injections; these injections only help to stabilize the condition and prevent further deterioration. So if you're one of the 1% who develops rheumatoid arthritis, ask yourself whether you want to risk having a relapse. If not, then we recommend waiting a little while longer before starting a new round of immunosuppressive medications like prednisone and cyclophosphamide.

What else does MS do to my body?

The immune system plays a role in many diseases, and MS is just another of them.

If a woman is told by an abortion provider that she has a ""pre-cancerous"" tumor in her ovary which will kill her if removed or at least have her life shortened dramatically (and there are many) then she is not likely to try for an abortion unless there is a serious risk of death. The abortion clinic staff knows this, because they have seen it happen so often before. They know that the chances of getting cancer after the removal of an unwanted pregnancy are much greater than having the baby. And most of those doctors and nurses working in these clinics are well trained and experienced enough to know when to tell the truth when asked, but they don't want to hurt the patient's feelings by telling them what they really believe. It does NOT mean that abortions should be denied for any reason or women must endure pain.

Even without the lies of Planned Parenthood and its partners we could see why people would think otherwise. The world is full of misinformation. But when you watch these videos, it becomes clear why people would feel like lying was acceptable and normal.

When I first found out about Planned Parenthood, I thought I had found the real reason women get abortions. I'd read about their existence, heard that they do amazing work, but had never met one of them. One time while I was waiting for an appointment with my gynecologist, he mentioned how I might be able to save money on insurance and not pay for the procedure myself. I felt bad that he didn't know more, but I knew it wasn't true. He laughed and said that maybe I wouldn't mind paying for his services, since he was already doing it anyway.

I went to Planned Parenthood two days later and was put through a bunch of tests. I got pregnant again. When I asked him if I could afford the cost of the procedure himself, he replied ""Well, I guess I'll have to cover that."" And if he had wanted me to pay for the abortion, he would have, I suspect. His job was to help make sure women were healthy enough to carry and raise children, not just that they die of ovarian cancer at the age of 20.

gpt2-large_54,"Multiple Sclerosis is a condition where your body produces more of the nerve cells called myelin sheaths in your brain. These fibers are used to transmit signals between nerves, but they can be damaged or destroyed if there's an infection or injury. It's also associated with symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. People with MS don't have all these problems, so what causes them varies from person to person, according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). But the exact cause of MS remains unknown. In fact, researchers still aren't sure why it happens. A new study published today in the New England Journal of Medicine offers some clues that may help explain how MS occurs. The research team analyzed MRI scans of 946 people who had MS at one point in their lives. They looked for abnormalities in certain areas of the brain known to play a role in MS, including the orbitofrontal cortex, a region linked to decision-making, impulse control and risk-taking behavior. Researchers found that when the patients were younger than 40 years old, about half of the people with MS had lesions in this area, suggesting that it could have been responsible for making them ill. ""Our results suggest that having multiple sclerosis is very much like having other autoimmune diseases,"" says lead researcher John B. Graham Jr., MD, PhD, an assistant professor of neurology at the University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine. ""The disease itself can cause damage in specific regions, but the different immune systems involved in those diseases contribute to the overall disorder."" Although the findings show how multiple sclerosis might occur, they're not definitive yet. For instance, scientists must first determine whether the same pattern of abnormal MRI scanning patterns seen on people with MS leads to disease activity in the rest of their bodies, too. ""We will need better tests to see if the brain is functioning normally again after having multiple sclerosis,"" says Graham. Still, the findings offer important clues to understanding how the disease affects our brains and bodies. For example, it should help doctors develop treatments that are able to reduce inflammation and restore healthy function in people with MS. ""This is really exciting because we've identified some of the mechanisms by which the inflammatory process contributes to MS, and now we know exactly how it happens in the brain,"" says Dr. Jeffery C.

We know that inflammation is one major risk factor for autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and lupus. However, it should not be confused with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The two conditions often go hand in hand since they both involve problems with our immune systems.

In addition, you may think you have a good immune system but you don't really because you aren't getting enough food. One way to improve your immune function and reduce infection is by getting adequate vitamin D3 from sun exposure. Vitamin D has been shown to help protect against infections. To learn more about optimal sun exposure and vitamin D, check out our article on sunlight: 10 facts you need to know. In fact, eating foods rich in calcium can make you less susceptible to CFS symptoms.

In addition to these conditions, thyroid disorders can also be caused by other factors such as an overactive pituitary gland, a condition called hypothalamic-pituitary axis imbalance (hypothyroidism), and even metabolic diseases like obesity or diabetes.

What Causes Thyroid Disease?

The cause of many autoimmune disorders is unknown, but the underlying mechanisms for some may include:

Genes that control your body's immune system

Excessive production of hormones from excess fat cells

Poor cellular health in your heart and liver

A change in your diet that leads to overproduction of toxins

Overreliance on certain foods and supplements that do not work as well as they might

You should see your doctor if you have any questions about your current eating habits or if you think you might have thyroid disease. Your doctor will use your medical history and symptoms to figure out what type of treatment is best for you.

Treatment Options for Thyroid Diseases

Your doctor may choose one or more treatments depending upon the severity and duration of your illness. For example, certain medications will prevent side effects while others may temporarily reduce inflammation, thereby reducing symptoms or improving quality of life.

Anabolic Steroids — A number of different steroids (testosterone boosters) are used to treat and suppress unwanted hormone levels. There are several different types of testosterone boosters available; however, all of them have negative side effects if taken too long term (i.e., at least six months). To avoid this problem, your doctor will prescribe a low dose of high potency testosterone and begin gradually increasing it until you're satisfied with its effectiveness. In the meantime, follow your doctor's recommendations when taking anabolic steroids. However, only take a very small amount, and don't take higher doses than recommended.


Growth Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) — Growth hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases the length and thickness of your bones and regulates their growth. Although it has been proven effective in treating osteoporosis, there are risks involved in using HRT regularly, especially if you develop side effects like weight gain or mood changes. You'll need regular blood tests in order to monitor your progress, so make sure to ask your doctor about the options available to you.

And about a quarter of those people live in nursing homes or assisted living facilities. What can you do for them when they're out there? The most common way is to give them wheelchairs, but it's not always possible. For example, some people might be unable to get a wheelchair, even if they've been treated for their disease before. When that happens, you might need to make special arrangements in your home. Other people who are severely disabled may also require an elevator and ramps, which may take time and money. If you suspect someone needs assistance walking long distances because of MS, consider whether you should help with the transport, or hire a personal care assistant (PBA) to assist.

How does my family cope with medical expenses related to MS?

Health insurance premiums are often high. Many parents worry whether they'll qualify for financial aid from state or federal government programs. Depending on income levels, many families may also face tax consequences associated with their own health plans, including deductibles and co-pays. Some health plan providers will not accept Medicare payments. As a result, many doctors refuse to treat MS patients, resulting in significant delays. These issues become even more challenging for people with disability who depend on others to provide a large portion of their finances. Often times, these individuals are responsible for paying for food, lodging, transportation, and other daily necessities. Although many people with MS will try to find jobs, these efforts can be difficult due to lack of available work opportunities and the challenges employers encounter. A few employees may choose to look into their options outside of the workplace. However, finding employment is a complex process for workers with MS. Employers must assess workers' eligibility for benefits based on various factors, including age and prior work experience. To better understand this process, employers may wish to contact a career coach in order to learn how to successfully recruit workers with MS. They could ask about their current salary expectations and determine if they would like to begin at the lowest level, or lower, without having to raise wages over time.

gpt2-large_22,"(T2DM) has been increasing in recent years. The findings of the study, published today (April 12) in Diabetologia, suggest that it is important to recognize and address these factors when considering lifestyle interventions to reduce T2DM risk.

The researchers analyzed data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort and found that men with a BMI <25 and women with a BMI >30 were at greater risk for getting type 2 diabetes than those who did not meet these criteria. Men and women with high blood pressure also had an increased likelihood of being diagnosed with T2DM. However, the greatest increases in risk occurred in individuals aged 40-49 years old, which represents the majority of all participants. Those taking statins for cardiovascular disease or noncommunicable diseases appeared to be able to lower their overall risk of developing type 2 diabetes by about 25 percent.

""Our results suggest that statin therapy can help maintain healthy weight and reduce our risk for type 2 diabetes,"" said lead author Dr. Manish Sisodiya, Professor of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Cambridge and Director of EPIC. ""By controlling blood glucose levels at a young age, we may be able to prevent many of the risks associated with obesity.""

Previous studies have suggested that people who are obese should follow a low-fat diet. However, other studies have failed to show this effect and instead indicated that individuals eating a typical Western diet are more likely to develop T2DM than lean individuals. A number of new anti-obesity medications are now available to treat some types of T2DM. Although they have shown to be effective in reducing cholesterol levels, most do little to lower blood sugar. To date, only one medication known as metformin, a type 2 diabetes drug originally developed for patients with Type 1 diabetes, has been approved for use in adults over 35 years of age. Metformin is commonly used in combination with a multivitamin and mineral supplement. As well, there are currently no drugs on the market specifically designed to treat type 2 diabetes. Additionally, few studies have investigated whether a Mediterranean diet is beneficial against the development of T2DM. This was a major focus of the current study.

For the current study, researchers enrolled 19,955 individuals between the ages of 20 and 69 years old from a population based sample, including 10,071 men and 7,716 women.

There are a number of studies that have shown that when patients with MS take TNF inhibitors, they experience better treatment response and fewer relapses. In fact, some research suggests that when these drugs were prescribed to children with childhood-onset MS, there was an improvement in their MS symptoms. This is not surprising, as it has been found that drugs like LPS can improve the immune system function (see also: ""Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Can Enhance Myelin Repair""). However, one study showed that although most people who took a combination of TNF inhibitors and low-dose aspirin experienced improved treatment outcomes, those on high-dose TNF inhibitor did not appear to have an improved outcome. A large number of trials have failed to show any significant benefit from using either TNF inhibitor or anti-inflammasome medications together, even for people with mild forms of MS. There are two reasons why this may be happening; the first being the amount of drug taken by many of these patients. Many people taking TNF inhibitors do not need them, whereas for others they require them to prevent relapses. And, as we've seen above, taking TNF inhibitors alone does nothing more than protect against relapse. So how is that possible? The second reason is because both the drug and the medication come from proteins produced by the body and so must interact with each other to produce their effect. But, what if you don't know which protein is responsible for producing the drug or drug's metabolite? That's where our knowledge about the molecule known as GDF11 comes into play. We know the exact structure of GDF11, but it's very difficult to read, particularly when it comes to molecules containing a few letters (such as GDF11). It turns out that a different family of molecules called S100B have been discovered that contain sequences similar to GDF11 but also possess a unique property – they're able to bind tightly to certain proteins in order to block the activity of those proteins. These molecules are called ligands. Most commonly, ligands are used by cell cultures to form membranes, including those that help support cells' growth. For instance, researchers at MIT believe that GDF11 might be involved in the production of new blood vessels, and in order to achieve this, they injected the same gene sequence into mouse embryos during development. In order to see whether this happened, the team created mice with different versions of the gene in a dish.

MS patients have been found to be at greater risk for the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease than their unaffected siblings. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether or not the severity of symptoms observed in children with PMS increased with increasing age during adolescence. In addition, we hypothesized that there would be differences between the overall prevalence of symptoms occurring in different ages.

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study using data from the Medical Outcomes Study 23 years after baseline on the age-specific prevalence of the most common types of neurological disorders among children diagnosed with PMS and compared these results with those obtained from the National Health Interview Survey conducted in 1988–1994. A total of 2228 adolescents were included.

RESULTS: There were no significant differences across time periods in the incidence of any of the most prevalent neurologic disorders in boys compared to girls (odds ratios [OR] 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98–1.16). For women, the OR for major depressive disorder was significantly lower in the late adolescent period (6.8 [95% CI, 5.0–7.2]) relative to later puberty and early adulthood (10.5 [95% CI, 9.0–11.3]). Similarly, there were no statistically significant trends in the incidence of any other neurological disorders in either group over time.

gpt2-large_93,"It's not known whether sleep disturbances are a risk factor for MS or if it is simply due to a person being less active than normal. However, one study suggested that the association between MS and sleep deprivation was stronger in patients with relapsing-remitting MS who were reported as having a greater number of sleep difficulties (8). In another study, it was found that people with MS who had poor sleep habits tended to have more severe symptoms (9) and that many of those who slept poorly reported their symptoms affected them day after day (10). As well, it was observed that those who had poor sleep also tended to be younger and more physically inactive and therefore also at increased risk for disease progression (11). This suggests that MS may affect sleep patterns and may increase the risk for relapse and recurrence of MS (12).

In an attempt to better understand the relationship between MS and insomnia, researchers studied sleep patterns and health status among elderly persons with relapsing-remitting MS. The investigators assessed sleep quality using two questionnaires: the Sleep Quality Index (SQI), which measures how much time each night you spend asleep per week, and the Insomnia Severity Scale, which assesses severity of insomnia by asking about your tendency to become overly restless when awake during the night (13). They measured health status by evaluating all three scales together in order to determine whether people's physical health suffered from worsening over time (14–16). At the beginning of the study, all subjects took part in a questionnaire assessing their sleep quality. Subjects completed this questionnaire twice a year throughout their life course (17).

All participants received a standardized medical examination every 6 months to collect data on their general health condition, medical history including medication use and other treatments, psychosocial factors such as depression and anxiety disorders and social functioning and disability. After these examinations, the authors determined whether they met criteria for MS using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), an established and widely used instrument for assessment of overall health status (18). This test evaluates symptoms associated with MS according to a standard set of questions based on a validated scale (19) with 16 categories ranging from ""no"" to ""extremely high.""

However, in some cases this can cause damage to nerves and blood vessels that leads to problems with balance, vision or coordination, as well as symptoms such as fatigue and joint pain. A large number of these side effects do not occur when corticosteroids are taken on an empty stomach but instead result from the body's production of cortisol – a hormone that controls metabolism. Cortisol levels increase during periods of high activity, so if you take cortisone in your diet, you may be more likely to develop such side effects than those who have not been taking it. Many people also experience severe diarrhea and vomiting. In general, there is no evidence that corticosteroids increase the risk of serious adverse events, although they should still be used carefully.

Answer: Yes, you may be able to continue your pregnancy even after treatment for MS has stopped or has been discontinued. While this may not happen in all cases, there are some situations where a pregnant woman would benefit from taking medication when she cannot otherwise take care of herself. For example, patients who have taken medication for several years and are now receiving an appropriate new dose will usually want to stay on their medication even while they are pregnant. If this is true, then it might be possible to do so before giving birth. This is also true if the mother already takes prescription medications that could interfere with her ability to keep up her normal weight and activity levels during pregnancy. Also, doctors sometimes treat women with multiple sclerosis by prescribing them corticosteroids, which suppress inflammation in the brain and spinal cord. These drugs should be avoided because they may impair fetal development, which makes future pregnancies more likely.

The authors believe these findings will be useful in assessing the potential risks associated with the use of marijuana and other psychoactive drugs, especially given the growing number of Americans diagnosed with MS.

The researchers studied data from nearly 100,000 participants (about 13 percent of the U.S. population aged 18 or older) drawn from the National Health Interview Survey from 1997 through 2006. They were then matched on age and gender by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Overall, they found that individuals with MS had more than twice the risk of developing multiple sclerosis as did non-MS patients. Additionally, people with MS had a greater likelihood of having symptoms of the disease compared to those without the condition.

A lot of people do not feel good when they sit like that, but we are not talking about sitting down on a chair – we have to make sure there will not be any problems like ""stiffness"" or ""soreness"". This means using the correct muscles. The muscles in our legs are what hold us up during sitting at work. We don't want them to be stiff and sore just because someone wants to change their posture.

We can stretch out the leg muscles by contracting the hamstrings and glutes. It may seem like it's hard to do, but it really doesn't take more than 20 seconds to achieve a great stretch. Try it! Your body needs time to adjust after an intense workout. If you are able to get that 20-30 second stretch, then you know you can move forward and actually start stretching your leg muscles.

This exercise strengthens the abs while also strengthening the triceps, bicep, forearm and shoulders. You only use one hand at first, but it helps build strength and stability in all four extremities.

You'll notice how it's made up of two movements:

1) Lower yourself into the starting position, then press back up until you are parallel to the floor.

2) Repeat on the opposite side.

Make sure you keep your spine neutral throughout. Do not let your lower back bend excessively. When you do lower yourself down, do so slowly and without pushing yourself too far backwards. Keep your back flat against the wall and maintain a straight line from your hips towards your knees (see photo).

Once again, try it! Let your body adjust once again, and see if it works for you. I believe this technique can improve your core and body coordination.

However, this effect did not reach statistical significance after adjustment for baseline risk factors (such as smoking status or BMI), and it occurred only among patients treated at an earlier stage when there was a better prognosis.

A meta-analysis of trials on nivolumab compared it to placebo (31), which concluded that nivolumab had no significant clinical benefit over placebo. However, the authors noted that ""the results of the combined analysis were consistent with previous studies on the use of rituximab [rifampin] alone"" (17). The current study found a similar result: A higher dose of rituximab (3.4 mg/m2) was associated with more favorable outcomes against metastases than nivolumab (6.7% vs. 3.9%).

Taken together, these data suggest that even though there are important differences between the nivolumab and placebo arms in terms of their endpoints and progression rates, they do provide evidence that high doses of nivolumab may have a beneficial impact on long-term survival in patients with metastatic lung or breast cancer. In addition, although further research is needed in order to clarify whether different dosing patterns are necessary, in our view, this trial offers strong support for an approach based on the combination of high doses of both drugs.",117,stage 4 metastatic lung cancer outcome,-5.941843509674072,35,no_prompt,6,0.14112903225806453,263,4

The risk for serious adverse events is increased in patients taking temozolomide who have had prior cancer treatment. The most frequent cause of death from this disease is thrombosis or an embolic event (e.g., stroke). Patients on high doses may be at higher risk of bleeding and severe nausea due to the use of low-dose aspirin or acetaminophen. Although temozolomide has not been associated with any significant toxicity, it should always be used with caution when giving blood products that contain potassium iodide because these drugs can interact with temozolomide.

Temozolomide is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a first-line treatment for acute myeloid leukemias.

gpt2-large_53,"The following are the main characteristics of psychotherapy:

(1) it involves an understanding and appreciation of one's own feelings, thoughts, attitudes, values, and beliefs. (2) it seeks to correct or change the underlying cause of one's problems by changing behavior. It may take a number of approaches including learning and practice of techniques such as mindfulness meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), hypnosis, etc. (3) it promotes self-healing and rebuilding of relationships; however, it does not address personality disorders or any other mental illness (4) it focuses on the treatment process rather than merely symptoms or pathology. In fact, many people who have been treated with psychotherapy find that they no longer see themselves as having a problem at all. Rather, their symptoms seem less severe because they recognize how far along they've come in their recovery from the original source of distress.

Psychotherapy is very effective for dealing with certain types of emotional problems but it generally cannot be used alone nor can it do much good if combined with other therapies or medications.

In addition, although there are some things about psychotherapies which are not necessarily bad, they also fall into two broad categories. First, psychotherapy often involves a lot of personalization of your problem—the therapist asks questions, makes suggestions, and tries to understand you better through the lens of your particular circumstances. Second, most forms of psychotherapy involve repetitive techniques of talking, listening, moving, and feeling (sometimes called ""therapeutic suggestion""). For example, in psychoanalysis, the patient is given a series of questions to answer before being asked to do anything else, so that the therapist can try to identify the real causes of his or her behavior. However, this sort of technique tends to be highly individualized in its application. Although most therapists are trained to apply only one type of therapeutic suggestion, others will sometimes use multiple kinds of techniques simultaneously, such as trying to focus the mind on specific objects while still allowing the body to move. Also, therapists may have special training in working with patients with schizophrenia (which includes delusions and hallucinations), borderline personality disorder (involving an inability to distinguish between true and false memories), and other complex psychological disorders (such as depression). When these and other areas of expertise are involved, the effectiveness of psychotherapy declines considerably.

gpt2-large_45,"If you're going to have a baby, make sure you check your blood sugar levels before and after the procedure. If it's too high, you can end up with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is an extremely serious medical emergency that can lead to death within minutes of getting out of bed or eating dinner. It can also cause other complications, such as kidney failure or kidney damage.

The best way to avoid DKA is to stay on insulin. Insulin works by making certain blood sugars less concentrated—you should only need about one unit per hour for women of childbearing age. This will help keep your body from overproducing insulin when you don't need it. And because it makes your glucose level lower, it means your body doesn't produce as much ketone bodies—the fats inside your cells that are burned during exercise. A low carb diet has been shown to protect against DKA, so long as you keep your carbohydrates down to around 40% to 60%.

But if you go off insulin completely, there's no way to know whether you'll develop DKA or not until the problem happens. You may even start having symptoms right away. So doctors recommend doing a full physical exam at least three days after you stop taking insulin—but that's not always possible, since some people get symptoms during their routine physical exams. If it does happen, it's critical that you see your doctor immediately.

Treating Diabetes

After you've found a good doctor who's willing to treat your diabetes, you might want to try another method of treating it—for example, dietary changes, medications, lifestyle changes, nutritional supplements, or weight loss. For this reason, it's important to read all the labels thoroughly before trying any new treatment plan. Some people who follow low-carb diets are able to maintain healthy weight without them, but others can lose a lot of excess pounds—and they often do it without changing the foods they eat.

For some patients with type 2 diabetes, medication is sometimes necessary to control the disease. But medications used for Type 1 diabetes can cause side effects like dry mouth, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain, irritability, and sleep disturbances. They can also interact poorly with each other, leading to unwanted side effects.

And while some treatments can prevent or slow the progression of diabetes, other therapies won't work well for everyone. Your doctor should be able to tell you what's effective in your case. He or she can",45,Can diabetes be cured?,-3.988164186477661,49,no_prompt,6,0.3888888888888889,410,11

The effectiveness decreases over time with increased age, but there has been no study showing any decrease in the use of oral contraceptives among older women. In all likelihood, this is due to different degrees of response and/or the development of adverse events. For example, the incidence of allergic reactions in women under 50 years old is very low. It is noteworthy that only one reported case of a woman under 25 having anaphylaxis was related to oral contraceptive use. However, it should be noted that these cases were unrelated to the contraceptive itself and could have occurred in other sources besides oral contraceptives.

Precautions

Avoid contact with eyes, mouth and other mucous membranes (especially those around the eyes), especially during pregnancy. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, use only a product that is formulated for your specific needs. Do not share products used to treat allergies with others. Keep all products out of reach of children. To prevent cross-contamination from using these products, do not store them near food or utensils (e.g., dishwashers).

gpt2-large_77,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects the brain, spinal cord, and muscles. It's characterized by progressive changes in the immune system, which can cause inflammation, autoimmune diseases, nerve damage and other serious problems. In most people with MS, there are two types of attacks: the primary attack and secondary attacks. Primary attacks often have no visible signs or symptoms, but they are very painful. Secondary attacks usually cause a decline in overall function and in some cases, blindness. People who have the first type of attack may still feel pain from it, and they'll likely continue to get more severe attacks over time. Both types of attacks need medical treatment as needed, but the severity of the attacks depends on how bad they're getting. The number of different types of attacks varies between people with MS and those without it. One way to describe them is as follows: Primary attacks

Primary attacks involve only one type of attack at a time. They occur when the body's own immune system, specifically T-cells, goes after the same cells as a disease like MS has been causing them. Because T-cells are part of the cell's normal response to infection, these ""normal"" T-cells destroy the damaged tissue and reabsorb the disease-causing cells. This process normally happens within 24 hours and is called autoreactive T-cell mediated immunosuppression (ARTI). But during an acute attack, this autoimmune response can go for months or even years before the body has time to repair itself. A person with MS gets their first primary attack about five years into the disease. Then, every 10 years, they get another one. Every 10 years, their risk of having a second attack doubles. For someone who had a first attack during age 40, this means that he will be 50 years old in 2020 — four years earlier than expected. With each successive primary attack, the risk increases further. Since most people with MS start experiencing symptoms starting around age 20, they tend to live longer than expected. Many people experience several primary attacks per year.

Secondary attacks

A second type of attack occurs when T-cells try to find and destroy newly formed new white blood cells called macrophages, which are specialized cells that help kill off dangerous invading bacteria. These macrophage attacks typically happen about every three months during what scientists call the ""perihelional phase."" When this happens, patients have many fewer new white blood cells than usual and the immune system doesn't know",77,How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?,-6.083829879760742,101,no_prompt,7,0.41735537190082644,414,10

Hemp oil is also used as an antiseptic agent, moisturizer, mouthwash, insect repellent, eye drops, and a skin irritant. It has been widely researched for its use in treating oral cancers such as breast cancer and prostate cancer. However, there are no specific studies on this drug yet but it may be effective in reducing the risk of these cancers developing through inhalation and ingestion.

A study conducted by the University of California at San Diego found that hemp oil can reduce levels of dioxins in human blood. The findings came after researchers tested the effects of consuming 2 ounces of raw or cooked hemp seed oil on human blood samples taken from four healthy adults. When they compared levels of dioxins in their blood with those measured before and after consumption, they discovered that the amount of dioxins dropped to just under one-tenth of what it was in the control group's blood. Although this is only preliminary research, this suggests that this plant could have significant health benefits.

In addition to helping you to feel better, hemp has many medicinal properties. These include anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating, analgesic, anticancer, vasoconstricting, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties. One study showed that a strain of cannabis called THC-CBD exhibited fewer adverse side effects than other strains of marijuana when administered orally, suggesting that CBD may be more beneficial than THC in relieving symptoms of certain conditions.

Eating enough hemp provides your body with essential amino acids which play vital roles in regulating hormone production as well as metabolism. They can help prevent your pancreas from storing fat which leads to fatty liver disease, high cholesterol, and type II diabetes. Studies show that hemp contains essential fatty acid (EFAs) that can protect your heart and increase energy levels when consumed by your body. A recent study shows that omega 3 fatty acids in hemp foods are linked to lower blood pressure, less inflammation, improved insulin sensitivity, and reduced obesity rates among overweight/obese individuals.

""If you're a health care professional, you should be aware that this study is not intended to endorse or discourage the use of exercise,"" says lead author Dr. Andrew Weil, director of the Obesity Center at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. ""But the findings are interesting because they show that a small amount of exercise can help reduce BMI and diabetes risk.""

One key finding: Compared with non-exercisers, those who were able to increase their moderate-intensity daily walking by 20 minutes per day saw significant reductions in weight gain during follow-up. In addition, there was no difference between those who followed up for four years (and completed all the steps) versus those who did not.

Those taking part in regular walks also had lower levels of LDL cholesterol than those who weren't physically active, but only if they took part for two hours a week—a level far below what would be considered an ideal walk schedule.

Weil notes that his group found no effect on body fat percentage among participants either way, suggesting that walking may simply provide some additional energy for the body while simultaneously decreasing inflammation and appetite, which both contribute to obesity and heart disease. And while previous research has shown that reducing activity levels in obese individuals lowers blood pressure, he cautions that other factors such as depression or anxiety also play a role.

And although several studies have suggested exercise may have effects on overall health, few have looked at long-term outcomes, and the present results suggest the importance of more rigorous trials in future.

""We need to do a better job looking at this question,"" says Weil, adding that most clinical trials examining the health have focused primarily on short-term measures such as walking distance.

In addition, we cannot fully explain why exercising could decrease weight if it does so through other mechanisms, such as increased metabolism, hormone levels, insulin sensitivity or brain function.

""There are lots of unanswered questions about how this mechanism works,"" adds Weil, noting that one possible explanation might involve the body's desire to control its own food intake.",97,benefits of physical activity,-2.0574090480804443,70,no_prompt,7,0.31390134529147984,366,9

Fox News spoke with several men who suffered from these conditions and all claimed they had experienced similar symptoms after having their hands broken or injured. A majority of those affected have since recovered - however some suffer lingering effects.

Many men are not only left in pain after an injury but, according to Dr. Siegel, they're often left unable to complete everyday tasks such as using the bathroom and even getting dressed.

In one case, FoxNews.com reported, a man was unable to get out of bed when his hand was accidentally shattered off during his bath time. His wife went into labor and doctors later discovered her baby boy was born without arms. The child, now named Jack, received his first set of arms when he was just two weeks old.

""You'd expect to see them [those] guys on a football field, but there were people sitting next to me and saying 'how did you do it?' I couldn't tell him because I wasn't looking. I wanted to hear what happened,"" Jack's father said.

Another young man, FoxNews.com reported, got his arm crushed in a fall while taking a shower. He still suffers from painful twinges during which he will have to sit down and cover his eyes to avoid seeing.

While most cases don't progress past minor injuries, some victims end up needing amputation. In October 2014, a mother of three lost both legs in a freak accident while walking through the woods. Her daughter was found unresponsive and covered in blood. Doctors say she may have had a stroke or slipped on ice.

Despite being able to walk again, this woman remains confined to a wheelchair.

One of the worst-affected families we interviewed were women whose husbands took jobs with security companies where working in a dangerous environment put them at greater risk of injury than they would ever encounter in their own homes.

These incidents lead many to believe that security guards",121,numb fingers arthritis,-13.234679222106934,166,no_prompt,7,0.9325842696629213,408,0

""I had been feeling more depressed than usual over the last few years and thought that I needed some direction,"" she says. ""My husband wanted me to see a psychologist but my sister said I should go to a chiropractor.""

She went into the office, spoke to the doctor for 45 minutes about her condition, he told her that she didn't have anything wrong and that it might be time to leave the practice.

In 2009 she discovered a new chiropractor through a friend. She had never been so impressed by another practitioner's care or knowledge of the diagnosis, treatment and results.

Soon after that, she began seeing him regularly. When they were both working full-time jobs and their financial situation worsened, the chiropractor offered them both discounted rates for services such as pain management and physical therapy.

It has helped her so much that since then, Dr. Sommers doesn't feel like she needs an appointment anymore.

""Chiropractic really changed my life because it allowed me to live better and get back on track in terms of my personal growth,"" she says.

As much as Chiropractors can do, there are limits to what can be done with their expertise. The American Chiropractic Association discourages people from going to chiropractors who don't have a degree in health care and even recommends against doctors from other countries practicing in the U.S., citing its own research.

""If we all put together our heads, this would probably be the best place to start thinking about getting back to health,"" says Paul McLeod, chief executive officer at the association.

The researchers' findings suggest that skin-to-skin contact between children with eczema and their parents, regardless of whether the child is prone to the condition or not, may help them control its severity in the future.

They noted that it's unclear how these benefits may translate to actual prevention — there was no direct evidence for any effect on the development of the disease itself. Still, they said it seems ""likely"" that children with eczema will get better treatment if they are able to interact more closely with their mothers during such visits.

Of course, this study has limitations: For one thing, it involved only a small number of children, so it can't prove that contact between family members and kids who have eczema also helps prevent the disease. And it also doesn't tell us what kind of impact this could have on other types of allergies, like those caused by foods.

MS has been linked to an increased risk for developing other forms of dementia and may be more likely in individuals with cognitive decline or age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, there are few studies on the effects of chronic high blood pressure on MS progression. If you have hypertension, make sure that your physician knows about your condition, as there are many medications that can alter BP levels (see our article on MS treatment options). As for any potential relationship between MS and cardiovascular disease, some evidence suggests that it might increase the risk by preventing platelet aggregation. The American Heart Association recommends that persons with MS start taking aspirin at least 1 month before starting therapy, since high blood pressure increases the likelihood of thrombosis. Also, exercise, which helps reduce vascular inflammation, should be considered when managing MS symptoms.

What do I eat?

Your diet will determine whether you'll have good health, because eating food rich in nutrients such as vitamins A and C, fiber, magnesium, potassium, and sodium are key to good health. Some foods contain antioxidants and phytochemicals that help protect against cancer, improve sleep quality, and relieve pain. There's also research showing benefits from omega 3 fatty acids, but we need to wait until further study is done. Although most people experience positive changes in mood, weight, and energy level after they eat right, it's important to keep in mind that these are just guidelines. You shouldn't feel overwhelmed if you don't meet all recommendations. It is possible to eat healthy while maintaining healthy lifestyle habits that will help maintain or even improve your overall health. For example, cutting out alcohol and sugar can reduce stress and improve your sleep, reducing the chances of having heart attacks and strokes. On the flip side, losing weight and exercising regularly can lead to better weight management and improved body composition (muscle mass), so it's always best to consult your doctor before making major dietary changes.

In a study that followed 15,000 patients for 2 years, the use of oral antihistamines was found to be associated with an increased risk of developing MS and the development of relapses. The researchers noted in their review article that ""the possibility of such a relationship between oral antihistamine use and the development of MS or relapse has not been thoroughly investigated.""

This is important because it contradicts recent claims by the World Health Organization and the American Academy of Neurology that there is no association between antihistamines and MS. Indeed, those organizations have repeatedly suggested that this is a myth and that using them can cause severe side effects.

As the authors point out:

""The present study provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that both frequent and prolonged use of antihistamines may increase the risk of MS and/or the progression from nonrelapsing forms of MS to progressive forms. In addition, we observed that the use of antihistamines by individuals at high risk for MS increased the probability that they would develop subsequent MS and that these risks were more pronounced among patients whose disease progressed more rapidly than their predecessors. These findings are consistent with the concept of 'chronic inflammatory states' as used in our previous reports on antihistamines.""

Indeed, many doctors are now advising against the use of antihistamines (2, 3, 4). And a study published earlier this year in the British Medical Journal showed that people who took large doses of antihistamines were twice as likely to suffer chronic pain and fatigue compared to others without these conditions (5).

While most physicians will accept the fact that antihistamines prevent allergies and help alleviate dry eyes, most don't understand why they actually can cause damage. It turns out that some antihistamines may block a chemical called histone deacetylase (HDAC), which helps regulate how histones are made. As a result, HDACs can accumulate inside cells and become unstable over time causing cell death and inflammation. This leads to a range of autoimmune diseases including diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. In one survey of 800 primary care physicians, nearly half said that most of their patients had suffered an attack due to taking an antihistamine.

When you're young, you don't have any worries about anything. The world is filled with so much uncertainty that you just go through life feeling free. You know things will work out in the end – because you've seen your parents do it too. But as you get older, you start to worry a bit more. Your fears can become very real, even if they aren't. That's when it's time to think more deeply about how to deal with them.

You should definitely be asking yourself this question right now: ""How am I going to cope with this anxiety?"" If you are struggling with this kind of anxiety and you feel that it is affecting your overall wellbeing, then you need to seek help immediately. And I strongly encourage that you do. There are many ways to overcome this type of anxiety, which is why we always stress the importance of getting treatment for it. But first, you need to understand the reasons behind your concern. Then you need to ask yourself these questions:

Why do I worry?


What is my mental state at this moment?


Am I aware that this is an issue that may negatively impact me on a daily basis?


Is there something else I could be doing that would improve my situation?


Can I change some aspect of my life that has affected my anxiety or stress levels?


How can I take better care of myself now?


If you answer yes to any of these questions, then you need to try and figure out what's really causing this anxiety, rather than trying to ignore it. For instance, let's say you are worried about losing your job. You might spend a lot of time thinking back over every possible scenario of how your company may react to your departure. As soon as one becomes clear, then your mind wanders into other scenarios that seem less likely – such as when someone gets promoted, or when your boss loses their temper with you. However, if you knew that there was no chance of anything happening, then you wouldn't be worrying so much. Why? Because this thought process doesn't make sense to you. This brings us to the next question. How are I coping with this anxiety?

The study was published in the journal Psychological Medicine.

In the study, researchers at UCLA and Johns Hopkins University examined data from more than 35,000 people who were part of a national health survey between 2006 and 2013. They followed up with those participants every two years to determine whether they had become addicted to prescription painkillers or other opiates like heroin.

""We're saying that if you're going through an addiction treatment program you're likely to be using opioids,"" said lead author Dr. Paul Sacks, associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and member of the department's Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences. ""There are many different reasons for this,"" he added, including psychological factors such as stress and negative experiences with family members. But it also has to do with being socially isolated and feeling unable to achieve normal social interactions with others.

Researchers used computerized questionnaires to measure how often subjects reported experiencing problems with their personal relationships, work performance, sense of self-worth and feelings of depression and anxiety. These questions measured how much time they spent engaging in risky behaviors such as driving while impaired, drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes. The answers were then correlated with the use of opioids during the previous year.

Participants who experienced more severe forms of abuse reported significantly lower scores on these measures compared to those who reported no history of drug dependence. Those who had abused prescription drugs before meeting the criteria showed increased risk for becoming opioid dependent over time when compared to those without any prior exposure.


As the authors point out, these findings come after decades of research indicating that people with mental illness have higher rates of prescription opioid dependence than healthy controls. This is most evident among patients diagnosed with bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder (MDD) and substance use disorders, the group looked at. However, only one in five patients in the current study met criteria for ADHD, which may account for some of the observed differences.

While the overall results show that there is evidence to suggest that people with personality disorders experience greater vulnerability to opioid use, it is important to note that all patients should receive proper psychiatric assessment to ensure that they meet diagnostic criteria for a mental illness.

""Our study shows that even though individuals with personality disorders appear to be at increased risk, we need to recognize that they still require appropriate psychosocial support to prevent them from using drugs,"" said co-author Dr. James Fadiman, director of the Center for Addiction Research",114,borderline personality disorder symptoms,-12.848484992980955,105,no_prompt,7,0.9722222222222222,434,3

20 mg once daily for 5 weeks

40 mg once daily for 6 weeks

The above is the recommended dose to treat relapses. If you experience side effects, consult your physician before increasing or discontinuing treatment with this drug.


Side Effects:


Allergic reaction has been reported in persons taking Rituxan at higher doses. There have also been reports of severe allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis). The most common reactions reported by physicians are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle aches, chills, dizziness, headache, insomnia, dyspepsia, irritability, rash, chest tightness, tremor, palpitations, myalgia, vertigo, increased urination, decreased appetite, blurred vision, and reduced urination. Serious adverse events (SAEs) have been reported, including death.


Drug interactions:


Because Rituxan may interact with certain medications, it is important to discuss all possible potential drug interaction(s) with your healthcare professional prior to starting therapy.


Laboratory Tests:


Normal laboratory values for creatinine, liver enzymes, anti-carcinogenic antibodies, blood glucose, potassium, total cholesterol, and triglycerides should be normal; however, if any of these tests show abnormal results, consult your health care provider for further evaluation. A complete physical examination including blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and ECG should be performed on each patient with clinical signs of serious illness or injury. In patients who present with signs of infection, hepatitis, or gastrointestinal bleeding, the presence of fever, unexplained weight loss, or renal impairment should prompt rapid assessment by a physician.


Recommended Regimens:


For relapse prevention:


Rituxan will not work unless you follow the instructions for each individual patient individually. If you miss one dose, take another that day as soon as you remember. Continue to take Rituxan until at least four of the following symptoms occur within 48 hours after the last missed dose was taken:

The second group of trials included studies that were designed to assess changes in thyroid function with the use of anti-thyroid drugs. These studies showed that while some of these agents improved the thyroid's ability to produce thyroid hormones, other agents such as riluzole or nifedipine actually increased the number of circulating T3 cells. It is not clear why this occurred. One theory suggests that the decrease in thyroid hormone production may have had an adverse effect on the body's response to infection (such as from Helicobacter pylori), resulting in excessive inflammation, which would lead to the loss of T4. In addition, the authors believe that the rise in TSH levels might have caused a reduction in T4, leading to an increase in cortisol levels. The latter finding was especially interesting given that many autoimmune diseases are characterized by hypercortisolism, including Hashimoto's disease, Graves' disease, and autoimmune diabetes mellitus. Thus, it is possible that the elevation in cortisol may have contributed to the more severe disease states in the children in these two groups.

An additional study used a different method to evaluate the effects of anti-thyroid medications: imaging techniques like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While these procedures have been shown to detect abnormalities in thyroid hormone metabolism in infants with iodine deficiency syndromes [2], they do not always identify what causes such abnormalities. Consequently, these procedures can also miss thyroid function alterations due to metabolic disturbances. In the current trial, the investigators followed up every child who received at least one dose of either levothyroxine (L) or methyltetrahydrofuran (MTF) for any reason between 3 months and 6 years of age, without prior diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction. MRI scans were performed at regular intervals during the follow-up period and evaluated for changes in thyroid gland size. Additionally, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measurements were taken at intervals over time.

When compared with controls, those receiving L, but not MTF, exhibited an increase in both average height and weight for both boys and girls between 4 and 7 years of age, particularly among those with low baseline thyroid antibody titers (P<0.0001). This difference remained significant after adjustment for multiple factors associated with thyroid hormone secretion including maternal smoking, age, and gender. However, there was no difference in total serum TSH, free T4, or total thyroid",123,hypothyroidism symptoms,-12.234526634216309,133,no_prompt,7,0.8209876543209876,397,0

Autism - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), also known as pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, or PDD (also called autism spectrum disorder) is a neurodevelopmental disability that affects how people learn, think and communicate. It is characterized by impaired communication skills, repetitive behaviors, restricted interests, and impairments in social interaction and adaptive behavior. Autistic individuals may exhibit a range of behaviors, such as repetitive hand movements, body gestures, speech patterns, hand eye coordination, facial expressions, stereotyped gait and movements, unusual interest and attention seeking behaviors. As a result of these behavioral problems, autism can lead to significant distress and can be lifelong. There are more than 40 different kinds of ASD, but most of them have common elements, which include: Communication difficulties;

gpt2-large_55,"The answer will depend on your type of MS, how severe it is and whether you are receiving treatment.

There are two main types of MS:

Primary progressive (PP) – The primary progressive form of MS is the most common, affecting around 5% of people with MS. This type affects a patient's muscles and bones and causes loss of movement in all limbs. In some cases this can cause paralysis or death. Primary progressive MS usually starts in early adulthood. There are no known treatments for PP. PPD (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) – A less frequent variant of PPD, which also strikes children, occurs when there is an accumulation of T-cells that attack brain cells. It may not appear until after age 45 but symptoms can include weakness, fatigue, headaches, irritability, memory problems, confusion and depression. Treatment varies between different drugs and often involves using steroids. The drug used for PPD differs from the drug used for PPS but it should be similar. People with PP may benefit from switching to a different steroid, although this may be dangerous because it increases risk of heart disease if taken by pregnant women.

Secondary progressive MS (SPMS): The second type of MS, commonly called SPMS (primary progressive multisymptom illness), affects about 1% of adults and 2% of children. Symptoms may occur over several months and may include shortness of breath, muscle spasms, vision changes, numbness and tingling in hands and feet, difficulty walking, speech difficulties and balance problems. When SPMS attacks the central nervous system it causes problems with thinking and judgement. Some patients have milder symptoms and more progress with treatment. Although there are no known treatments for SPMS, these are being investigated by new medicines such as rituximab (Celexa).

Although most people live into their 70s, sometimes even 80, many people do not have any symptoms at all. If you do experience signs and symptoms, it is important to see your GP.

What do I need to know before you visit my GP?

You should see your doctor if you think you might have secondary progressive MS (also called primary progressive multisymptom illness). You should not start taking medicine unless you're sure you need to.

It should be noted that the USDA reports that less than 0.5% of Americans have Type 2 diabetes; this means that only about 1% of the population may be at higher risk for diabetes (20). As such, the association does not consider Type 2 diabetes as being in itself a cause of increased mortality or morbidity associated with their consumption of red meat and processed meat. However, it does recommend that people consume fewer calories per serving of these foods if they do decide to cut back on red meat or processed meat altogether. This information was not included in the latest report from the NIH, which was released last week. Therefore, a high-quality review of these two recent studies could provide us some insight into whether increased risk of diabetes among certain populations can be attributed to red meat or processed meat alone.

Another aspect that needs to be addressed when comparing the effects of red meat and processed meat is the amount of fiber consumed in both foods. While many carbohydrates are also found in beef, pork, poultry, fish, nuts, dairy products, and legumes, most of these are considered ""empty calories"" because no additional nutrients are produced when eaten. Moreover, the USDA reports that a low-carbohydrate diet has few nutritional benefits compared with a traditional, moderate carbohydrate diet (21). Red meat contains significant amounts of saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, monounsaturated fats, protein, and vitamin E. Although we do not know what effect these factors have on the body, it would be prudent to limit intake of red meat in order to reduce the risks of chronic inflammation, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.

Although there appears to be an inverse correlation between total energy intake and CVD events, this relationship may be different for each individual. To date, few large randomized trials have looked at",22,my risk for developing type 2 diabetes,-7.24461555480957,155,no_prompt,7,0.62,426,15

The study's findings were published in the February issue of Neurology, a medical journal for neurologists and neuroscience researchers from around the world. The paper is available online now.

Researchers led by Professors Stephen W. Lohse and Michael J. McQuiston at Brown University evaluated the association between brain volume changes and MS symptoms using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They compared subjects with active MS to controls who did not have the disease and also to subjects without MS.

""A good measure of brain size changes is how much you can see through your head,"" said McQuiston, senior author on the paper, which was co-authored by former students Ravi Naidu and Jason Yung. ""In this study we found that people with more severe MS had more loss of brain tissue than those without the disease.""

MS has long been associated with a decline in white matter connections between different parts of the brain - areas responsible for reasoning, language and other mental functions.

Previous studies have shown that these same white-matter networks are affected during milder forms of MS, as well. However, until now, no one had determined whether there were differences among people with MS, healthy people or even older adults who didn't develop the illness.

To determine if the observed differences could be explained by MS itself, the researchers measured brain volumes within 15 MRI regions identified by previous research. In addition, they examined three groups: people with mild MS (defined by having minimal symptoms), those with moderate severity (defined as having moderate to profound symptoms) and those with very severe MS (defined as having severe symptoms).

They found that people with MS had smaller brains across all brain regions tested, but the effect sizes were larger in people with severe MS than in those with mild and moderate severity.

It was also found that people with MS who experienced most frequent exacerbations had higher brain volumes than others.

This may explain why many patients with MS experience only mild symptoms and are often left alone - there are few triggers for exacerbation. But those who do encounter serious relapses might find their condition worsening over time, possibly due to inflammation. This would increase the risk for developing MS.

""If it turns out that MS causes brain changes in some people, then we should be able to predict when someone will get more severe relapses,"" McQuiston said. ""We're just beginning to understand what these changes mean, so there's lots of potential for new treatments to address",57,multiple sclerosis stages phases,-11.224974632263184,74,no_prompt,7,0.357487922705314,418,0

Sleep Problems in Older Adults

The following study was conducted on a sample of women and men aged 65 years and older. The participants were randomly assigned to either a control group that received no treatment or one of four different treatments. All the subjects took part in an 8 week program that included cognitive testing, a regular checkup, and visits to a neurologist for evaluation and follow up. During the eight weeks it is estimated that 5% of each patient's waking hours were spent in bed. It has been suggested that people who sleep too much should consider taking their medication. This article discusses possible explanations for why we might have increased rates of insomnia in this age group. The researchers conclude that at least some of these increases could be attributed to factors that increase risk for depression and other illnesses including obesity.

In another study, researchers from Washington State University found that people who suffered from chronic insomnia reported lower levels of social relationships than those without such insomnia and had higher scores on measures of psychological distress. They concluded that chronically ill patients may benefit from more frequent screening tests, which are available over the counter. However, they also noted that these individuals typically do not seek out help until symptoms start to escalate. Therefore, it remains unclear if there is any relationship between sleep deprivation and the development of physical health issues like diabetes.

Finally, Dr. Steven D. Fetter and colleagues investigated whether chronic insomnia affects brain function. They recruited 974 adults with chronic insomnia and 731 healthy controls. Subjects completed a battery of neuropsychological tests during pre-treatment, post-treatment, 3 months after treatment, 2 years later, and 12 years after treatment. Results showed that, compared to healthy controls, both patients with chronic insomnia and those with insomnia without sleep disorders performed worse on some tests.

The most common reason for requesting your tax back from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is ""non-compliance"" with the requirements of the Income Tax Act (the act). This means you did not follow these instructions correctly when filing your return or paying the tax due. CRA requires us to send you a letter explaining what happened and asking how we can correct the situation. If you think you should have received a refund within 30 days of claiming your tax refund, you may find information on our Refund Policy page about why it takes longer than usual to process your claim. If you feel your tax was incorrectly withheld or that there were errors made during processing, contact your local office of the CRA for help.

In the current study, we used a cohort of patients with metastatic prostate cancer to assess whether treatment with the combination of cisplatin plus tamoxifen led to an increase in the risk for clinical progression or death compared with cisplatin alone or with tamoxifen alone (2). We also examined whether there was any difference between cisplatin, tamoxifen, and placebo in terms of the incidence of prostatectomy/prostate biopsy recurrence during follow up and the number of subsequent deaths within 2 years after diagnosis of disease progression. Finally, we investigated the effect of tamoxifen and cisplatin combined on long-term survival in the same patient population as well as the effects of tamoxifen and placebo on the quality of life, as measured by the PSA score at 3 year intervals.

METHODS

Participants

We recruited men aged ≥50 years from four US centers: Chicago; Boston; New York City; and Pittsburgh. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, defined as survival to one year following initial diagnosis of disease progression. Patients were excluded if they had surgery within the preceding 3 months [26], had a history of blood clotting disorders [27]–[29], were receiving or considering systemic agents that could reduce the activity of prostaglandins or lower their intrinsic activity [30]–[33], or were taking anticoagulant therapy for cardiovascular causes [34]. Exclusion criteria included a history of malignancy other than localized adenocarcinoma, cancer that progressed beyond nonmetastasis, abnormal urine screening results prior to enrollment, use of any systemic medications, recent radiation therapy, malignant liver, renal or hepatic tumors, or previous invasive procedures. Our participants also underwent physical examinations including self-reported weight, height, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose level before enrollment, urinary calcium excretion, and serum creatinine levels [35]. All patients provided informed consent through an independent research ethics committee (IEC) approved by institutional review boards at all participating institutions.

Study Design and Oversight

gpt2-large_58,"As an example of the problem with this research, consider that, among all people in Canada who have a genetic link to MS, some are not at risk. For these individuals, the association between their family history and MS has been shown to be quite small or nonexistent (the ""small"" being only about 1 per cent). In contrast, for those with two or more copies of the DQB1*0602 mutation, there is strong evidence that their risk of developing MS increases by up to 60 times if they inherit it from a first-degree relative. That same increase is seen in people without a family history of MS. And even for families with no such relatives, the increased risk for multiple sclerosis can reach as high as 30 times higher than for the general population. Thus, because of its strong association with multiple sclerosis, the DQB1*0602 mutation is strongly associated with multiple sclerosis risk.

The study also found that people who inherited the mutated allele had an almost 2:1 chance of getting MS over the course of their lives. This result confirms the hypothesis that gene mutations play a significant role in MS development. As we'll see below, when I talk about genes and disease, you don't need to worry about whether a particular person inherits one mutation or another; what matters is the genetic basis behind the disease. Here's where things get tricky: the researchers didn't include many other types of risk factors, which could contribute significantly to both the frequency of the disease and the genetic susceptibility to it. Because of this, they cannot yet say definitively how much of the overall risk for MS may come down to genetics and how much may go beyond it. They do suggest that future studies should take into account factors like smoking and alcohol consumption, and also that future epidemiological studies should be conducted on different populations.

But this is hardly surprising. If anything, we know that risk doesn't always follow a simple linear path. When looking at the incidence rates across countries, a clear pattern emerges: while certain diseases tend to cluster together around certain geographic regions, others don't seem to make much sense until you start taking into account specific environmental exposures. The exact mechanism that leads to some diseases' clustering isn't completely understood, but our understanding is growing. We know that exposure to pesticides or other chemicals can cause neurological disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. Furthermore, researchers believe that the way viruses interact with our immune system makes them especially dangerous to us — and in turn causes some forms of autism. These findings mean that",58,Risk to develop multiple sclerosis,-1.1664514541625977,17,no_prompt,7,0.0735930735930736,437,22

As shown in Figure 4, this association was not significant for all subtypes of hypercholesterolemia, but showed an effect in nonobese subjects. The pooled RR of acute lung failure in obese subjects compared to nonobese controls was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.73–1.06). In contrast, the risk ratio for acutely ill hypercholesterolemic subjects was 2.28 (95% CI: 1.20–5.39), suggesting that obesity increased the likelihood of developing acute lung injury among both hypertensive and nonhypertensive subjects. When comparing subjects with and without diabetes mellitus, BMI was associated with greater odds of acute lung injury [HR, 1.70; 95% CI: 1.10–2.52], although there was no evidence of heterogeneity across categories of BMI [P value for interaction = 0.48]. For those diagnosed with CVD, an increase in body mass index (BMI) was independently associated with a higher risk of acute lung injury [RR, 3.45; 95% CI: 1.31–9.72]. There was also substantial evidence of a direct link between BMI and acute lung injury. Compared with nonobese subjects with diabetes mellitus, overweight and obese individuals were significantly more likely to develop acute lung injury (Table 5 ).

Discussion

In this large prospective cohort study, we found that excess body weight and obesity are independent predictors of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This result is consistent with recent studies demonstrating an inverse relationship between BMI and COPD [3]–[8], [19], which has been interpreted as reflecting a beneficial effect of adiposity on airway inflammation and dysfunction, leading to reduced bronchial responsiveness [3], [15]. Our findings support these earlier reports by showing that BMI was a strong predictor of a higher prevalence of severe acute lung injury among participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus, even after adjustment for age, smoking status, gender, race/ethnicity, education level, socioeconomic class, physical activity, exercise tolerance, alcohol consumption and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease history. These results highlight the importance of understanding the complex interplay between obesity and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

A total of 579 patients with early-stage, high grade non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were included in the study and followed up for a median duration of 28 months before randomisation; 98% had been treated previously by chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Patients were randomly allocated to one of two treatments: an oral biotin (20 mg per day) combined with a daily vitamin C supplement (50 mg per day), or a placebo tablet containing no additional active ingredients. Both treatment groups received a standardised regimen of intravenous, intrathecal, and subcutaneous injections of biotin at weekly intervals throughout follow-up. At baseline, all patients received routine medical history including physical examination, laboratory tests, CT scan images and chest radiography to assess progression and diagnosis of disease, as well as a medical assessment of clinical response. At 6 months post-randomization, patients were asked if they felt more or less likely to be diagnosed with a relapse within 2 years after initial presentation of NSCLC. Patients were also provided with a summary of their symptoms at this time. The primary endpoint was a change from the previous month's overall symptom score on a modified Rankin scale to better than 50% improvement. Secondary endpoints included survival, global functional disability and change in quality of life over the follow-up period.

Patients were eligible to participate in the trial if they presented with NSCLC between 1 September 2013 and 31 December 2015 who had not already undergone surgery, had been receiving adjuvant radiotherapy, or had taken a new medication for at least 12 months. An investigator selected each patient who met these criteria. No patients were excluded because of pre-existing disease that prevented them from being eligible or because they were receiving chemotherapy or radiological therapies. Patients were then informed of the nature of the trial, including the potential risks and benefits. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

But if you were to ask me, would I call it psychodynamic psychotherapy because it was my mother who died, and not any particular kind of psychotherapist, then I'm going to say no, but there is certainly an overlap. And one of the reasons why it's difficult, when you're trying to make sense of this kind of trauma, is that there are so many things happening at once that it really becomes very hard to talk about them all together. One of the problems is that I don't understand how anything could be true or possible and yet seem false and impossible—but that is a problem because I think psychodynamics is one way to look at reality. Psychoanalytic theories can also be used as tools to help us explore and investigate what's happening in our lives, both within ourselves and with others.

In a 2009 study that was part of the Reproductive Health Initiative, participants were asked about their method of contraceptive use at baseline and 4 years later. The researchers found that women with higher levels of depression showed an increase in the number of pills taken on average every month. They also had an increased risk of having an unplanned pregnancy by 25%. In addition, they experienced increased depressive symptoms over time; a significant decline in self-reported depression was noted after 4 years compared to baseline. There is no clear evidence linking antidepressant medications to this trend. Other factors likely include changes in sexual behavior, including more frequent sex in general, fewer pregnancies, and less satisfaction with sexual intercourse. For example, a 2012 review article concluded: ""If one considers all major social variables in terms of their effect on female reproductive health, antidepressants are among the least important.""9 This may be because many women who take them don't really need them. Although it has been suggested that medication for mental disorders is linked to decreased sperm quality, a 2008 meta analysis by Shifman et al. found that there was little relationship between treatment with anti-depressants and male fertility.10

Other research suggests that men experience greater stress if they have a history of depression.11 In fact, men suffering from depression are more than twice as likely to delay or terminate an unintended pregnancy than those without depression.12 Given these findings, what can we learn from this? One possibility is that men's depression does not affect their ability to make choices about reproduction. It appears that some forms of depression are associated with reduced sperm viability. Additionally, other studies suggest that men who suffer from anxiety, PTSD, and alcohol abuse often have lower sperm counts.13 It might therefore be safe to assume that these men face additional psychological distress if they choose to become parents.

Another idea is that depression alters the brain's reward circuitry. That means that women who are depressed may experience diminished pleasure when trying to satisfy their lustful urges, which may impact their desire for children. Another possibility is that depression reduces a woman's ability to feel connected to her body—for example, by making her less able to respond to pain during childbirth. In light of these results, it may be prudent for women seeking contraception to seek help before starting any type of birth control regimen.

""This study suggests that asthma is not only more common among people who already have lung diseases but also that there may be a heightened risk for these conditions if one does not take care to ensure an adequate oxygen supply,"" said senior author Dr. Paul G. Stacey, director of the Pulmonary and Critical Care Unit at the University Hospital of Leicester in England. ""It's important we continue to educate and encourage people to become educated about the condition.""

In addition to this new finding, previous studies showed asthma was associated with increased rates of COPD, according to the report. In other words, it seems those with COPD might be particularly vulnerable to developing asthma because they tend to spend longer on a regular basis in unhealthy environments, such as high-risk occupations like construction workers. It's possible that some work practices could contribute to asthma or cause COPD by disrupting normal breathing patterns, making them harder for the body to regulate and therefore causing chronic inflammation in the lungs, the authors wrote.

The current study looked at lung function in 563 adults with COPD diagnosed between 2004 and 2011. All participants had been hospitalized at least once for severe respiratory illness (including asthma), which included wheezing, shortness of breath, pneumonia and acute bronchitis. They were evaluated using the Respiratory Function Index (RFI) scale, a standardized physical test used to evaluate pulmonary function and measures the ability to use inhalation techniques such as chest compression and coughing. Participants received standard doses of inhaled steroids to treat. After about two months, researchers performed chest radiographs to measure lung volumes and airflow through the trachea and bronchi and measured the number of breaths taken per minute at each site using pulse oximetry.

There was no significant difference in lung function between the groups after adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, smoking status and history of heart disease. However, the risk of having an abnormal RFI score after controlling for these factors increased significantly in patients with COPD versus healthy control subjects from 29 percent for every 10 units increase in RFI score in the combined group, to 40 percent for every additional unit change.

Diagnosis:

A comprehensive physical exam including blood work, liver function tests, a complete abdominal examination, cardiac evaluation including ECG, complete blood count, and a urinalysis are done to rule out many other illnesses, such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, cancer, and other diseases. Other health issues should be ruled out including thyroid problems, high cholesterol, alcoholism, and certain types of tumors and infections (especially MRSA) as these can lead to GI disorders. Gastrointestinal examinations include gastric emptying and stool analysis and endoscopy is often used in the early stages for confirmation. A gastroscopic examination may confirm ulcers or small intestinal bleeding and allow a detailed history to document all the possible causes of the illness. An endoscopic examination will assess the extent of the damage and identify any abnormalities within the bowel lining, such as polyps and stones which are more likely to be the result of infection rather than an underlying problem like dyspepsia or Crohn's Disease. Imaging techniques have improved dramatically over recent years but imaging studies of the colon and rectum still aren't widely available due to cost and complications. It is important to note that there are several different types of inflammatory bowel disease which are diagnosed using similar diagnostic methods including colonoscopy, biopsy, and ultrasound imaging. In addition, the use of antibiotics and immunosuppressants is becoming increasingly common as their side effects are increasing. If you suspect your child has irritable bowel syndrome, consult your doctor immediately for further testing to determine if this condition is actually causing the symptoms. Diagnostic tests such as CT scan may show evidence of inflammation at the site of the injury and an MRI may show a submucosal lesion with potential changes to the surrounding tissues. If surgery is necessary, it must be performed under general anesthesia because gastrointestinal injuries can become life-threatening quickly when the patient has to breathe on his/her own. The surgical team should begin by examining the internal organs to make sure they are intact and healthy before making any treatment decisions. The goal of surgical management is to remove as much material from the area of damage as possible while minimizing further trauma to surrounding tissue.",109,ehlers danlos syndrome POTS nausea stomach pain,-10.746994018554688,30,no_prompt,8,0.75,406,0

And remember: You are free to take medication for MS without fear of relapse.

You can use this link to check whether your insurance does cover MS treatments like MS Therapy and other non-pharmacologic therapies. If your insurer offers these services, they may also offer medications such as antidepressants or corticosteroids to treat your symptoms. Be sure to check with your insurers before starting any new medication!

Mild to moderate fatigue, weakness, dizziness, headache, depression, irritability, difficulty concentrating, muscle stiffness, insomnia, pain, loss of coordination, memory impairment, confusion, headaches, and vision changes are common. Some patients report hearing voices, hearing things others cannot hear, and experiencing hallucinations.

The average number of treatments per patient was 2.8 (SD = 1.4; range = 0–17) for patients who received all three triple negative breast cancer treatments in combination, compared to 3.2 (SD = 1.3; range = 0–14) for those receiving only one of these treatments.

A total of 684 participants were recruited from 18 European countries with high-risk HPV infection (n = 562) and 815 participants from the United States (n = 2391), including 2028 women with no history of cervical or oropharyngeal cancers, 1636 women diagnosed with invasive non-melanoma skin cancer, and 1178 women with non-melanoma lesions. Of the 582 women screened, 726 had both an intact cervix and a positive result for HPV DNA at screening or were treated with colposcopy and/or surgery. Median follow-up was 29.5 years among the control group and 33.0 years among women randomized to receive any form of HPV vaccine. There were no significant differences in age, race/ethnicity, baseline medical condition, number of previous cancers, or time since last Pap test in either comparison group.

Although not specifically designed to target oral contraceptive users, the use of HPV vaccines could be used as part of the prevention of cervical cancer by increasing the proportion of vaccinated women who are also likely to have been exposed to HPV types that cause genital warts (i.e., genital warts, low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions [GISL], and carcinomas). In this study, we assessed whether the timing of administration of HPV vaccines was associated with long-term mortality risk among female sex workers and sexual partners of sex workers.

Because cervical cancer is the most common type of cancer among sexually active women worldwide, it has important public health implications because it affects almost every region of the world.1 As a consequence, there is strong interest in improving current screening methods and identifying new risk factors for cervical cancer to reduce overall morbidity and mortality among girls and young women.2 Therefore, several international studies have investigated the association between the timing of vaccination against HPV16 and some of its potential adverse outcomes. For example, cervical cancer incidence rates declined significantly during a period of substantial increase in vaccination coverage in Denmark from 1996 to 2008.3 However, other possible reasons for the decline have not",118,stage 4 triple negative breast cancer treatment,-4.561532974243164,67,no_prompt,8,0.3004484304932735,390,9

However, there is also a small increased risk among those whose first period was less than 10 years ago compared with those who did not get their first period at all, especially if they have never been diagnosed with MS.

If you were diagnosed with MS before age 25 and experienced symptoms during this time period that lasted longer than four months or last longer than one year, your risk of having an active MS relapse increases significantly. For example: If your initial diagnosis was in the third trimester of pregnancy and you developed symptoms from late September through December of 2008, your risk of developing MS relapse between August 2013 and February 2015 would be 30%. If your previous diagnosis was in any of the second half of pregnancy (starting at 16 weeks) up until delivery (i.e., it took more than seven months), your risk increase would be 37%. The increased risk for the first 18 months of a woman's life after her first period may occur even though the onset of symptoms has occurred within the past few months.

There are various factors that can influence the development of MS. Many factors are known to contribute to MS including genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Other contributing factors include other conditions affecting the immune system, medications taken by patients, medication side effects, and treatment response with steroids, radiation therapy and surgery. Some studies show that a person's gender may play a role in how long it takes to develop multiple sclerosis symptoms. Women tend to experience fewer MS-related complications when they have MS at older ages. This could potentially provide additional support for research on male MS prevention strategies, such as using testosterone injections to lower female-to-male ratios.

The following biological diseases are often seen as having an influence on society and individuals. These include cancer, stroke, diabetes, heart disease and other diseases of the central nervous system.

Cancer: The main cause of death in the United States is cancer, which kills more than half of all Americans each year. People who die from cancer may be either young or old; it affects men and women equally and it is caused by a variety of different types of cells. Cancer is often treatable with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery and/or medication. However, many cancers can come back once they are cured. This is why there is such a need to understand what is causing them. For example, smoking causes lung cancer and other forms of tobacco use also leads to breast cancer and colon cancer. Both of these illnesses are preventable if people quit smoking. Many people die from this type of cancer every year. If you smoke, get vaccinated against the flu or have regular check-ups for your body's immune system, you should live longer. Additionally, the CDC recommends that pregnant women stay away from cigarettes. If you smoke during pregnancy, ask your doctor before getting pregnant so you know what will happen to your baby. Smoking during pregnancy could harm your baby, especially if he or she develops respiratory problems due to the nicotine in tobacco products. Research has shown that mothers who smoke during pregnancy tend to give birth to babies who have higher rates of asthma, allergies and other health issues. It is important to consider all possible health risks when deciding whether or not to start a family. Some studies suggest that maternal smoking during pregnancy can increase risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

Children do not need fluoride in their diet, but when they are old enough, some children will develop fluorosis. Fluorosis is a serious condition that occurs on the teeth because of fluoride build-up in the body. This buildup is caused by the presence of fluoride in their blood. When fluoride builds up on the teeth, it causes damage to teeth and gums. The result of this damage may be difficulty with chewing or grinding, as well as an increase in cavities and plaque. Children with high levels of fluoride in their system are more likely to have dental problems later in life.

gpt2-large_62,"If you're in a job that requires you to be physically active and has some sort of physical activity requirement (such as an office or clinic), is it possible to meet those requirements through exercise without using drugs?

Is it even worth exercising when your MS symptoms are so severe? Are there any benefits for exercise to alleviate fatigue and relieve MS symptoms that don't involve disease-causing substances? How can exercise help with pain, inflammation and cognitive impairment when many of the symptoms may have been caused by a ""false"" or exaggerated sense of muscle weakness?

The answer to all these questions depends on who you ask. Some people think they cannot exercise while still managing their MS symptoms. Others suggest that it's not worthwhile because exercise might exacerbate MS symptoms. These responses reflect the conflicting views about exercise and MS.

Some doctors believe that most patients can exercise safely without taking certain drugs — especially if they do so regularly. For example, Dr. William D. Schaffner, MD, director of the University of Michigan Health System's MIND Institute, believes that exercise is safe when it does not interfere with treatment; in fact, he recommends regular cardiovascular exercise and low-impact aerobic activities such as walking or running as part of his comprehensive MS management program. He notes, however, that moderate intensity physical activity like brisk walking and jogging should only be done between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., every day.

Dr. Timothy Parnes, PhD, director of the Center for Biomedical Research, School of Medicine at the University of California Davis, agrees that exercise could lead to higher levels of blood sugar and insulin in some individuals. But Dr. Parnes said that more research is needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn: ""We need to know whether high-intensity exercise does improve the clinical course of MS.""

What About Exercise During Treatment?

Most experts agree that if patients feel they have no alternative but exercise during treatment, then there's nothing wrong with doing so. The idea is not to reduce exercise time, but rather to extend the duration of periods when MS sufferers are able to exercise without interference from medications. That means trying to increase activity time after each dose of medication, which usually happens gradually over several weeks.

However, as Dr. D'Souza points out, exercise is rarely recommended within the first week after starting a new drug regimen. In fact, studies show that exercise helps promote better tolerance to medication.

gpt2-large_35,"Yes, it is. There are several reasons why this may be so – and some of the most important ones will come into play when you discuss which form of low carb/high fat eating is right for your particular situation. One reason that it's very easy to get stuck in a cycle of ""ketosis"" is that some people find that they can't really get away from their favourite foods – like chocolate or ice cream. So one way to break out of the pattern might be simply by switching back to traditional high carbohydrate/low fat foods. That will mean switching to whole food carbohydrates (which should not be hard if you keep an eye on the nutritional values) but I'll cover how and what you can do differently here:

What is Whole Food Carbohydrates?

Whole foods are carbs in the form of starch, fats and proteins. You can think of them as having all 3 components of your body being held together at once. In fact, any type of complex carbohydrate would qualify as a whole food. We've already discussed what happens when we have too much of these types of nutrients in our system, namely insulin resistance, hypoglycemia, obesity and diabetes. When our bodies become overloaded with these different kinds of nutrition, there are many health problems associated with both chronic and acute exposure.

So, although some people find that their blood sugar levels don't respond well to certain refined forms of carbohydrates such as white bread, white rice and pasta, they must consume more than just plain old flour, sugar and salt. The key is to eat a balanced diet full of these good fats and protein sources. Here are some examples of simple whole grain products that are excellent source of essential fatty acids and protein:

Brown Rice

Quinoa

Mixed Greens

""The most important thing is to make sure that your core is strong and you're not too fatigued,"" says Tynan. ""You need to get the heart rate up, and the intensity of the workout has a huge effect on how much energy you put into it.""

If you can't do an exercise like this in between workouts, there are other ways to improve your core strength without doing any stretching or gymnastics:

Stay hydrated: Drink water during any workout—and not just before you go out. If you don't have access to one of those water bottles available at gyms or pools, drink plenty of cool (not hot) water. Make sure to sip it slowly because cold drinks contain calories, which will cause your body to release more adrenaline. This helps with cardiovascular endurance.

Eat healthily: Eat well in general. Choose foods with lots of protein to keep blood sugar levels stable. Focus on eating food that's low in sodium and carbs. Avoid processed foods, including breads, pasta, potato chips, white rice, candy bars, soda, sweetened beverages, and soft drinks, as these tend to be high in fat, salt, sugar, and calories.

Sleep well: Get enough sleep every night. Try to stay awake until 10 p.m., ideally sleeping eight hours each night. You also want to limit caffeine consumption to no more than three cups of coffee per day. The good news: It takes only about 30 minutes to fall asleep if you try to hit both targets.

Exercise safely: Talk to your doctor first before exercising outside. Also, avoid vigorous activity during the day, such as riding your bike. Don't run near cars or people who are drunk.

While previous studies have shown that mice bred for impaired glucose tolerance can display more aggressive behaviors than normal animals, it remains unclear whether this affects humans, or vice versa. The new study, published today (March 15) in Nature Communications, used genetic engineering to turn off an enzyme called GLUT4 that controls the body's ability to convert glucose into energy. In doing so, the researchers eliminated excess sugar from both blood and fat tissue -- effectively starving them of fuel without causing brain damage.

The modified mice exhibited decreased inflammation but gained weight with no significant changes in insulin sensitivity or cognition, the researchers reported. Their brains also contained less cells expressing the protein MMP9 that normally helps regulate cell growth and differentiation. And compared to normal control mice fed regular chow, the GLUT4 knockout mice developed significantly fewer white matter neurons, known as axons, which carry nerve impulses throughout the brain. These defects are consistent with what causes neurological symptoms associated with MS, including memory loss, weakness and difficulties walking, among others. [The 10 Most Destructive Diseases]

In addition to eliminating glucose from their diet, the GLUT4 mutant mice had an increased risk of developing autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, according to the researchers. They showed similar differences between those whose brains were infected by the Ehrlichia infection and the healthy control group, they found. And they did even worse when given medications meant to treat inflammatory conditions such as Crohn's disease, suggesting that these mutations may contribute to some forms of MS.

The findings suggest that targeting certain genes may play a role in preventing MS, said lead author Jennifer Tashiro, an assistant professor in medical genetics at McMaster University. This finding would make sense, she told Live Science. There is growing evidence linking gene regulation to development of multiple sclerosis, she added, and ""we think this could be very important because there are still many questions about why people develop MS.""

Tashiro noted, however, that more work needs to be done before any possible therapeutic targets can be identified. One potential target involves a",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-7.064117431640625,38,no_prompt,8,0.18627450980392157,412,1
gpt2-large_54,"Multiple Sclerosis is a neurological disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord. The condition occurs when the immune system attacks a part of your body called the myelin sheath, which insulates nerves and other body parts. When this happens, you experience numbness, tingling, and weakness in your muscles and legs. You may also have muscle twitches or paralysis. It's important to know what your symptoms are, so if your doctors decide to diagnose you with MS, they can assess your overall health and discuss the best treatment options. Read more about how MS diagnoses work here, and find out whether there's a screening test for MS at your hospital visit.

What causes multiple sclerosis?

Multiple sclerosis (MS) develops when the immune system misidentifies an abnormal protein in white blood cells as dangerous. This leads to inflammation of your brain and spine. Over time, the damage gets worse and eventually kills nerve fibers. People affected by MS often get several sclerosis-related diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, ulcerative colitis, psoriatic arthritis, and Lyme disease — but not everyone has them. Many people who develop MS don't develop any other conditions related to their immune systems. Most commonly, the cause of MS is autoimmune: An immune response against some part of the immune system. Learn more about how multiple sclerosis is diagnosed here. If you're concerned about your medical history or think you might be infected with a virus that can trigger a flare up of MS, see a healthcare provider right away.

How common is MS?

The Centers for Disease Control estimates that between 1% to 5% of adults in the U.S. will have MS one day in their lifetime. However, many older adults without other serious illnesses can develop MS. About 70% of all people with MS have no other chronic disease, meaning they've had no signs of MS since birth.

In 2010, about 17 million Americans were living with MS. In 2016, about 3 million Americans had been diagnosed with MS. By 2030, the CDC predicts the number of new cases of MS will double from today's estimated 2 million to 7 million.

Who is most likely to develop MS?

There are three main risk factors for developing MS. These are genetics, environmental exposure, and lifestyle choices.

Genetics

People born after 1946 or before 1965 have a higher than average risk of MS. Genetically speaking, those who are carriers of the BHL",54,What does multiple sclerosis diagnosis include? What does it change?,-0.176021546125412,44,no_prompt,8,0.17886178861788618,404,11

Depression, defined as a severe low mood with loss of interest and pleasure in life, affects approximately 6% of adults worldwide.1-2 It's one of the world's leading causes of disability and death.3 The most common forms of depression include:4

Major depressive disorder (MDD): A milder version of major depression with diminished sense of well being and guilt, feelings of hopelessness, lack of motivation, irritability, worry, sleep difficulties, lack of energy, inability to concentrate, poor memory, or difficulty concentrating.5

Anxiety disorders: These include panic attacks, phobias (fear of needles or other objects), social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).6 Social phobia includes fears associated with public speaking, speaking in front of others, and wearing certain kinds of clothing.7 Anxiety disorders cause intense distress that interferes with daily activities.8

Obsessive compulsive disorder: An extreme form of anxiety disorder characterized by chronic, irrational thoughts about losing control over behaviors such as checking oneself into and out of bed, having an ""unwanted"" thought, or worrying excessively about situations that are not real but seem to involve danger.9 Obsessions or compulsions may be related to fear of harming yourself or others.10 OCD is considered to be one of the more common types of anxiety disorder and many people who have it have coexisting conditions such as bipolar disorder, substance abuse, and eating disorders.11


Aspirin increases your risk for developing depression.12 Aspirin also lowers the concentration of serotonin, which is important in regulating mood and behavior.13 In addition, aspirin blocks the action of the enzyme CYP 3A4. This means the body cannot use its own natural production of this neurotransmitter to produce the proper amount needed to regulate mood and behavior.14 For example, an estimated 20 percent of all Americans suffer from depression,15 and one study reported that antidepressant medications cause approximately 4 percent of patients to experience suicidal ideation.16

How do antidepressants work?


Most commonly used antidepressants are tricyclic (TCA) drugs; they help decrease levels of noradrenaline, which helps control heart rate and blood pressure, but not enough to fully relieve symptoms of depression.17 Another class of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) block the actions of another chemical known as 5HT.18 SSRI antidepressants increase levels of",52,What are the most common mental health problems?

I believe that when I use the word ""holistic"", it has to do with having an understanding on how to be more effective in terms of taking care of my body. Some people get upset if they think about this in terms of an individual's health; however, this article is primarily meant as a guide to help you understand why it may seem counterintuitive at first to take care of your physical health in the way that you want to.

The idea behind holistic medicine is simple; rather than treating diseases based upon their symptoms or symptoms alone, rather than focusing on one specific disease, holistic doctors focus solely on curing the underlying causes of any disorder. This has been proven through research by many researchers across many different disciplines – but there are still many different theories and explanations of this process, ranging from the mind-body connection, to natural healing techniques, to spiritual healing practices, to brain science. One thing that everyone agrees upon is that healing is possible, though not always desirable.

To explain this concept better, let me make a distinction between two different concepts – a disease and its symptom. I will define both before going further into each. Disease = condition that needs to be addressed within our bodies

Symptoms = conditions which occur while we have these ailments

When using the phrase ""holistic"" I am only referring to those treatments which can be taken with or without medication. If you decide to skip over pills, then I don't see why you would need to consider something like holistic medicine.

As I mentioned earlier, I feel strongly that taking advantage of the power of self-care can bring immediate positive results in a lot of areas. By creating a plan which includes you, your family, your friends, and anyone else who might benefit from treatment you can easily create a system that works.

What are the most common features of a BPD?

The most common feature is a need for and an intense desire to avoid others' reactions or even just being around them. This can be a constant struggle, with the person avoiding getting into situations where they might hurt someone else. There may be an over-reaction to a perceived threat to themselves, usually by accident, which causes feelings of anger and fear or anxiety. However, if this happens too often, it can become more severe (BPD). It could also lead to the need to punish people who harm or threaten them or other close relatives in order to feel better.


Another major symptom is a feeling of emptiness, which can be triggered when there isn't anything positive that can fill the void. One way that people cope is by creating their own fantasy worlds or stories about what life would be like were they not part of the world of ""the other."" For example, if they were separated from their parents at birth they might create a story where their mom and dad had never existed and that they were both still alive. They might develop a story of how they were adopted as children without ever knowing their biological mother or father and became completely isolated from them, having no contact with anyone but themselves. Or, if they have multiple personalities, a couple could invent a story about how one person was born to two different families and then went on to form a totally separate persona in every sense, including appearance. Another aspect of BPD is a tendency towards paranoia and suspicion, especially when faced with seemingly irrational beliefs, actions, or thoughts. People with BPD may experience a strong need for reassurance and protection from others and may be very easily upset or angry at any sign of rejection or betrayal from others, especially those who are close family members. They tend to see everything through a lens of what the person who has it is telling them; so much so that they are unable to accept or trust anyone else's version of reality, and thus can often lash out in a jealous rage against the perceived enemies within their own inner circle. They're often highly emotional, sensitive and quick to jump to conclusions, particularly when they perceive threats to their very self-esteem. Sometimes people with BPD will try to protect themselves by blaming others for everything. When it comes to relationships, they may feel threatened, guilty, or ashamed if anyone doesn't treat them with respect or makes fun of them in front of everyone. If someone does this, the person with BPD will frequently",114,borderline personality disorder symptoms,-3.875657081604004,41,no_prompt,8,0.37962962962962965,447,0

These are serious, life-altering conditions.

In the US, more than one in five people with MS have a diagnosis of CFS. In Britain, half of people diagnosed with this condition suffer from it. And those who survive the illness can become depressed or psychotic.

And now scientists at Yale University say they have found a way to help patients with both conditions – an answer that may be better than existing treatments. The researchers' findings, published today in Nature Biotechnology, suggest that by using immune cells called macrophages, which play a critical role in fighting infections and inflammation, doctors could help treat MS and CFS.

The team used stem cell technology to create mice with a genetic mutation that causes myeloid leukaemia. These mice had a mutation in two genes – one of them was thought to control how many stem cells come into the body; another gene regulates whether these stem cells make bone marrow cells. When the lab created a mouse model for MS with both myeloid leukemia and CFS, the cells developed extra stem cells in a single area of their bodies – specifically the blood vessel known as the spleen. This allowed the new stem cells to migrate into other parts of the body where they were needed.

It's not yet clear what happens when the stem cells migrate across the blood vessel. But if they do cause damage to surrounding tissue, as is suspected, the new stem cells might prevent the patient's body from making healthy blood vessels. That would mean the patient suffers from a lack of oxygen and nutrients in the bloodstream and could die, because the damaged tissue does not get replenished, according to the authors of the study.

When the scientists transplanted some of these new stem cells into mice with either MS or CFS, they saw dramatic improvements in symptoms. ""They became less infrequent,"" says coauthor John Tumas, professor of neurology and director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse's Center for Regenerative Medicine. ""Their physical function improved significantly."" They also gained weight and their skin became smoother.

That raises hope that stem cell therapy for MS and CFS could lead to effective therapies. There are currently no drugs that cure the disease, but there are several promising approaches. Some aim to reduce inflammation or stimulate regeneration by targeting the wrong receptor proteins in immune cells. Others target the faulty DNA sequences inside some lymphocytes, which helps trigger diseases such as relapsing fever.",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-9.21153736114502,125,no_prompt,8,0.6345177664974619,419,1

Have you experienced anxiety in the past or since?

Do you feel tired more often than usual? If so, do this during the day or at night when you aren't usually sleepy?

Do you notice changes in how you respond to things such as television, computers, music, or other stimuli?

It is also a chronic condition, meaning that it is very difficult for sufferers to control or stop the progression of the disease. There are many factors that can cause MS to progress, including:

Genetics. The exact cause of MS has not been determined, but research shows that genes play an important role in the development of the disease. People with certain genetic disorders may develop the disease more quickly than others do. This is called heritable susceptibility to MS. For example, if you have one gene that causes MS, then your risk increases by 1.5 times as much as someone without this particular mutation.

The program is based on the ""Tutorial"" course, with the following differences:

No classwork at the start of each lesson. Each lesson contains a discussion and demonstration of some concept, followed by practice exercises to build strength and dexterity. Each exercise has an appropriate time and duration for your level. (A typical exercise might be a short repetition of the handstand or squat stretch.) The instructor's goal is not to teach you how to do things but rather to provide you with feedback about your progress. Most of our programs are completed in 20 minutes. This includes everything from the warm-up through the class itself (i.e., it doesn't include class breaks).

Each session consists of three 10-minute segments that are spaced out over five sessions. During these 5 days, you will do various exercises such as jumping jacks, pushups, bent-over rows, weighted lunges, leg presses, dumbbell curls, etc. At the end of this five day period, students have their total number of repetitions recorded on a logbook. If you reach the prescribed number of reps within those five days, then you are successful. However, if you fail to meet the required number of reps within the allotted time frame, you are advised that it may be due to insufficient motivation or fatigue. Your coach can also review your workout tape at any time during the entire program so you know what you were doing wrong when you failed to complete certain repetitions.

Each session lasts approximately 45 minutes and includes a 15 minute break. After that interval, we'll take another 15-minute break before continuing with the next segment. If you've made it past the first 15 minutes of one segment, congratulations! You're done! But if you fall behind on the second half of a segment, you should finish the last 15 minutes of your next segment no later than 30 minutes after the end of the previous section. So don't waste too much time running around trying to catch up with the next student — make sure you spend all your precious energy on making the most of what you have learned!

The Web is no longer a place where you can find books or movies and music. Instead it's an ecosystem of interconnected networks. There are news websites, blogs and social media sites; there are video chat apps; there are even dating services. These are all inextricably linked to each other. And yet for all this connectivity, not much has changed about how we experience online communication, says Mr. Yoo, who helped found the Korea Internet Research Institute at KIISP in 2003 and is now its president. ""There are still people using Skype and Viber.""

In fact, the same technology that makes it possible for these services to connect with millions of users has also been used for decades to spy on them.

""It isn't just a new technology,"" says Mr. Yoo, who was previously director of research at Google Asia-Pacific before going into business for himself. ""It's old technology, but still very effective.""

One such tool involves equipment called ""webcams."" They are attached to the webcams of almost any device and used by hackers to remotely view what they're seeing. In 2010, an American woman named Susan Smith reported that she had been monitored while using a webcam connected to her laptop. (Ms. Smith did not respond to requests for comment.) When Ms. Smith turned off the camera in January 2011, it became available for viewing again. A few days later, it appeared as if someone had hacked into her account. It took only seconds for someone else to log onto her laptop and take a screenshot. The incident raised questions about whether companies were using camera technology—which many experts believe could be used to monitor activity on their systems—for commercial purposes.

This sort of thing happens regularly across industries, including finance, banking and energy, according to researchers like Mr. Yoo. Sometimes the cameras themselves are modified so that they secretly record conversations. Others use software to make them appear to talk on behalf of someone else—a phenomenon known as ""manipulating images."" Often, the software gets installed when people buy something online.

The researchers also found that a single dose of the drug ZMapp may have helped to stop or reverse some symptoms of MS. The drug was given to an early-stage trial volunteer with relapsing-remitting MS who had not responded to conventional anti-MS drugs so far. The patient received ZMapp at a rate of 0.5 micrograms per kilogram daily for 15 days, starting on January 20, 2016. The results were published today (March 10) in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

""We want to know if this treatment can be extended beyond 15 days,"" said senior author Daniela Rus, MD, PhD, director of the Division of Neurology Research at Lenox Hill Hospital. ""I am hopeful.""

In addition, the team looked for any differences between patients receiving ZMapp and those given placebo. Patients treated with the drug showed decreased pain intensity. In contrast, patients in the control group did not show such changes. These findings suggest that the drug may slow down neurodegeneration in certain areas of the brain associated with MS. This is important because the disease has spread to many parts of the body; it's expected that around 50 percent of people with MS will eventually develop Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease.

Researchers also analyzed the effects of the drug on the immune system, which regulates how cells in the blood react to infection by pathogens. For the first time, they examined whether using the drug affected the functioning of these immune systems—both in mice and humans. They found that ZMapp increased levels of T lymphocytes, which are part of the immune system. These cells are required for fighting off infections and inflammation. But during the same period, the level of Th17 cells fell. In other words, immune cells were less likely to recognize and destroy foreign invaders.

ZMapp isn't FDA approved yet for human use, but it could have potentially significant benefits for patients and their families. It reduces the risk of serious complications like seizures, stroke and death caused by immunosuppressive medications used to treat multiple sclerosis. However, safety concerns remain about this medication, including whether it might interfere with hormones produced by the adrenal glands. Additionally, while ZMapp increases levels of natural killer cells, there is still debate over whether high doses of the drug result in chronic inflammation that contributes to the development of diseases like arthritis and heart attacks.",92,causes of fatigue in MS,-11.416475296020508,106,no_prompt,8,0.4732142857142857,400,28

The study was led by Dr Kostas Karageorghis, of the Department of Neurology at the University Hospital of Athens Medical School in Greece.

""This is a very important first step to understanding how MS affects the brain and could be an opportunity for new treatments,"" said Dr Karageorghis, who has spent four years investigating the role of white matter pathways in MS. ""There's still much we don't know about the neurobiology and biology behind these diseases.""

Researchers looked at the brain tissue from 13 patients with MS compared to 14 healthy controls aged between 37-60. The researchers used diffusion tensor imaging and structural magnetic resonance imaging, which measures how the structure of the brain changes when tissue is moved around. MRI scans revealed that some areas of the brains were overactive in MS while others had less activity than normal or showed no difference from control regions. White matter microstructure also appeared to change.

One of the two major theories explaining what causes MS is called'spasticity'. Spasms are involuntary movements of muscles in the legs and pelvis. Some people have spasms more often, others are equally spastic. According to this theory, the nerve cells responsible for controlling muscle spasms become overactive in MS. However, a recent study suggests the opposite may be true – that if you're spastic, then your nerves can'shut off' when you get a little tired.

So far, research into whether certain proteins in the body cause MS has focused on proteins found on the surface of neurons, but this isn't as precise. For example, they might not show up correctly in MRI studies. Scientists hope to develop tools such as antibodies to detect specific proteins that might make MS worse.

While the team's work is limited to looking at one particular type of white matter, other scientists have been interested in looking at how different parts of the brain relate to each other. A second trial of MRI scans on the same group of patients will look specifically at connections between grey matter and white matter. This might reveal differences in the way that different types of white matter help connect parts of the brain together and also provide clues as to why many people with MS experience symptoms like headaches and fatigue.

Dr Karageorghis explained: ""We really need to understand this phenomenon in detail because it is one of the most fundamental mechanisms underlying all neurologic disorders – and there is so much we do not",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-9.887768745422363,96,no_prompt,8,0.7218045112781954,416,0
gpt2-large_93,"The answer is yes. And no, it isn't all about the brain or how we sleep.

While our bodies are not always at their peak physical condition, they can be more sensitive than ever before, says a new study by researchers from the University of Minnesota. They found that the amount of time each person spends awake increases with age. Sleep deprivation decreases an individual's ability to learn as well as their reaction times — two measures used to predict future behavior. The researchers also reported that ""over time, individuals who were unable to maintain adequate levels of alertness experienced greater decline in cognitive performance.""

The team studied more than 1,100 adults between the ages of 50 and 81. Participants completed questionnaires and underwent neuropsychological tests while wearing sleep-monitoring devices during daytime hours. Researchers determined the participants' sleep quality using three different metrics: total sleep time, average sleep duration (or REM) and number of awakenings per night.

Participants with the highest scores on a measure called the NREM/NREM ratio tended to be younger, had lower resting heart rates and fewer episodes of wakefulness. Individuals with higher ratios slept less efficiently but were able to retain information better, suggesting less memory loss. Those with the lowest ratios slept longer, stayed up longer and remembered less information over the course of the day compared to those with high NREM/NREM ratios. Those who slept poorly also showed signs of impaired memory function such as difficulty remembering things and losing focus when asked to recall them later.

""These results suggest that even though some of us have a natural biological clock, other aspects of sleep may play a role in regulating this biological clock,"" said senior author Paul Saperstein, M.D., Ph.D., director of Mayo Clinic's Division of Neuroscience Research.

If you and your spouse (and any children that you are raising together) qualify for the SSA's program, then you may be able to share the amount of SSI that would otherwise go to your child. It is important to note that if a parent has been receiving disability benefits under an old SSDI program that was no longer available due to changes in the law or because they have had a change in income, they cannot now get their benefits through the new SSA-approved program. Therefore, it will not count toward the maximum amount allowed when calculating the cost-of-living adjustment. In order to receive a benefit, a person must meet the eligibility criteria set forth by the SSA in each state. This means that once a person's eligibility for SSI has been determined, they can only make payments into the state-subsidized SSSI program up until their next payment into the SSSI programs. After this point, people with SSI will continue to be eligible for the federally funded SSDI program. Individuals who received both federal and state aid after July 1, 2010 are also still entitled to federal SSDI and SSI benefits but they should consult their Social Security office about applying for additional Federal assistance while awaiting determination on their application.

You will begin losing benefits upon leaving your current state and should contact your agency before you depart to confirm whether you will be eligible for new benefits.

RESULTS:

The median age was 47 years (range, 18 to 84), and 95% of participants were female. All patients received at least one dose of CPP during the first year of treatment, and 92% completed their clinical course at 1 year.

Stretching Tip #3 – Stretch Your Back

This is another stretch that's recommended in many yoga books and magazines. Just like stretching your shoulders or arms, this stretch helps prevent injury. While I'm usually against doing any type of muscle-strengthening exercise before my yoga class, there are times when such activities have benefit. So, if you've been practicing for years without any problems and want to enhance your flexibility and strengthen your core strength, then stretch your back!

Just as we did above with our upper back and shoulders stretches, here's how to use an ice pack, teddy bear or foam roller to assist your body in moving through these stretches.

How To Do A Back Stretches In Yoga Class (video)

For those who don't already know what to do when practicing yoga, here are some steps you should follow while exercising in a class setting. This process includes all types of exercises from sitting up straight with your feet firmly planted. As you move around, keep your hands out at arm's length, and try not to move them too much. Try to stay in neutral position, or even neutral alignment. Don't let yourself be pulled forward or backward. When you feel an ache or discomfort in your lower back, don't stop, and ask yourself, ""Am I going to move?"" If you're able to stay in this position throughout the rest of the class, then it means you're making progress.

When performing back stretches, pay attention to how far you can extend your arms and legs without getting soreness or tightness in your calves. Remember that even though your body may look tight, that doesn't mean anything bad has happened. Just like your shoulders and arms can come into tension and cause pain, so can your lower back, thighs and calves.

A good way to determine where to begin and end a stretch is to start with your back, then work your way down. You'll find that beginning by working your way up makes it easier to finish, but starting at a different angle creates variety and a challenge.

The doctors gave up hope that they would be able to find a cure soon, so the family decided to seek help from an unlikely source: former president Bill Clinton. The Clintons had recently traveled to India and Pakistan during the AIDS crisis there, and Hillary was impressed with their work in those countries as first lady and secretary of state. So when she learned about Dr. Bishara's condition, her husband offered $100,000 toward his treatment.

""I knew Bill Clinton personally,"" said Bishara. ""And I was struck by how much he cared."" At this point, a month after leaving office, Clinton donated nearly $15 million to fight the HIV virus.

But just because the money was coming from the White House didn't mean it wasn't complicated. When Clinton's wife was busy campaigning for the presidency, she couldn't take the time to visit her doctor every day. And because her illness left her unable to work full-time, her expenses continued to grow. In 1994, before Bishara arrived at New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, her medical bills totaled over $20,000 — more than three times what they were when she'd last been diagnosed.

She still needed help, and for that reason, Bishara sought out a new team of physicians who worked with the Clinton Foundation. One of them, Dr. Jeffrey M. Kleinman, is credited with helping Bishara get well. Since then, though, Bishara has become one of America's most successful AIDS activists. His latest project: building the largest AIDS clinic on earth.

Sitting outside the center where he works, surrounded by bright lights and flashing LEDs, Dr. Bishara shows me around his vast facility, which contains 17 operating rooms, 30 diagnostic lab tables, 15 laboratories, and nine computer labs. The room houses everything from blood test kits to microscopes to X-ray machines. There are also four massive white tables filled with samples of tissue samples taken from patients across the world; these are used for testing and monitoring. But the biggest draw is the 24-foot high ceiling above our heads, which provides a 360 degree view of the area, all lit up by LED lights.

There are many different ways that people can do this, such as determining how many calories are in foods or estimating their protein content from laboratory studies. Another method is to determine nutrient density by analyzing individual food components, which was particularly useful when trying to develop an ideal diet based on data from clinical trials. When determining macronutrient ratios, researchers have been able to obtain results similar to those obtained with laboratory studies. For example, people in one study were given either 15% fat or 20% carbohydrate as their daily energy intake, while another group received 10% fat or 30% carbohydrate. After four weeks of eating the same number of calories and fat grams per day, participants who had received a lower amount of carbohydrates showed more pronounced weight loss than those given a higher carb intake. In addition, some scientists believe that high-fat diets may cause problems with insulin metabolism.

In addition to the quantity of macronutrients consumed, there are also other factors that influence how much weight we gain: dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals, and exercise are all important. Eating too little fiber can lead to constipation, while excessive consumption of some minerals has led to mineral deficiencies. Certain nutrients can be difficult to absorb in certain foods. An excess intake of a vitamin K-rich food like kidney beans could reduce absorption of the antioxidant vitamin B6. Some scientists think that eating lots of vegetables might help prevent weight gain. As for exercising, an increased number of steps taken during a workout can increase blood flow to muscles; so if you're overweight you should aim to take at least 25 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity each week, preferably three times a week.",96,most efficient and sustainable diets,-11.40725803375244,23,no_prompt,8,0.25555555555555554,305,4

In general, newborns should be monitored closely for dehydration and other complications that may occur during birth. During labor, the baby will receive fluids through a vaginal douche in which a solution containing a large amount of water is delivered with each contraction. If this isn't possible, a nasogastric tube should be placed into the infant's mouth until delivery to deliver liquids.

Why do doctors sometimes recommend a medication called nifedipine after birth?

Nifedipine has been found effective in treating severe sepsis in infants who have not received standard antibiotic therapy. However, it may cause adverse reactions when used as part of an otherwise adequate course of antibiotics such as amoxicillin, cefazolin, or clindamycin. It is also metabolized by the liver rapidly, leading to increased toxicity. This means that while nifedipine does offer protection against severe sepsis in newborns, there is no evidence that nifedipine itself offers any benefit over other types of antibiotics. A recent study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the oral tablet nifedipine (nifedipine hydrochloride) given in conjunction with conventional treatment during pregnancy. The authors concluded, ""After 3 days of treatment, there were no significant differences in mortality rates between patients treated with nifedipine and those receiving placebo."" When considering whether to use nifedipine during labor, it is important to note that nifedipine is only recommended if both mother and child have had previous exposure to this drug.

But with growing concern over autism rates in the U.S., some experts say the debate should be framed more broadly so people can make informed decisions about vaccinations when there are new studies suggesting safety risks.

""There is no evidence, and I don't think anybody has studied this very well, that these are safe, they're effective, or that their side effects aren't going to be significant in most cases,"" said Dr. David Gorski, chairman of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine. ""So my feeling is there are still questions, especially regarding whether (vaccines) do cause harm.""

A recent study published in Pediatrics suggested the measles vaccine may increase the risk of autism among infants, although a follow-up analysis by the same researchers found no link between the two diseases.

In a separate article published Thursday in the journal Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, Dr. Robert Siegel, a professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn., said he was convinced that there were no links between vaccines and autism. He said he examined dozens of scientific reports on vaccination and found only one paper suggesting a connection with autism.

Dr. Andrew Wakefield, a British gastroenterologist who once led the controversial research linking MMR with autism, was convicted last year of fraud charges related to his work at a clinic in northern England that routinely treated children with the MMR vaccine before it could be approved by regulators for use in older children. The trial ended in November when he admitted making up data in order to support his theory, a defense based largely on the belief that childhood infections often trigger autism, but never presented as evidence in court. His lawyer argued that Wakefield had done nothing wrong because his results came from a small number of children and were not statistically significant enough to warrant prosecution.

Wakefield also used his clinic to treat parents whose autistic children refused to go home after receiving the MMR vaccine. In 2008, those patients sued the clinic, alleging negligence, saying Wakefield failed to warn them about possible complications of the vaccine during clinical trials. The case has yet to reach a conclusion.

gpt2-large_118,", it is important to note that the incidence of the disease was reduced by approximately 50% in women receiving a single course of adjuvant chemotherapy. The authors concluded that this benefit may have been due to the combination of multiple different drug classes and/or the use of high-dose adjuvants.

In addition to finding promising results with both chemotherapy drugs alone and combined treatments, many studies suggest that the use of adjuvant agents can be beneficial for patients who are unresponsive or resistant to standard therapies, especially for patients whose illness is advanced (e.g., those on dialysis). Some evidence suggests that adjuvant therapy has more favorable effects than standard therapy in these patient groups [11], [12]. However, despite the encouraging results from preclinical research, there remains much debate over the optimal dosage regimen for adjuvant therapy (see [7] below) [13]. There also continues to be considerable controversy regarding which types of adjuvant agents are most effective as compared to standard chemotherapy [14]–[16]. Thus far, the only study to address the issue directly came out of China, where researchers used a 5-drug regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide followed by doxorubicin, valacyclovir, and ritonavir, and found that doxorubicin did not reduce survival time [17]. Other recent trials using an 8-drug combination found that the combination of atazanavir and fluvastatin had no effect on mortality [18], and another trial using a similar regimen and a novel combination of doxycycline with albendazole found no difference between two regimens [19]. While some investigators have reported improved survival with 6-drug combinations, others have shown mixed results; indeed, several studies have indicated either no significant improvement in overall survival or even worse outcomes when comparing standard and 6-drug regimens [20], [21]; however, the authors noted that this was because one group was taking 4 different drugs simultaneously and another group was taking 2 or fewer drugs. This pattern seems inconsistent with some prior data indicating that 6-drug regimens generally perform better than 3-drugs regimens on average [22]. Nevertheless, the majority of researchers agree that the effectiveness of adjuvant treatment depends on the type of agent used, including whether it is in combination with other drugs or is administered alone [23], [24], [25].

Q: What's the difference between an MS diagnosis and ""autism""?

A. An MS diagnosis means that someone has been diagnosed with the most common form of the disease — called rheumatoid arthritis. Most people with MS who develop autism have neither type of arthritis. The term ""Autism"" refers to a group of symptoms including social communication difficulties, repetitive behaviors and repetitive thoughts, and difficulty in making decisions. This disorder can range from mild (as it does for many people) to severe (as it does in Autism Spectrum Disorders) and can be life threatening if left untreated. People with autism are more likely than others to exhibit behavior problems, which include excessive fussiness, tantrums, self-injurious tendencies, aggression toward adults or animals, and other inappropriate behaviors such as reckless driving. In addition, they often display impaired fine motor skills and poor coordination on tasks requiring fine movement. Children often have autism early in their lives and usually begin showing these signs at around age 2 or 3. Their behavior may appear less acceptable in some families due to their unusual developmental profile and sometimes may not be seen until later in childhood. They typically don't speak until around ages 4 or 5, but they can start talking by age 6 and continue to communicate with words through language development.",81,Can I work and study full-time with multiple sclerosis?,-4.551670074462891,7,no_prompt,9,0.0319634703196347,259,16
gpt2-large_77,"The two most important features of MS are the onset and severity. The onset is usually gradual, but sometimes it can be sudden. It typically begins between the ages of 40 and 70. Most women experience MS at some point in their lives; however, it may occur later or earlier in life than the typical woman. In one study conducted among individuals who had undergone surgery for MS, 60 percent said they experienced an early onset, while 20 percent reported having a delayed onset [1].

Many people find that MS symptoms begin during pregnancy. Some studies have found that a significant portion of patients with MS were pregnant when first diagnosed. The cause remains unknown, though some speculate it is due to changes in hormones during pregnancy such as increasing levels of progesterone [2], increasing estrogen [3] or decreased estrogen levels related to increased uterine function. More research on this question is needed. However, recent evidence suggests that the timing of the onset of MS during pregnancy could affect both the extent and severity of the disease.

MS symptoms change over time. Symptoms often increase from day-to-day to week-to-week depending upon exposure to environmental factors like stressors or lifestyle factors, such as diet. Additionally, the more severe the disease the longer it takes for symptoms to improve. It has been suggested that hormonal changes caused by the menstrual cycle (which occurs naturally in humans) may play a role in contributing to the development of MS. There are also other possible influences such as genetic predisposition, genetics, gender, and even birth order.

In this paper, she covers two important areas which may be particularly relevant to our present time: the biological basis of chronic disease such as diabetes or hypertension and the social consequences of chronic disease (i.e., obesity). She also outlines how people can make lifestyle changes that will reduce their chances of developing chronic health problems and how social interventions can help prevent these from occurring.

Shevchenko discusses studies that seek to measure the number of individuals with different types of chronic diseases and how they relate to each other. In particular, her work focuses on the relationship between the incidence and prevalence of various conditions, such as heart disease and cancer, and the incidence and distribution of people who meet or exceed criteria for those conditions. Her review highlights findings that indicate that chronic disease does not just affect the general population but also takes many forms, including: mental illness, physical illnesses like diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, etc.; cardiovascular disease (including coronary artery disease), stroke, high blood pressure, and kidney disease; and infectious diseases.

If you're feeling lucky, take a look at the following list of top 15 reasons to wear dentures:

Dentures provide peace of mind for many adults and help them keep their teeth in good condition. They are one of the most popular dental care items on the market today.

The best way to know if your dentist is offering a discount or special deal on denture pricing? Look at the bottom of their website and see what they offer. If it's not there, chances are that they haven't received any offers from anyone else yet, so feel free to ask. It's always possible that their discount/special deal may be over-priced for you. Don't worry though – we'll give you an idea how much it could cost you before you even begin searching. Here is the top 15 ways to save money on your first round of treatment:

1. Get Your Price Reduced With Discounted Dental Insurance Companies

One option that people often turn to when they want to purchase new dental appliances is the dental insurance industry. When you choose to use these companies, which are typically independent entities that have been around for decades, there is usually some form of discounts or discounts as well. This ensures that you're getting the exact same type of service at lower prices. There are numerous dental plans available on this web site, including:

2. Ask Your Dentist About Free Shipping & More

If you really want to save a bundle on your dental appliance shopping, make sure you ask about free shipping and other discounted benefits offered by your local dental practice. You might be able to snag a great deal on the very latest dental device by asking your doctor, nurse practitioner, pharmacist or dentist whether they offer free expedited shipping services on orders made with dental equipment or implants.

3. Make Sure Your Plans Include Inpatient Care And Outpatient Care

Whether you need a crown, root canal, extractions or anything else you can think of, your local dentist has a variety of options to meet your needs. He or she will likely have multiple options available in order to accommodate every person that comes through his or her door! However, most patients prefer to avoid having a long waiting time while they get care, because they don't want to miss out on a day off work or attending a family event. If you decide that you'd like to keep those appointments as close to home as possible, it's always worth considering that your dentist may opt to schedule some outpatient appointments",105,wisdom tooth cuts gum pain,-13.061516761779783,73,no_prompt,9,0.9240506329113924,432,0

Diabetes affects your blood sugar levels, and can cause damage to organs such as kidneys, heart and brain; however, it's not always easy or possible to control. It is essential to take steps every day to manage your condition (and prevent future complications), so that you get on top of all your symptoms as quickly as possible. A healthy diet will help manage your health issues, because it contains many nutrients which aid in regulating your body's glucose production, reducing insulin resistance, improving digestion, and keeping blood sugar levels steady.

You are unlikely to have any problems managing your diabetes if you follow these guidelines: eat naturally-occurring foods

don't overindulge in high calorie products – try moderation when eating out – see our article about healthy food choices

use diuretics regularly

eat a healthy balanced diet – this means avoiding sweets, processed foods, sugars, fried/white/pasta types of meals and snacks

follow a simple daily routine of regular physical activity

check your weight and keep track of how much you weigh each week

try taking a blood test once per month to measure your levels of fasting triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride levels, including total cholesterol – as these are important factors in determining type 2 diabetes (diabetics with normal LDL-C should not be concerned). The most effective form of treatment for people with Type 2 diabetes is usually metformin, a medication prescribed by a doctor who uses a specialised injection, which stops insulin being produced. If you're under 12 months old, the UK National Institute for Health Research recommends starting treatment at the age of two, but you can continue without treatment until 18 months old if your GP agrees. Other treatments include oral hypoglycaemic agents, intravenous beta blockers, glimepiride and phenytoin. Check your medicine label before using them. Read more about diabetic management here.

Researchers conducted a study to determine the effects of exercise on heart disease mortality, comparing men and women who had been healthy for at least one year with those who were not healthy. The results showed that participants in the physical fitness intervention group experienced better survival than their counterparts in the control group, compared with both women and men in the other groups. They also found that participants who completed all the activities of daily living (ADLs) were more likely to live longer than those in the control group. This suggests that this type of training may help prevent or slow the progression of cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks, strokes and heart failure.

What are the research findings?

The researchers analyzed data from 3,731 adult male subjects participating in an eight-year follow-up study, which was conducted by the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine between 1999 and 2004. Participants took part in a variety of clinical trials; some included physical fitness trials, others did not. The participants received general medical care, including regular checkups and blood pressure screenings. Each participant was followed until age 80, when he or she died. In total, 459 individuals died during the study period. Of these deaths, 137 occurred among adults who participated in the physical fitness interventions. Of the remaining cases, 618 people were diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. The average age of death among participants in the physical fitness intervention group was 71 years, while those who did not participate in the intervention died at a younger age than those who did. Those who met criteria for either hypertension or dyslipidemia lived an extra five years than those without these conditions.

Overall, mortality rates decreased significantly among the participants who engaged in moderate intensity aerobic physical activity, particularly among older participants. Individuals who exercised regularly experienced the greatest reduction in risk of dying prematurely, but even moderate exercise increased the odds of surviving. The authors conclude that there is strong evidence linking physical activity to improved health and longevity.

I would never consider myself as an ""expert"" when it comes to the subject of this blog, but the fact that I've been writing on and off about this topic for several years now shows just how much knowledge there is out there. It's even easier to understand if you think about it this way: it has nothing to do with what I know. I simply want to share what I have learned with others in order to help them better understand their own issues with myalgic encephalomyelitis (EAE) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).

Myself and many others are very open-minded people who believe that everyone can be helped by understanding what causes EAE or CFS. However, there is a certain level of commonality between those two conditions that is often overlooked by both patients and researchers alike. These same factors must also be considered when deciding which treatments are best suited to each patient, especially if they are receiving multiple medications at different times. This article aims to give readers a general overview of the various medical options available in treating these two conditions.

The Symptoms of EAE and CFS

It may seem like EAE and CFS are pretty similar, but that isn't always the case. While there is no single set of symptoms related to EAE or CFS that all patients will experience, they are both characterized by a severe inability to function. The exact cause(s) of this lack of activity remains unknown but research suggests that some key structural changes occur within specific areas of your brain known as the thalamus, cingulate cortex, and basal ganglia. They're not the only area where these alterations take place but they play a significant role in determining whether or not someone experiences EAE or CFS. Other than having difficulty staying awake while maintaining consciousness, most sufferers report extreme weakness and exhaustion along with fatigue. As far as possible causes go, one theory posits that these problems arise because of the overactive central nervous system and excess levels of stress hormones such as cortisol.

What Causes Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?

While EAE and CFS may appear similarly, they actually differ significantly in their underlying cause(s), causing patients to suffer from these disorders at completely different stages of development. Here's why. The cause(s) of EAE and CFS are still largely unknown although the underlying structure of the brains of children and adults with these conditions are fairly",121,numb fingers arthritis,-13.978992462158203,177,no_prompt,9,0.9943820224719101,417,0

These tiny hairs act as ""glue"" to keep the eyelid lid closed during sleep. In many cases, when people become sleepy or feel nauseous, the outer eyelid closes automatically to keep their eyes closed, preventing them from being smothered by heavy, sticky mucus.

One way this happens is if someone's own immune system (called the ""Th1"") attacks the brain tissue of the inner eyelid. This leads to inflammation that tears out the hair, but sometimes it can be prevented with surgery.",132,headpats scalp psoriasis,-13.448535919189451,124,no_prompt,9,0.992,111,0

How can you tell if someone has MS?

The first sign of MS is an excruciating pain in one or both legs or arms. It's very similar to having your leg blown off and being on crutches while walking. The other signs include numbness and tingling (tenderness) around the hands and feet, along with fatigue, headaches, depression and muscle stiffness. Your brain may also show problems (such as difficulty concentrating or memory loss).

Can you tell if someone else has MS?

If you think someone is taking drugs that affect your immune system or they have been diagnosed with MS before, ask them questions about their mental status, such as:

Do they feel tired all the time?

Are they sleepy all the time? Are there times when they're awake but have no energy?

Does anyone else seem tired all the time?

Have they developed more serious symptoms?

Is there something odd about how they talk lately? If you notice anything out of the ordinary, call your doctor right away.

It's important to note that these signs aren't always indicative of MS. Sometimes people just want to lie down and pass out during the night because they're afraid of the dark. And some people experience mild cognitive impairment.

There is also the fact that most of the time these organisms have little to no effect on us other than causing a mild rash or itching.

But what happens when a child who has eczema develops a serious allergy? I am not going to pretend that there isn't an allergic reaction taking place at this point. It may be the case that the bacteria that reside in your digestive tract are invading and infiltrating various parts of the body through the skin. In this situation, the immune system responds by attacking the microorganisms and eventually killing them off. The immune system often times goes into overdrive, attacking everything inside and outside of the body to help fight off infections. This can mean the destruction of the intestinal lining, and sometimes even death. These reactions occur very rarely, but they are extremely unpleasant experiences for anyone who suffers from eczema. They do not happen infrequently enough to justify any kind of medical treatment. If you're lucky enough to avoid the effects of such a reaction, there is hope. You'll want to make sure that you don't have too many microbes in your intestines because if you do, then you are likely to develop an autoimmune disease which will cause inflammation in the colon and intestinal wall (a problem known as Crohn's disease). If this happens you will need to find ways to eliminate these unwanted invaders before you suffer further damage.


The good news about eczema is that there are treatments that are available now that might offer relief from a significant portion of the symptoms. Some common types of antibiotics that can treat allergies include fluoroquinolones like metronidazole (an antibiotic used for wound healing), erythromycin (used to treat chronic sinusitis) and ciprofloxacin (used for treating urinary tract infection).

There are also drugs called immunosuppressants that act like steroids, decreasing inflammation and reducing swelling and pain. These drugs are available in capsules that are taken orally, injectable, or via injection under the skin. They work by blocking production of histamine, which causes itchiness and allergic reactions. Other immunosuppressant medications include steroidal antihistamines like acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and carbamazepine (Tegretol®). Both of these drugs are used to treat asthma and allergies",102,randomly gotten eczema,-7.9957098960876465,45,no_prompt,9,0.45918367346938777,401,2

What is autoimmune disease?

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other similar conditions may involve an imbalance between your immune system's defences against invading pathogens like bacteria or viruses – called ""autoimmunity"" – and its ability to recognise and destroy these invaders. This imbalance means your body tends to attack itself instead of the infection, even if it isn't the actual source. For some people, this results in a number of symptoms such as: difficulty swallowing or speaking; difficulty breathing, dizziness or shortness of breath; changes in mood or concentration.

In most cases, though, the balance is restored by proper medication. Some people develop severe auto-immune disorders such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and HIV/AIDS after they have had their bodies attacked by foreign organisms. Others may suffer from milder forms that interfere with normal health, such as psoriasis. The majority of patients with ASD are diagnosed by doctors based on clinical examination, but there are also other types of diagnosis, such as those made using genetic testing.

How do I get better? What if it doesn't happen overnight?

The way your body responds to treatment depends heavily on how quickly you respond to medications and how well the drugs work. It takes weeks to months for the drugs to begin working properly, so taking them regularly will help ensure that you stay better longer than people who take them every day. If treatment does not improve within three months, talk to your doctor about changing or stopping your medicines.

If you cannot tolerate your current treatments, it might be time to consider a different approach. There is good evidence that giving immunotherapy injections, intravenous (IV) therapy, oral drugs, vitamins or herbal supplements may help. But there are risks involved too. These include:

a risk of developing an allergy

an increased risk of infections

the possibility of being more likely to relapse to the same condition

reversible side effects including bone loss, kidney damage and problems with blood sugar control.

A range of other measures can also be taken to slow down your recovery. Talk to your GP if you're unsure whether any of these measures might suit you.

It is a progressive form of neurological impairment with no cure, and one that's increasingly common in the United States as more people turn to alternative treatments for their chronic conditions such as arthritis or depression.

At the time the study was conducted, there were about 7,000 new cases of MS reported each year across North America, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS). Now we're at about 25,500 annual diagnoses. ""This is really quite significant,"" says NMSS Director Dr. John Finkkeller, who led the team studying how smoking causes MS in mice and found that exposure to secondhand smoke increased the risk of developing the disease by 70 percent. In fact, a recent study published in Nature Medicine indicated that smoking may be even worse than previously thought. It found that smokers have more advanced stages of MS than non-smokers.

""There are still many unknowns around this phenomenon,"" he explains, but it's clear that the link between smoking and MS has been going on for some time now—in addition to the decades-long decline in the prevalence of MS among Americans over 40. And it seems likely that other factors play a role as well: Researchers are beginning to explore the possibility that early brain development might also contribute to MS. Another potential explanation is that smoking damages the immune cells lining the blood vessels supplying the brain, causing them to become less efficient at fighting off infections. The immune response plays out differently in different parts of the body; in particular, when your immune system encounters a foreign invader such as HIV or another viral infection, it sends its first shots right into the nerve endings that connect nerve cells to other cells. As these nerves become damaged, they stop functioning normally, resulting in the symptoms often referred to as MS. While the precise mechanisms behind the process aren't completely understood yet, scientists suspect that the buildup of inflammatory cytokines in the central nervous system contributes to the inflammation seen in MS, which can lead to cognitive problems, headaches and other symptoms.

The current results don't necessarily mean smoking causes MS. But it does suggest that the disease will continue to increase as years go by without a cure. ""We need to do a better job of understanding what triggers a flare up in MS and identifying ways of preventing it, before we start getting patients with MS into clinical trials,"" says Finkkeller.

What is depression?

Depression is a mood disorder characterized by persistent sadness and negative thoughts. It's more commonly referred to as low-level major depressive disorder (LMDD). LMDD affects one out of every 10 people over age 18 years old, and approximately 3 percent of Americans will experience LMDD in their lifetime.1 The symptoms of LMDD may include:

feelings of worthlessness,

depressed mood,

anhedonia — feeling no pleasure from everyday activities or activities that would otherwise be enjoyable, such as watching television, eating food or doing chores, sleeping or being awake, exercising or even getting enough rest, having trouble thinking clearly, losing interest in things once they're no longer pleasurable, feeling sad when not depressed, or feeling hopeless because he/she has lost hope, and/or

feeling hopeless because he/she has lost hope, and/or feelings of hopelessness, difficulty concentrating, irritability, and increased appetite.2,3

There is also research suggesting that low moods due to depression may lead to other physical illnesses, including heart disease4 and type 2 diabetes5.6 People who suffer from LMDD usually go through a period where they may feel very anxious, but this can often be alleviated by taking certain medicines.7 However, as noted above, some individuals still continue to struggle with their feelings of depression after they stop taking medication.8

Is depression a serious problem?

Yes! Depression has been linked to several types of cancer deaths among people ages 50 and older,9 and suicide rates increase dramatically among those living with LMDD.10 Although some studies suggest that LMDD patients may fare better than non-laboratory controls on cognitive tests, many clinical trials report that LMDD patients are less likely to get diagnosed with a primary diagnosis, are less likely to take antidepressants,11 and are more frequently prescribed drugs like benzodiazepines.12 In addition, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, depression was the second leading cause of disability worldwide in 2008.13

gpt2-large_51,"What is holistic medicine?

The term ""holistic"" refers to the idea that each component of a health system can be used individually or in combination. The concept originated with John Harvey Kellogg, founder of General Mills (now known as Kellogg's), who coined the phrase after describing how cereal grains could be used together to make all sorts of tasty breakfast foods. Although many other companies have used this same approach, the first commercial formulations of such products were developed by William Selden, Jr., founder and president of Dr. Selden Nutritionals.

Today, it is widely accepted that nutrition is made up of three major types of nutrients: essential fatty acids, proteins, and carbohydrates. In addition, there are other components like minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants. Holistic medicine has its roots in the early 20th century when scientists realized that they did not understand all aspects of human metabolism. They also discovered that some dietary supplements had adverse effects on the body. These adverse effects included weight gain, rashes, insomnia, allergies, depression, and high cholesterol. They began to look at alternative forms of nutrition that would improve our bodies' ability to process food properly.

Dr. Selden created his own formula for correcting these issues. He called them ""holistic remedies."" This was a breakthrough moment. It was the birth of modern nutritional science. Over the years, Dr. Selden refined this formula until it became the most reliable form of nutrition available today. Today, he still teaches his formulas to medical students around the world.",51,What is holistic medicine and what does it include?,-0.0545649416744709,3,no_prompt,9,0.016042780748663103,250,15

Psychiatric treatment and care are important for all patients who have a history of suicide attempt or who present with suicidal thoughts. The most common treatments for depression in adults are antidepressants, psychotherapy, and behavioral therapy (Bartels et al., 1990; Schulz et al., 1991). However, medications used for treating depressive symptoms should always be carefully evaluated by a medical doctor prior to initiation or continued use. In addition to these medications, there is an increasing trend toward using psychostimulants such as methylphenidate or amphetamine. These substances may also increase risk for self-harm. Although studies suggest that both stimulant medication and alcohol consumption can contribute to suicide attempts, it is unclear whether any one substance has been shown to cause more suicidal behavior than another (Gagnon & Dolan, 1988). Finally, the role of sleep abnormalities and/or other comorbid conditions remains controversial. Studies indicate that poor quality sleep and sleep disturbance might play a significant role in several psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder (MPD), panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, and eating disorders (O'Connor, 1989; Hines & Dolan, 2000a; O'Connor & Miller, 2003). It is possible that some individuals with MDD and similar mood disorders could develop additional bipolar and psychotic symptoms as a side effect of sleeping problems, particularly if the sleep disturbances involve restless legs syndrome (RLS) or insomnia. Treatment for these conditions should include consideration of appropriate sedation, hypnotic drugs, and cognitive-behavioral therapies (e.g., CBT).

The relationship between depressive symptomatology and suicidal behaviors is complex and difficult to determine. Some studies suggest a relationship between early symptoms of depression and increased risk for future suicide attempts, while others show no correlation at all (Gagnon & Dolan, 1988; Gagnon & Alpert, 1995). Additionally, several studies found that persons suffering from depression were more likely to die by suicide in the first 3 months after their initial diagnosis (Lambert & Sperry, 1984). Further research is needed to better understand the role of specific antidepressant and antipsychotic medications on suicidal ideation and behaviors.

Although people who commit suicide often seek help before attempting suicide, they do so regardless of how severe their symptoms are. There is no way to predict whether someone will commit suicide based solely on their current state or previous life events",114,borderline personality disorder symptoms,-12.349021911621094,95,no_prompt,9,0.8796296296296297,394,5

gpt2-large_123,". The following are some of the reasons why this is such a serious problem for women:

1) A woman's thyroid gland may be overactive in an undiagnosed condition. This can lead to thyroid cancer, which is also very dangerous for women.

2) Thyroid hormones may interfere with her menstrual cycles and cause problems.

3) Low levels of thyroid hormone may decrease the effectiveness of contraception and lead to infertility.

4) Low thyroid hormone levels may result from eating too much protein or grains, especially wheat, soy, corn, or dairy products.

5) Women have lower testosterone levels than men because they do not get enough testosterone when their bodies produce it. Testosterone is necessary to make most of the body's other hormones, including estrogen and progesterone. Without adequate amounts of testosterone, your heart will stop beating and you'll become depressed and exhausted.

6) It is possible for the thyroid to go into hyperthyroidism (overproduction) instead of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism can result in low blood pressure and weight gain.

7) A woman's thyroid gland has many different parts that must work together so that she doesn't get sick as easily.

8) If a woman has untreated and does not take thyroid medication, the excess thyroid hormone produced by the disease can damage other organs in the body and cause a number of health issues.

9) Since there are no studies showing how much iodine women need on average, they don't know what level should be prescribed.

10) If you're pregnant, you might develop thyroid tumors if you use more than 10,000 IU of iodine per day.

11) Even the slightest increase in thyroid hormones causes other serious health problems for women. For example, high blood pressure can cause kidney failure or even death. And excessive thyroid activity can reduce the ability of thyroid hormones to regulate the nervous system and endocrine function. In short, high-dose iodine supplements don't improve anything except making you feel ill and tired.

12) If you're taking certain medications, like antihypertensives, thyroid drugs, or adrenal steroids, your thyroid gland may be producing more thyroid hormones than normal. That means you'll have higher blood pressures and elevated cholesterol. These drugs should always be taken at least once every 4 weeks. However, if you start taking these drugs after pregnancy, talk to your healthcare provider about switching to a thyroid drug",123,hypothyroidism symptoms,-10.1089448928833,99,no_prompt,9,0.6111111111111112,391,1

1.4. Patient can have a doctor's appointment

After obtaining all necessary approvals from your health care professional, you may request that your child receive medical treatment and/or therapy as needed. You should let your GP know about this request if you are unsure. Your child may also ask your GP to obtain a referral from another local practice or specialist in psychiatry, psychologists or social workers to see your child. This is referred to as ""medical assessment"". If your family doctor agrees to your child being treated, he or she will need to inform the mental health team at the hospital where your child has been admitted and the child's attending psychiatrist. You and your doctor will discuss treatment options together. It is important to tell your doctor about:

your age

any medications you take

the circumstances under which you feel comfortable discussing these matters with your doctor

whether you have a history of depression

anxiety or psychotic symptoms like hallucinations or delusions

the risks of taking psychiatric drugs

how long it takes to take the medication

if you want your child to continue taking psychiatric medications after treatment begins

you wish your child to speak with a psychologist or counsellor before starting treatment

the level of support your child needs during treatment

What are the benefits of treating yourself?

If you manage your own medicine and medication yourself, there are many advantages to doing so. Here are some suggestions on how to set up your own medicine-taking process:

Get help from friends, family members and others who understand your problem

Talk to someone who understands your problems and offers help and advice

Consider setting up a medicine-sharing group (online or off) for patients, family or friends

Take regular checkups and make sure things work well with your current medication

Make sure your new medication fits into your lifestyle

Know when your current medication is no longer working

Use a self-help booklet or talk to a knowledgeable friend or family member about making changes

gpt2-large_55,"The disease is not contagious. But you can pass it from person to person, through saliva or by sharing needles in a needle exchange program. Some people with MS have antibodies to the virus and may develop symptoms during pregnancy or childbirth if they do not get them early enough. This happens most often with women of childbearing age who are infected while carrying their babies.

How long does the disease last?

MS affects one in every 200 people over 50 years old, according to the CDC. About 3% to 5% of all Americans will have the disease at some point in their lives. The majority of those who develop chronic MS will never be able to work again. And fewer than 1% will ever regain full function on the job. People who experience these illnesses usually live for about 10 years after diagnosis.

What causes MS?

There are many theories about how MS develops, but most experts agree that the two main factors are: (1) immune system dysfunction caused by exposure to certain infections, like HIV/AIDS; (2) trauma.

When someone gets an infection, the body's natural defenses fight off the infection. These immune responses eventually weaken and stop working properly because too much damage has been done to the brain. It is at this point that scar tissue forms, which takes away part of the ability of the body to respond to injury. A number of other things also contribute to MS, including hormonal changes and genetics.

So what exactly triggers MS? There are two major types of MS -- primary progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PPML), which affects the central nervous system, and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPM). Both conditions affect nerve cells that control vision, movement, balance and swallowing, among others. The two types of MS are different in terms of whether their attacks involve muscle spasms, inflammation or both.

Primary progressive MS begins when there is scarring around nerves in parts of the brain that control motor functions, such as the eye and the jaw, or in areas of the brain responsible for memory and speech. Secondary progressive MS occurs when nerve cells die, leaving behind damaged nerve fibers called oligodendrocytes. When the injured fibers become inflamed, they block blood flow throughout the brain. The resulting symptoms include visual problems, loss of balance, numbness and tingling in fingers and toes, stiffness of limbs, inability to speak or swallow. Symptoms also can appear before the attack.

The researchers also analyzed the effects of physical activity on the body's ability to produce and maintain energy levels within the bloodstream, a key factor for managing chronic fatigue. In both situations, they found that moderate exercise improved the performance of people with mild or no MS by increasing the amount of blood flowing from their heart muscle to the brain. It also decreased the need for glucose (a source of fuel) by increasing its availability in the blood stream.

The research was conducted at The Rockefeller University School of Medicine in New York City and published online in Neurology this week.

Dr. Keesmaat said that he hopes his results can be used as part of the standard treatment protocol for people living with MS. He's also planning to study the effects of combining cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with folic acid supplementation on symptoms and cognition in patients at risk for developing a recurrence.

""One thing we're finding is that there are differences between the different cognitive disorders,"" Dr. Keesmaat told ABCNews.com. ""We've seen an increase in some of them over time.""

While it may seem like all those symptoms would go away if they took folic acid pills, the researchers say there are no studies showing that this happens. What's more, any kind of medication -- including aspirin -- could potentially cause problems if taken too often, which is one reason why physicians don't routinely prescribe certain medications for individuals with MS.

In other words, if you do have MS, don't take any medications unless you know exactly what the risks are. And when it comes to the most common drugs commonly prescribed for the disorder, Dr. Keesmaat says doctors should always consult their physician first before prescribing another drug.",57,multiple sclerosis stages phases,-10.936436653137209,63,no_prompt,9,0.30434782608695654,224,0

When you have Progressive Multiple Sclerosis, your immune system attacks the nerve cells that make up most of your nervous system. These attack are the trigger for a cascade of biochemical changes known as neuroinflammation. This inflammation causes symptoms including:

Fatigue

Memory loss

Blurred vision

Numbness/tingling sensation in muscles

Weakness and pain in joints

Depression

A weakened immune system increases your risk of developing more advanced forms of MS such as relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Some scientists believe that this increased risk may be due to reduced levels of TGFβ (a protein made by the immune system that stimulates the growth of new blood vessels). In RRMS, the level of TGFβ in the blood decreases, which could lead to more severe disability.

It's not clear if there is any relationship between increased levels of TGFβ and an increase in the number of relapses. However, researchers are looking into whether increasing levels of TGFβ might help explain why people with MS often have fewer first-degree relatives who also have the disease than healthy controls. Another theory suggests that certain chemicals in TGFβ can reduce the production of TNF receptor subunits that play key roles in protecting nerve cells from infection and injury.

What is anti-TGFβ therapy?

Anti-tumor drugs like Glivec have been shown to decrease levels of TGFβ in the bloodstream. While they haven't yet been proven effective at curing MS, it is possible they could provide some relief for those suffering from chronic pain caused by MS. If anti-tumor drug treatment does slow down the progression of MS, many patients will benefit. If nothing else, we can expect more research on how these anti-tumor drugs work and what effect they might have on reducing the risk of relapses and disability in MS.",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-7.075311660766602,78,no_prompt,9,0.5864661654135338,336,4
gpt2-large_93,"The role of sleep has been extensively studied with regard to the epidemiology, pathophysiology, treatment and prognosis of MS. Although there are no well-defined criteria for inclusion into studies on a given disease mechanism or condition, the most frequently used criteria are that sleep is insufficient if it occurs at less than 7 days per week. However, an adequate sleep schedule can be attained using other methods such as light exposure, activity restriction, and social activities during the day. Several research groups have reported that insomnia is more prevalent in patients with relapsing forms of MS than in those without relapses. For example, in one study by Rösti et al. (1994), a significant percentage of MS cases were found to be hypersomnolent, compared with only 9% of controls [25]. In another, similar study by Rösti et al. (2002) the number of subjects was increased from 16 to 47, and the average amount of time spent in bed decreased from 12 hours to 8 hours. Subjects who did not get sufficient sleep had an eightfold higher incidence of relapsing-remitting MS compared with those who got their usual amount of sleep. The authors concluded that the increase in sleep duration seems to be associated with the progression of the disease. In addition, Rösti et al. (2001) demonstrated that the length of absence from work due to insomnia decreases dramatically after several weeks of restlessness. This phenomenon could be related to sleep deprivation but, also possibly, to a decrease in energy expenditure, which results in a lower resting metabolic rate [26]. On the basis of these findings it is likely that many MS patients are hypersomnia sufferers. Thus, they might not necessarily seek out the help of sleep specialists, since the latter often do not recognize the disorder or diagnose it correctly. In contrast, even though the prevalence of insomnia increases in the early stages of MS, it is still very rare in later stages. It may even occur among those persons with moderate to severe MS, because insomnia tends to disappear over time; therefore, it would seem logical that all persons with MS should be hypersomnia sufferers. Moreover, these results suggest that the sleep deficit may actually reduce the risk of relapse to MS, since this process usually takes place within two years after diagnosis. Further work will need to examine whether there is a link between sleep and the course of MS and whether individuals with a high probability of relapses could benefit from being treated earlier, especially in the early stages of the disease when",93,Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?,-0.0133049739524722,2,no_prompt,9,0.010101010101010102,425,30
gpt2-large_72,"The Covid-19 vaccine is not a new therapy. In fact, it has been on the market since 1984 and was developed by Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) to treat rheumatoid arthritis. The vaccine uses recombinant human erythromycin-resistant type B pneumococcal polysaccharide in combination with recombinant streptomycin to target an enzyme that converts the vaccine's active ingredient into a harmless protein called a cytotoxic peptide. This is known as immunogenic activity, or IBA. IBA increases the body's ability to fight disease, but not necessarily reduce its severity. This makes the vaccine more effective against some types of disease than others. But this doesn't mean that the vaccine can prevent all cases of MS or that it will do so without side effects. There are still many risks associated with using any therapeutic vaccine, including serious complications such as infection, death, or immune suppression. So before trying the Covid-19 vaccine for MS, you should first consider whether there are other therapies available to help manage your illness. If you have MS, then maybe a different drug may be better suited to your situation.

What is the treatment for relapsing-remitting MS?

MS is a chronic inflammatory disorder that causes widespread disability. It can affect anyone who suffers from the condition, even if they don't remember symptoms. And because MS often starts at an early age, patients with relapses aren't always aware that their disease is worsening. While there is no cure, research indicates that medications used to treat MS may slow down or even reverse the course of the disease. Some of these drugs include:

Tigertop—an antibiotic sold under the brand name Relenza®

Antibiotics like ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and fluoroquinolones

Beta interferon for AIDS patients

Immunoglobulin G, also known as TgfG, which is given as a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medication for HIV/AIDS patients

Inhibitors like rituximab and heparin for hepatitis C

This study has several strengths: (1) it is a prospective, population-based cohort study; (2) we measured specific biomarkers and physical activity variables across the entire follow-up period; (3) we assessed dietary intakes that can be used as proxies for intake at baseline; and (4) our analysis was based on data from participants who had complete information about their exposure history. The present results should therefore be interpreted with caution because they are based on retrospective self-reported data which may be subject to recall bias or selection bias. Although these limitations are unlikely to influence our overall findings, some limitations must be acknowledged. First, although we controlled for multiple potential confounders by including them in all multivariate models and adjusting for BMI, energy intake, smoking status, alcohol consumption, exercise, family history of prostate cancer, hormone replacement therapy use, dieting, family history of colorectal cancer, age at menarche, and time since menopause, there were still potentially confounding factors that could have affected our results (e.g., genetic variation). Second, the measurement error associated with individual characteristics is likely greater than those associated with the covariates included in this analyses. Third, a number of the lifestyle exposures examined here were not typically taken into account in previous reviews and meta-analyses [25–27]. For example, most participants did not report any alcohol use during the baseline examination. Fourth, the results reported herein are subject to substantial uncertainty due to the observational nature of the study and its small sample size. Fifth, none of the covariates were adjusted statistically in our model. However, we adjusted for demographic and medical history characteristics in the model for which we had sufficient power to detect significant associations. Sixth, we conducted sensitivity analyses using different baseline values for each of the potential confounders. Most importantly, we performed these sensitivity analyses after excluding women with low levels of education or body mass index (<25 kg/m 2 ). As previously noted, such an exclusion would reduce the strength of the association between dietary intake and risk of prostate cancer by approximately half compared with the inclusion of women without high education or weight gain. Seventh, our adjustment for height does not alter the pattern of results observed. Furthermore, the estimates were only marginally attenuated after further adjustments. Finally, we did not adjust for body mass index, which would have reduced the estimated relative risks.

Dietary patterns, including changes in the proportion of saturated fat intake from animal sources, increased red meat consumption, and fruit and vegetable intakes may contribute significantly to MS risk. However, a recent review found that many studies have failed to show an association between red meat or processed meats and MS (4). The current report concludes that evidence linking dietary pattern to MS is insufficient and suggests that additional research into potential associations with other important chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, osteoarthritis, and neurodegenerative disorders should be undertaken to help inform public health policy.

Methods

Search strategy for PubMed searches was conducted using the following terms: ""red meat,"" ""processed meat,"" ""high-fat diet,"" and ""cholesterol."" We reviewed all relevant articles and excluded any article that could not meet our inclusion criteria because the study had no control group and did not address this specific issue. Our search strategy resulted in 2,637 articles retrieved by hand and screened through the reference lists of references included in the original papers to identify further publications. Of these articles, 1,834 were excluded because they did not clearly demonstrate that red meat or processed meat or their components contributed to MS risk. A total of 581 articles meeting our exclusion criteria met our eligibility criteria, and we extracted data on exposure and outcome information as described elsewhere (5). To assess for publication bias, we examined the funnel plot of each paper according to whether it reported ORs and its confidence interval (CI) (for P values), and also used Egger's test to determine if publication bias was present. All analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina).

Results

A systematic literature search yielded 30 articles, each reporting either a case–control or cohort study of MS patients and controls; 13 articles were included in this report (Table 1). Three articles compared the risks of MS among individuals who consumed at least 7 servings/day of red meat (2 RCTs). One comparison showed that those who ate more than 4 servings/week had a reduced risk of MS (OR 0.70 [95% CI 0.46–0.97]), while another found no significant difference in MS risk between those who ate at least 6 servings/week and less than 3 servings/week, although both studies reported moderate statistical heterogeneity (P =.06).

Risk factors for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are known to be related to physical activity.7 One study found that people with the lowest levels of physical activity were more likely than others to have had AMI during their life.8 In addition, people with lower baseline VO 2max may also have greater risk of having AMI when they do not engage in regular exercise.9 Moreover, women in particular appear to be at increased risk for developing AMI,10 although it is unclear if this finding applies to men.11

A recent meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference between the two approaches in terms of increasing survival after MI; however, the researchers noted that this could reflect other confounding factors such as genetic variation or comorbidities which may impact on outcome.12 However, there is some evidence that these conditions may reduce post-MI survival.13 It should also be noted that cardiovascular disease is also one of the major causes of death worldwide.14 Therefore, efforts must focus on identifying ways to increase health promotion.15

The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness of adjunctive therapy after coronary angiography for prevention of AMI among patients undergoing non-invasive diagnostic procedures. The review included all randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of adjunctive therapy after angiographically confirmed MI or cardiac surgery in reducing the incidence of AMI among patients receiving any intervention. We identified six studies from four different countries, including two RCTs, with a total of 21,082 participants in each study.16–20

We assessed the following key outcomes: (1) change from baseline values on clinical variables; (2) the proportion of patients in whom an MI diagnosis was made prior to randomization; (3) changes in all-cause mortality; (4) progression from baseline value to an intermediate outcome (incidence of an MI); (5) change in death rate; and (6) changes in all-cause mortality per year.

You'll want to ask them about the time of day when they first noticed their symptoms, how long they've been feeling ill, what medications they're taking, etc. If there's no problem with your health before the accident happened, then the doctor will know exactly what kinds of injuries you were experiencing before the accident occurred so they will feel comfortable treating you. The first step in getting treatment for this injury is to get yourself admitted to the hospital and given an exam by your general practitioner. This gives the physician access to all of your records, including your medical condition and past injuries. In addition, you should receive some sort of physical therapy session at least once every three months for up to 6 months. Your current therapist will probably have experience working with people in wheelchairs so he or she may be able to offer guidance along the way. After six months of regular exercise, you should be able to walk again without assistance, but be careful to avoid falls while exercising because they are very painful. If your back pain continues after your initial rehab period, see a doctor immediately.

Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first report of a direct relation between BMI and the risk of primary breast cancer outcome in an epidemiologic study including women who were free of other cardiovascular disease at baseline. The results demonstrated that higher body mass index was associated with increased risks for all-cause mortality, particularly for fatal cancers (primary, secondary, endometrial, and pancreatic), whereas weight loss and moderate physical activity did not increase these risks. In addition to the effect on overall cancer incidence, these data are consistent with previous observations that overweight may also be protective against primary breast cancer in postmenopausal women [12]–[14]. However, it should be noted that both associations were limited by small numbers (<100 cases) and the use of self-reported measures of obesity as well as the lack of adjustment for potential confounders such as smoking, alcohol intake, and age. Although we observed higher total cancer death rates among high versus low BMIs compared to normal weight individuals, no significant differences were found across any of the subtypes examined (Table 2). Despite this observation, we did observe a strong inverse association between BMI and risk of colon cancer mortality among men; however, there was no indication of interaction between BMI and sex. This could possibly reflect the higher prevalence of obesity among men, which has been shown to cause more frequent adenocarcinomas than colon cancer [15], or could be related to the fact that there is little evidence that obesity itself causes colorectal carcinoma. Given the substantial number of breast cancer deaths during the study period, we cannot exclude an unknown but potentially important contribution from differential exposure to chemotherapeutic agents. Although some studies have reported a dose-response relationship between obesity and decreased survival after breast cancer diagnosis [16], others have failed to find a statistically significant reduction in survival time following cancer surgery [17]; however, both studies used a conservative estimate of risk reduction based on breast surgeon experience, suggesting the possibility that residual confounding might contribute to the findings. A larger number of cancer outcomes were included in the present analysis because this is the largest population-based cohort study of type II diabetes. Moreover, it is possible that residual confounding would have prevented any beneficial effects attributable to obesity. Indeed, the greater absolute risk for pancreatic cancer among those with a high BMI suggests a lower likelihood of developing insulin resistance or developing diabetes and/or being metabolically healthy if the obese individual had not already developed the disease. It is difficult to separate these factors, however, since they",117,stage 4 metastatic lung cancer outcome,-12.941747665405272,187,no_prompt,9,0.7540322580645161,426,12

In addition to the above points, the following list of points are worth stressing:

There is no evidence to support the claim that any individual needs to follow a specific dietary pattern for optimal health; on the contrary, there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that it's not possible to make informed decisions about diet based solely on health outcomes. This applies not only in terms of our current understanding of nutrition but also to the way we're currently treating epidemiological studies. For example, a recent meta-analysis published in Annals of Internal Medicine found that although weight loss is associated with an improved body composition, people with more than 8% body fat had lower levels of HDL cholesterol (the ""good"" type) compared with those who were underweight or normal weight [15]. In fact, if you compare the metabolic outcomes between overweight or obese individuals with lower BMI, those without metabolic syndrome will often be less metabolically healthy, even though their obesity itself was not caused by these conditions. It should come as little surprise that such research has been replicated elsewhere [16]. Although there are many factors at play in the development of diabetes, one of the major contributors to this disease involves increased insulin resistance, which may contribute to atherosclerosis [17]. If you look at the overall health profile of someone whose blood glucose exceeds 130 mg/dl (9.3 mmol/L), the chances are that they have metabolic syndrome rather than simply being overweight. A few other factors that could potentially contribute to metabolic dysfunction include a low intake of protein, high-fat dairy products and red meat [18]. The relationship between energy balance and cardiovascular disease is complex and varies greatly between populations and types of food consumed [19], so it is very difficult to draw any conclusions about what particular foods might be harmful or beneficial. Indeed, the American Heart Association has stated that ""dietary guidelines need to reflect the complexity of this issue [heart disease] when considering the potential effects of various dietary interventions."" [20] While all aspects of human metabolism are responsible for creating the 'energy imbalance' referred to by proponents, the key factor here is the degree to which the amount of energy available for the body depends upon the state of the individual. With regard to weight gain, the mechanisms involved are as varied as they are different. One of the strongest suggestions that can be made is that we have two separate pathways that lead to excessive fat accumulation. Both mechanisms involve insulin resistance and lipoprotein(a) deposition, and both require physical activity.",96,most efficient and sustainable diets,-12.407159805297852,44,no_prompt,9,0.4888888888888889,432,6

The American Psychological Association defines therapy as ""a systematic approach to improving functioning."" It's important to note that in order to qualify as therapy, one must prove that the therapist met certain criteria: A) The patient had been previously evaluated and treated for a mental illness or condition; B) There was an understanding between the patient and therapist about the nature of the problem; C) the problems were addressed in a way that could cause lasting changes in behavior; D) the problems were understood in terms of the client's personality type rather than their physical illness, etc.; E) there were no side effects, such as withdrawal symptoms, which can occur during a brief course of treatment.

Psychotherapy is most commonly prescribed for people with serious mental illnesses or disorders (such as schizophrenia). People with borderline personality disorder need more intensive forms of counseling because they often have a difficult time coping with social situations, so psychotherapy may be needed. Therapists typically meet clients face-to-face once or twice a week with one on one sessions, usually about two hours long. This is sometimes referred to as a cognitive behavioral program, where the therapist tries to understand and change the behavior patterns of the patient through training and practice. The main goal of therapy is to find ways to improve the quality of life for patients, which may include helping them learn how to manage stress, learn self care skills, cope better with stressful events, accept criticism, avoid becoming angry, and adjust their behaviors to make the situation less harmful to themselves or others. Patients also receive peer support when necessary. For example, some patients may need to get help from friends and family. Psychotherapies tend to be effective for all types of mental illnesses, and for some mental illnesses they are even more successful.

Psychotherapy helps reduce anxiety, enhance psychological well being, and improve relationships within the therapeutic relationship. Some research shows that psychotherapy can reduce anxiety, increase positive emotions, and decrease depression.

Types of Therapy

There are three primary types of therapy available today. Therapy can focus primarily on treating a specific issue or a symptom without focusing exclusively on changing thoughts and feelings. However, many therapists feel that there are certain areas of thought processes or emotional states that should be addressed in each session.

Mild: mild intestinal symptoms such as bloating and flatulence. Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, or indigestion may be present, but they are not severe enough to require medical attention. Some people may feel better after taking laxatives with a meal if it is taken right before or after eating; however, they should also eat something sweet afterward. Mild fever can be very uncomfortable at times. The stomach should become clear within about 2 hours. If there is an infection, this will usually resolve soon after the event, although some infections continue for several days or weeks after an injury. You may experience a rash. Do not take more than one dose per day unless you have been told that it is okay because it has worked for other people who had similar problems. These events are more common with certain medications like antibiotics, antihistamines, and antihypertensives. You will probably need to drink plenty of water, especially if you are experiencing nausea or extreme thirst. Moderate: mild diarrhea lasting no longer than 3 days. There is no evidence that it causes any damage to the kidneys. It may even help the kidneys function normally. The diarrhea lasts for less than 2 hours. You may still vomit frequently while you are sick, but this depends on what you ate, how much you drank, and how long your illness lasted. It generally clears up within 24 hours. However, a few people report it not being so bad after the first week or two and then staying around for months. Most people are fine after 1 month to 6 months, although some may experience a bit of fatigue or weakness from time to time.

gpt2-large_45,"Diabetes is a chronic, progressive disease of the pancreas and blood vessels. It affects millions of people worldwide – including people who eat a balanced diet – as well as those who do not have diabetes (those with type 1 or type 2). The symptoms are often similar to many other diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. People with diabetes can develop type 3 diabetes when their insulin-producing cells become less efficient at producing the hormone needed by the body to convert sugar into energy. Type 2 diabetes begins when insulin resistance develops in the liver that produces too much insulin. Diabetes has no cure, but it can help manage some of your health problems, such as heart disease, high cholesterol levels, arthritis and certain types of cancer.

What causes diabetes?

There are several factors that contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes:

Genes

Some genes play an important role in the development of type 2 diabetes. For example, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are responsible for breast, ovarian, prostate and colon cancers. They also influence how easily cells divide (maturation) and which tissues become damaged. This means that if one gene changes, so will the others. These gene mutations may cause genetic damage to the pancreas, liver or kidney.

Nutrition and lifestyle

Obesity plays a major role in the development of type 2 diabetes. In order to control weight, you need to eat healthy foods, avoid eating foods high in fat and saturated fats, and limit alcohol intake. You should exercise regularly and keep up with physical activity, especially if you're overweight. Diet also influences this process.

Treatment for Toxoplasmosis is quite similar to the treatment for Crohn's disease; however, it can take longer to treat. The treatment regimen should include a course of antibiotics (4-6 weeks), an intake of folic acid supplements, and a strict diet with adequate protein, fat, fiber and vitamins. Additionally, if the person has multiple sclerosis, he or she may need to be treated early in order to avoid any complications from MS. If you are dealing with symptoms after using marijuana, consult your doctor about a course of immunosuppressive medications, such as Metformin or Humira.

While there is no cure for Toxoplasma infection, there are some treatments that can lessen symptoms or prevent them altogether. For instance, administering low doses of vitamin C or high amounts of magnesium will help reduce the severity of the illness. Some people also consider taking anti-allergy medication or an antidiarrheal medication called clonazepam. These measures do not necessarily mean that the patient is completely cured, but they at least decrease the frequency and duration of symptoms.

The side effects of marijuana do occur more often than many of us would like, but usually go unnoticed by most patients.

He said ""I don't know what you've been on, but you shouldn't be taking any medications at all"" – so I wasn't allowed to take anything else except a few hundred milligrams every two weeks. So I thought I'd try out a different kind of meds and they would help me. What he didn't tell me was that those were antineoplastic drugs.

That's right. They're anti-cancer drugs, designed specifically to treat cancerous tumors. You can think of them as the same thing as chemotherapy – the same chemicals are used to kill off bad cells. Unfortunately there are two major problems with this approach. First, we already know that many types of tumors contain large numbers of abnormal white blood cells called T lymphocytes. These lymphocytes can reactivate the immune system when infected (such as through infection) or by attacking healthy tissue (such as through inflammation). Second, there is increasing evidence that treating these cancers with anti-T cell therapies may actually increase their proliferation and spread even more rapidly than when they were first treated. There is also growing evidence that these treatments interfere with the body's natural healing process. Some studies show increased numbers of leukemias and other cancers spreading to nearby lymph nodes, while others indicate that there are no such changes.

The solution isn't to stop using chemotherapy altogether; rather, it has to be combined with a high dose of one of the newer anti-tumor agents, called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that target inflammatory pathways. This gives us hope that our treatment strategy, combined with existing therapies, may someday be able to give us much better results.

Cancers and other conditions can also lead to long-term loss of quality of life. A study on cancer found that, among those over 80 years old, those with a diagnosis of prostate cancer had significantly less life expectancy than men without a diagnosis. In addition, cancer patients who had been treated successfully with radiation therapy experienced greater mortality than those treated with chemotherapy. Other studies indicate that people with breast or colon cancers have longer survival after treatment compared to those who did not receive radiation. It's worth noting that cancer rates in the United States continue to rise despite efforts by various groups to improve healthcare access. More information about the link between cancer and lower health care costs is available from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in an article titled ""The Risks and Consequences of Obesity."" This report summarizes the findings of over 10 years' research conducted at NCI.


What causes obesity? How does it influence overall health and well-being? For many years, researchers have struggled with how much weight one should gain before being considered obese. There is no scientific consensus regarding this question because the majority of previous research focused only on obese people, which makes it difficult to evaluate whether these individuals actually require more calories to maintain weight than normal-weight individuals. However, new data indicates that excess body fat increases the risk of a number of medical problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney failure, atherosclerosis, stroke, osteoporosis, arthritis and even liver disease. A recent review of the evidence reveals some strong conclusions: Those who gained more than 15 pounds during adolescence or adulthood had approximately double the risks of developing coronary artery disease, hip fracture, stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, endometrial cancer and several types of noncanceric brain tumors. Additionally, overweight/obese adults are at increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, prediabetes, hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular death.

gpt2-large_35,"A: The ketogenic or low-carbohydrate diets are generally recommended for diabetic patients who have been on insulin for the long term.

Q: Do I need to restrict protein intake in order to reach and maintain weight loss?

A: No, the Ketogenic Diet is extremely effective at achieving and maintaining weight loss, while reducing overall caloric intake. There has not yet been any research that shows restricting dietary carbohydrate can lead to weight gain. However there is evidence of some weight gain when protein is restricted or even restricted to less than 30g per day, but this is only seen in obese individuals. It may also be possible to achieve higher quality protein from whole food sources such as nuts or fish if desired.

Q: Can you get fat without losing muscle mass?

A: Yes, lean muscle tissue (muscle) will still store calories for longer periods of time. While some exercise can help burn these stored calories off more quickly, it does not necessarily translate into additional body fat. If you want to lose weight, then your goals should be to increase total calorie expenditure by 5% - 10%, not just decrease calories consumed. To do this you would first need to increase the amount of energy required to perform physical activities. A good way to start doing this is by increasing the number of hours spent exercising every week. Another thing you could try is reducing physical activity during meals when eating high carb foods. Exercise will probably slow down your metabolism slightly so don't expect too much change in fat burning efficiency once you cut back on carbs. For example, if you eat a 1200 kcal meal with 500 cal/kcal of carbohydrates and 400 cal/kcal of fats, you might end up burning less than 200 calories after exercise.

Q: Will consuming large amounts of sugar make me obese?

A: This is a highly debatable topic because of different metabolic processes involved and how different foods affect each other. We know that fructose (fruit sweetener) stimulates appetite which increases hunger for both glucose and fatty acids. As an animal studies showed, high fructose corn syrup consumption leads to increased leptin production which can stimulate appetite and lead to obesity and type 2 diabetes. In humans, however, most of us experience little to no effect on our BMI despite having plenty of sweets in our diets. Instead, sugar seems to affect the brain's reward system resulting in overeating and thus obesity.",35,Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?,-0.5299979448318481,6,no_prompt,10,0.03870967741935484,410,19
gpt2-large_97,", we must also examine whether the cost-effectiveness of exercise is worth its many costs. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), in a 2010 report that examined the relative cost per life year gained from various forms of physical activity, concluded that it was ""extremely unlikely"" to achieve a net benefit through the use of any one form of exercise.

For instance, according to ACSM's calculations, there are 3,300 additional lives saved with regular aerobic exercise compared to sedentary living, whereas 2,400 lives would be lost if people switched from their standard high-intensity aerobic workout routine to an alternative program like swimming or jogging. Moreover, if the same amount of energy and effort was expended by those who exercised in this way versus doing nothing at all, 1,600 more deaths could have been avoided. And this calculation includes the potential for long term health effects on heart disease, cancer, diabetes, stroke, and other chronic conditions, which may not be fully reflected in these numbers. However, even these estimates are relatively modest—a mere 20 percent increase in life expectancy per $1 spent on leisure time physical activity, such as running or walking. In addition, while there is some evidence that physical fitness can improve certain cardiovascular risk factors, such as blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, triglycerides, obesity, and sleep quality, and reduce other unhealthy behaviors, these studies tended to be small or were conducted among participants who had already developed the underlying cardiovascular risks.

The problem with comparing a single measure of physical activity, however, is that the effects vary greatly depending on the specific form of the activity. A study published last December in the journal Preventive Cardiology looked specifically at how much weight loss occurred when obese men exercised regularly versus simply sitting down for several hours each day. As expected, they found that overweight subjects who engaged in moderate exercise had almost twice as much weight loss and body fat reduction over just a few weeks than those who did no exercise at all. But the researchers also noted that exercise improved metabolic markers linked to fatness including insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles. These findings suggest that exercise might be beneficial even when done alone, but perhaps less so when combined with dieting or calorie restriction. If exercise does indeed help you lose weight, then perhaps it should also be encouraged along with weight control interventions.

Migraine attacks often start suddenly, at least four hours after taking a dose of a migraine drug, or several hours after starting treatment with another type of migraine medication. This is called a ""potential attack.""

Even though there aren't known causes of these attacks, researchers believe they could occur due to genetic factors, poor blood flow to parts of your brain involved in processing signals from nerves (e.g., your brain), or other issues related to the body's immune system.",121,numb fingers arthritis,-13.91092300415039,177,no_prompt,10,0.9943820224719101,185,0

These are tiny pits located on either side of the hair shaft, just behind where they meet the skin. If there are two or more of them around the hair shaft, then it might be genetic hair-druff susceptibility.

I've come a long way since my first post-MS diagnosis. I'm not at full strength yet and I still struggle with memory problems, but that is slowly getting better. I can now remember things I used to be unable to recall. The biggest thing is that while I am very active, I don't take many steps without help (in addition to walking most days). My daily activities include: swimming and biking, climbing stairs, eating, reading books, listening to music, and using a computer or tablet. I do enjoy playing board games such as ""Madden NFL"" and ""Halo.""

Do you think about the future? Do you know what you want to do once you get back to normal functioning? Or do you know where you're headed and just stay focused on improving yourself?

When my MS was diagnosed in 2003, I didn't even think about the future. It wasn't until four years later when someone suggested I would like to go into medicine after my MS had gone away that I began considering this. I know a lot of people who have gone from being an unemployed person to having a job and making decent money working as doctors, therapists, or social workers. Some people were lucky enough to make more than $100,000 before their MS went away. I know of others who made less but are still able to work. Others simply live independently and pay their bills with their own earnings. As much as I hate to admit it, some of those people are also recovering and enjoying life! Life is good!

There's been a resurgence in MS awareness lately and a number of studies have shown that people with MS are living longer than ever before (more research needed), so it's important that we take care of ourselves and look out for one another. What advice would you give to other people looking forward to starting a new chapter in their lives with MS?

Fetal death also happens during labor and delivery—about 1/3 of all maternal deaths are due to preeclampsia, the most dangerous condition for pregnant women in the United States. Preeclampsia develops after a woman's blood pressure drops too much during the second half of her third trimester. As the pregnancy progresses, an increase in blood vessels in the mother's uterus begin to block off some blood flow from the placenta. This causes a buildup of fluid around the fetus' organs, causing them to swell up, making it more likely that the embryo will be unable to survive outside the womb. The resulting heart failure can cause severe brain damage and even death by as early as the fourth week of pregnancy.

Preeclampsia is only one of many serious medical problems associated with pregnancy. In fact, nearly 6 million U.S. pregnancies each year end in pregnancy related complications. Many of those complications require medical care. For example, miscarriages account for about 40 percent of all abortions performed annually in the U.S. (1,2). Additionally, birth defects such as Down Syndrome account for 4 million American births every year, accounting for approximately $14 billion dollars in medical costs alone (3–6). Birth defects are the second leading cause of preventable mortality among children under the age of 5 worldwide (7).

In addition to these tragic medical consequences of pregnancy, babies born into poverty often suffer other adverse health conditions later in life because their parents lack adequate resources. Children living on less than $4 a day or in households with incomes below $12,000 have higher rates of obesity, diabetes, asthma, high cholesterol, poor hearing and vision and an increased risk of dying from homicide, unintentional injury and violence. These are just a few examples of what we know to be true of families who live in extreme poverty—the ""inner city"" problem.

What's more, people who experience pregnancy, childbirth, and infant and child care experience many of the same types of illnesses as adults. For instance, women living at home without paid family leave face an increased risk of having their infants exposed to harmful bacteria and viruses.

The next question is how to get the most out of a day spent reading. To answer this, we'll look at three different ways of consuming information: read more, read less and read more.

Read More

To make sure you're getting the full benefit from your time on the web, it's important that you're using an app that offers both a large selection of content and easy navigation for finding what you want to read. The following websites can help you discover new books or articles without having to start each one from scratch by browsing through the pages. They are divided into sections including fiction (including non-fiction), science fiction, and children's literature.

The first section is called ""literary fiction,"" which includes short stories, novels, poems, and collections. Literary fiction generally contains longer works than other genres, but the same author can write many different kinds of pieces of fiction over the course of years. Fiction in general tends to have fewer characters compared with other types of work, so it's better suited for those who enjoy reading shorter pieces.

The second category is called ""nonfiction"" and comprises nonfiction like essays, reports, reviews, and editorials. These might be useful if you prefer to read about the history of a particular topic rather than trying to figure out exactly what happened. You don't necessarily need to spend time researching all of the facts and figures involved when reading a book or article on nonfiction. For example, consider writing down some basic factoids about a subject such as its geography, name, culture, etc., just to help you remember where you learned something earlier.

For people who prefer to read articles written by experts on specific topics, there are several excellent options available. These include Slate, New York Magazine, Time, BBC News Online, USA Today, Business Insider, The Atlantic Monthly, Forbes, Scientific American, and many others. In addition to these sites, many local newspapers also offer free online editions.

Reading Less

If you're looking to cut back on consumption of media, there are plenty of great reasons why you should give up your favorite magazines and newspapers. As long as you know when it's too much time and money, the simple act of dropping them will allow you to focus instead on your own interests. And since you're likely already doing most of your reading offline anyway, this may be a good way to maximize your digital life.",8,best apps daily activity exercise diabetes,-10.933547973632812,112,no_prompt,10,0.4745762711864407,421,0
gpt2-large_63,"This is a difficult question for me to answer. I don't have any patients who are currently having MS, but there is an increasing number of people with MS that are experiencing symptoms and thinking about treatment options. Although many of these people will find their disease progresses over time, the decision whether or not to treat the current condition is always personal as well. If you feel like you would be better off waiting until your disability has progressed (e.g., if you have trouble walking), then your best bet might be to avoid MS altogether. On the other hand, if you feel that you can benefit from treating your current condition in its early stages, such as by taking medications to slow down the progression of the disease, then it's worth considering, especially since the rate of improvement may be faster than what we see with MS itself.

What is the most effective treatment for MS?

I'm going to focus on treatments focused specifically on treating neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. These treatments include:

Progression-free partial motor neuron stimulation (PFMN)

Lysosomal enzyme inhibitors, mainly alkylating enzymes, which bind with and inhibit the protein tyrosine hydroxylase

Metformin/metoprolol combination therapy

Riboflavin combined with silymarin, and tetracyclines that target glycogen synthase kinase

In addition, some doctors advocate using drugs directly targeted at brain cells. For example, this week, we published research showing that an experimental drug called Atenolol appears to work in mice. This suggests that Atenolol should be considered as part of the standard treatment regimen for those with chronic relapsing forms of MS. While we've found no clinical evidence for its effectiveness in humans yet, it has been shown to cause measurable decreases in brain inflammation in animal models.

How long does it take to cure MS?

Most people with MS progress slowly throughout their lifetime; in fact, they tend to experience fewer severe attacks than patients without MS. There is still a lot of hope among researchers and clinicians that a cure may occur within 20 to 30 years. It will likely be a slow process, however. For people diagnosed before age 50, there is good reason to believe that they may get worse before the onset of their first attack. The average life expectancy for people with MS is between 60 and 70 years.

""When you are exposed to the chemicals in a high concentration for extended periods of time, you are more likely to develop or experience some of these illnesses,"" said Margo Smith-Spangler, an MS researcher from the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine. ""There is a lot of research on these compounds that has not been done yet.""

Smith-Spangler conducted her study with a team of scientists from the University of South Carolina, Duke University Medical Center, UCSD and Johns Hopkins University. Their findings were published this week in JAMA Neurology.

While not every individual will be affected by all the chemical exposures, those who have existing medical conditions should take steps to reduce exposure, the researchers say. They recommend following the CDC guidelines regarding personal protection products such as baby bottles, air filters, sunscreens and hand sanitizer.


The researchers' work builds upon previous studies into the connection between chronic chemical exposures and the development of cancer and immune diseases. The new study also addresses how certain types of brain tumors may respond differently than others to chemical exposures.

gpt2-large_54,"Multiple Sclerosis Definition

The definition of Multiple Sclerosis, or MS, includes three major components:

A central nervous system (CNS) disease, which causes symptoms including pain, fatigue and joint problems. In many cases, a separate diagnosis is needed for the other symptoms. The CNS disease may be part of an autoimmune condition that damages the immune system by attacking the body's own tissues.

An inflammatory disorder, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. This can also affect the brain, but in fewer than 1 percent of cases the inflammation occurs only on one side of the body.

A specific type of cancer, most often sarcoma. Sarcomas are cancers of tissue above the heart (coronary artery). These tumors grow rapidly and become invasive; they usually spread to nearby lymph nodes. Once within these lymph nodes, they invade vital organs and sometimes kill them.

Diagnosis with MRI scans is rare because MRI scans help doctors see what parts of the brain have been damaged and how. But if you've had at least two MRIs during your lifetime, the Mayo Clinic has a list of potential diagnostic tests. These include CT scan, T1-T2 and/or T3 blood work, MRI, and nerve conduction studies (NCEs). NCEs detect chemicals associated with nerve damage in the muscles that control movement. These chemical changes may indicate nerve damage in a specific area. It takes between five weeks and six months for symptoms to show up, according to MayoClinic.com.",54,What does multiple sclerosis diagnosis include?

This episode of The Doctors features Dr. David Reichert, MD, an associate professor in the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and founder of MindBodyGreen. He also serves as director of the Prevention Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital.

David Reichert: We're joined now by Dr. David Reichert. Thanks for being here.

Bryan: You have a fascinating background. I was surprised when I first met you that you had done so much research on this topic. Can you explain how you ended up doing all this research? It sounds like a really interesting area of study.

Dr. Reichert: Actually it came from my own experience. In college, we were actually trying to figure out how many people got depressed. One student had been hospitalized because of depressive episodes. So there's a real problem with diagnosis and treatment of depression and suicide in our community and around the world.

And we'd come across this very complex issue, which we call the ""suicide paradox."" Depression often leads to suicidal ideation and attempts but then sometimes it doesn't. So we wondered whether there might be some connection between those two things, whether depression led to suicidal thinking and then depression could lead to suicidal behaviors.

So we did a series of studies over the last 10 years that examined that question, particularly looking specifically at suicide rates among U.S. adolescents. Those results suggested that there may indeed be a relationship between depression and suicidal behavior, especially among younger students, even though the rate isn't quite there yet. But if we look at suicide rates among young adults, they tend to rise significantly every year until the early 2000s. They've stabilized since then.

Bryan: Do you think these rates will ever get back down to normal? Are you optimistic? Or do you think maybe this is just one more indication that life still seems hard and that some folks need help?

Dr. Reichert: Well, we don't know how long it'll take for them to go back to normal. That said, the data does suggest that most people who feel depressed tend not to try to kill themselves again. On average, we find that they attempt suicide less than once a month; most frequently less than five times a year.

What is Integrative Medicine?


Integrative medicine refers to a variety of methods used in a patient's medical treatment that address the entire body, not just specific diseases (i.e., cancer). These may be traditional Chinese medicine, herbal medicine, massage therapy, acupuncture, chiropractic, alternative therapies, physical exercise, and much more. A single practitioner can specialize in any or all of these treatments at once. They use different techniques to help each individual respond to their particular ailment. For example, some practitioners might try to prevent or treat allergies using natural remedies, while others may seek out herbs for headaches. Some practices involve direct contact with nature (such as meditation), while others may require more formal training to get into the field. Finally, many practitioners practice together to create a synergy between their own unique abilities and knowledge with those from other disciplines.

""When we started looking into this, there were a few things that stood out,"" says Dr. David G.

""First off, it's not clear how many of these people are actually suffering from it.""

For instance, he explains, people with PTSD often can't recall traumatic events. But many have other problems like anxiety disorders, depression and substance abuse issues. Many also report difficulty sleeping, mood swings and eating behaviors that are similar to those seen among patients with schizophrenia.

The new study adds to a growing body of research suggesting that some people may be prone to developing severe posttraumatic stress disorder, which has been linked to violent behavior. (Related: ""6 Ways PTSD May Be Causing Violent Behavior."")

Schulman notes that more studies need to determine whether the disorder is more prevalent than previously thought. He also cautions against concluding that all people who suffer from PTSD will develop it. ""We don't know if most cases are going to go untreated because of stigma, social factors or lack of treatment options,"" he says.

The study involved 1,025 MS patients diagnosed between January 2007 and December 2011. The median follow-up was 6.9 years with an average delay of 2.8 years. Seventy percent were women; 35 percent had MS, 25 percent had other neurologic conditions or neurological diseases, 10 percent had cardiovascular disease, and 4 percent had kidney disease. Participants ranged in age from 55 to 87 with the mean age of 68 years. One-third were white, one third black, and one quarter Asian/Pacific Islander. Forty-five percent were men, 19% were women, 21% were older than 65 years old, and 12% reported that they were disabled because of MS. The researchers analyzed data from four electronic databases: MEDLINE (1966 to 2009), EMBASE (1970 to 2009), National Health Service Central Register (1993 to 2008) and Ovid Medline (1988 to 2009).

Results showed significant differences between race/ethnicity, gender and disability status among participants: In terms of race/ethnicity, blacks accounted for 52 percent of all cases and 43 percent of chronic relapsers while whites accounted for 42 percent of all cases and 30 percent of chronic relapsers. Among those with MS, males accounted for nearly twice as many cases compared to females. There also were significant differences between race/ethnicity, gender and disability status among the population of patients who did not have symptoms at baseline: White people had almost double the numbers of relapses compared to non-white people with MS.

""In our study, we saw no differences between different races and genders regarding relapse rates,"" said Dr. Sajid Ahmad, co-author of the paper published in Annals of Internal Medicine. ""However, when you look at disability level, there is still evidence of racial difference.""

Commenting on the findings, Dr. Robert Bales, director of research at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told Medical News Today:

There's strong evidence about what causes MS. But some studies indicate the incidence may be higher in certain populations, especially in ethnic minorities, such as African Americans and Hispanics. We know how to prevent it -- diet, exercise, medication -- but we don't know why.

It might come down to genetics, but also possible environmental factors like pollution or poor nutrition in developing countries.

Many different factors, such as physical activity and diet, play a role in determining the overall health status of individuals with MS. However, the most important factor that has been shown to affect MS pathogenesis is the presence of autoimmune disease. In MS, immune cells called T-cells (Th1) are activated by a specific type of antigen known as autoantibodies [ ]. The Th1 response results from activation of the innate immunity; it triggers production of interferons (IFN)-α, IFN-β, IL-17, and other cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). This response then leads to a series of inflammatory and autoimmune responses. Some of these events can be controlled through treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs or by altering the body's nutritional and/or environmental exposures.

Several studies have demonstrated that dietary antigens can be used as biomarkers for detecting chronic inflammation in MS [, ]. A number of published studies demonstrate that foods containing gluten, wheat, rye, barley, oats, or spelt are associated with elevated levels of soluble tissue transglutaminase and prothrombin time immunoglobulin A (PTCI), markers of inflammation, compared with control foods, particularly in patients with active MS [ ]. However, this association does not necessarily mean that certain food groups cause more inflammation than others. For example, while some researchers believe that the glycemic index (GI) of whole grains contributes to their increased risk of autoimmune disease, others argue that higher GI foods actually increase the sensitivity to proinflammatory mediators [ ]. The level of inflammation is also affected by the particular nutrients consumed in food preparation, cooking techniques, and other variables associated with its consumption. Because all these factors influence the rate at which food enters our bodies, a better understanding of how food affects our immune system will aid our ability to treat and prevent diseases like MS.

The relationship between MS symptoms and the intake of specific foods could be one explanation why several studies have suggested a link between eating disorders and MS [, ]. One study found that MS patients who were obese had a lower prevalence of MS than those with normal weight or normal body mass index [ ], a finding that was confirmed by another analysis [ ]. Another recent study found that women with MS who reported binge eating during pregnancy were twice as likely to develop MS as non-binge eaters [ ]. These findings suggest that eating disorders may contribute to MS pathogenesis, but",92,causes of fatigue in MS,-10.305746078491213,81,no_prompt,10,0.36160714285714285,414,33
gpt2-large_22,", I would like to know whether the same can be said about other types of cancer?

If you are obese and have a history of breast or prostate cancer, there is good evidence that eating more fat (eg: saturated fats) and less carbohydrates will reduce your risk. However, it seems unlikely that this would apply to all cancers; rather, the weight gain associated with obesity might make some cancers more likely than others. For example, it appears that women who are overweight or obese tend to develop esophageal adenocarcinoma at a higher rate than non-obese controls (4).

The following information comes from two studies published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO): The effect on tumor progression of high vs low carbohydrate diets: A randomized trial on patients with gastric carcinoma or hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing surgery: A double blind controlled study. (2013) by Sörensen et al (5), and the effects of high vs low protein diet on the development of gastric carcinomas. (2015) by Kringelbach et al (6). Both studies compared groups given either high protein or low protein diets. The only major difference between these two trials is that the authors found no benefit to low protein over high protein in the development of gastric carcinoma, while both groups showed a reduction in the number of tumours as the length of survival increased. This was unexpected because, if they had observed any beneficial effect of lower protein foods, then we would expect their study group to show an increase in survival compared to the control group. Instead, they actually showed a decrease in survival across the board (Figure 1).

Why does one type of cancer seem to do better when consuming a high carb diet than another type of cancer? Is it possible that low carbohydrate may prevent cancer by stimulating growth through insulin resistance? If so, why?

There has been considerable debate recently about how carbohydrates affect insulin sensitivity (7-11). There are several plausible explanations for the apparent differences in insulin response among different cancers. However, most of these hypotheses rely upon uncontrolled observational data, which need to be confirmed experimentally before they can be taken seriously. In particular, although the investigators of this study attempted to replicate previous studies where high protein diets were shown",22,my risk for developing type 2 diabetes,-13.238140106201172,245,no_prompt,10,0.98,414,4

The treatment options in the management of MS can vary widely. Some patients are able to respond well to a regimen of lifestyle changes, while others may require more aggressive approaches. As with any disease, there is no single way that a person will respond to an MS treatment. A doctor's decisions regarding how best to treat a patient should be based on his or her judgment and experience.

When a patient becomes symptomatic, the treatment plan must include all available evidence-based treatments. The treatment plan is also guided by the principles established in the Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Guidelines published by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (MS Society). This guideline provides guidelines for making decisions about therapy, including when and what therapies are appropriate. When possible, the treatment plan should be tailored to each individual patient. If the treatment plan does not work as planned or if it causes significant side effects, then the physician should evaluate alternatives. In addition, medications used to treat MS have been shown to have some benefit; however, they cannot cure MS nor slow its progression.

Multiple Sclerosis is characterized by relapses. It occurs when the body's immune system attacks healthy cells, which lead to inflammation, pain, fatigue, and memory loss. These conditions are typically treated with drugs called immunomodulators, such as corticosteroids or interferon beta, which increase the body's ability to defend itself against infection. While these medications help control the condition temporarily, relapse rates can be high after one year, sometimes resulting in disability or death.1

If you think you might have MS, talk to your health care provider immediately. Your doctor will perform physical exams, ask about other medical conditions, and refer you to specialists who specialize in MS. You'll likely see several different doctors over the course of your recovery: general practitioners, neurologists, primary care physicians, specialty hospitals, mental health providers, family medicine physicians, dermatologists, ophthalmologists, oncologists, cardiologists, infectious diseases specialists, and other specialists. If you're at risk for developing MS, your healthcare provider may recommend early screening to determine whether you're at increased risk for developing the disease. For example, your doctor may request blood tests to test for immune system disorders like HLA (human leukocyte antigen) mismatches or CCR5/6 abnormalities.

What Type Of Therapy Should I Choose?

There are two main types of medicines used to treat MS: immunosuppressive drugs and",68,List of multiple sclerosis symptoms,-6.637773990631104,132,no_prompt,10,0.5972850678733032,396,13

A recent study showed a strong association between HLA type DQB1*0201/DQB1*0400/DQB1*0501 and clinical progression in relapsing-remitting MS patients. The authors concluded that HLA genotype may contribute to the pathogenesis of this form of MS, as it is possible that genetic variation within the DQB genes has been linked to susceptibility to these advanced disease symptoms (Eli et al., 2010).

HLA Type DQB1*002 and RAP1: Risk factors for MS

In addition to HLA class I alleles, another group of HLA proteins also influences susceptibility to MS. In general, these are known as anti-inflammatory proteins. These include several classes of cytokines and chemokine receptors and their ligands such as IL-10 and IFNγ (Gonzalez-Ruiz et al., 2002; Pascual et al., 2005; Moya-Reyes et al., 2008) and have shown an inverse relationship with MS occurrence and severity (Moody et al., 2012b). However, there are differences among different subpopulations when it comes to the expression of these immune responses. For example, individuals from Mexico harbor more pro-inflammatory HLA molecules than those from other regions (Pascual et al., 2006a). Another interesting finding was the ability of HLA subtypes to predict which people would experience relapse or disability after treatment (Sánchez-Cruz et al., 2009).

Studies into HLA Class I alleles have suggested an effect on the development of autoimmune diseases, but these studies have largely involved small cohorts and have failed to show any clear evidence for a causal link between HLA polymorphisms and MS. Indeed, in a large prospective cohort study of over 4000 MS cases, it appeared that HLA alleles were not associated with the incidence of new onset MS (Chen et al., 2008), while the most common HLA allele (A958V) was found to be the strongest predictor of the recurrence rate in newly diagnosed MS patients (Wang et al., 2011). There are exceptions to this as reported below. In particular, a number of studies have identified a negative relationship between HLA polymorphisms and MS.

PALS, a disease-modifying drug, may be one possible treatment for this devastating disease. The trial was originally designed to examine the safety and efficacy of an oral formulation of NAC versus placebo in patients with primary progressive MS.

To test whether patients receiving NAC had a lower incidence of disability progression compared to those on placebo after two years, we randomly assigned patients who received NAC to receive either a single daily dose of 200 mg or 400 mg as part of the standard therapy for PALS or a placebo tablet once daily over 12 weeks. After the first year, follow up studies were conducted to determine whether these results remained statistically significant at six months and 12 months, respectively.

At study entry, there was no difference between baseline group and control groups in terms of age, sex, race/ethnicity, education level, employment status, physical activity level, family history of MS, annual household income, or use of any other chronic medications (such as immunosuppressant drugs). In addition, all patients participated in clinical assessments every three months throughout the study period, including the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Assessment Scale (MFAS), and the Motor Function Test Battery (MFTB) while taking their usual prescription medication. There were also no differences in weight loss, sleep duration, appetite, or gastrointestinal symptoms between the two groups before and after each time point. All participants completed several cognitive tests during the course of the study, but none showed clinically meaningful improvement. As expected, neither active nor placebo NAC significantly decreased disability progression at 6 months (P =.79).

The mean percentage change from baseline in the total score of the MMSE and MFAS was 2.3% and 0.7%, respectively. Between 26% and 44% of patients in the placebo group reported complete remission of disability progression, compared with less than 9% of those in the NAC group. At 12 months, both groups had similar levels of functional impairment and disability, with slightly higher scores in the NAC group compared with the placebo group. A decrease in the prevalence of severe disability progression occurred only in the NAC group (from 32% to 21%). Patients in the NAC group did not show clinical benefit from the drug, suggesting that even if the drug reduced the incidence of disability progression, it may not have been enough to achieve beneficial effects. The median",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-4.695940017700195,63,no_prompt,10,0.47368421052631576,410,3
gpt2-large_93,"The data is mixed, but most studies suggest that sleep disturbances are a strong risk factor for MS. In one study of more than 3,000 adults with MS, those who slept less than seven hours a night were about three times as likely to develop the disease compared to those who slept 8-9 hours or more per day. Other research suggests that people who have difficulty staying asleep may also be at greater risk for other conditions such as dementia. These factors may explain why fewer women have been diagnosed with MS over the last 30 years (though recent findings indicate that it is becoming increasingly common).

One group of researchers has proposed that sleep deprivation leads to an increased risk for developing MS and that this effect is caused by decreased levels of an enzyme called amyloid beta peptide (Aβ), which helps to make proteins known as tau. This process is thought to contribute to the development of neurodegeneration. However, there's not enough evidence on how the mechanism works yet, so it remains unclear whether this contributes to the increased risk of MS among people who sleep poorly. Another possible explanation would be that poor sleep could lead to inflammatory changes that can trigger the production of Aβ in the brain.

(B–C) A model for predicting the risk of developing prostate cancer according to age at diagnosis and race/ethnicity, as well as a model for predicting the odds ratio of developing prostate cancer among those who tested positive in the PSA test. Men diagnosed before age 50 years were excluded from all analyses. Models are presented as 95% confidence intervals (CI). Analyses include adjusted estimates for covariates not normally distributed. All models were stratified by gender and study site. Results are shown as percentiles.

The analysis revealed strong association between PSA screening and reduced prostate cancer risk, but this effect did not reach statistical significance after adjustment for potential confounders, including age and race/ethnicity. Among blacks and Hispanics, the relative risks of developing prostate cancer were 0.65 (95% CI = 0.45, 1.20; P <.001), 0.79 (0.42, 1.54; P =.06) and 0.80 (0.43, 1.52; P <.01), respectively. There was no significant association between PSA testing and the risk of development of any other specific cancers in white or black men (Table 2 ). However, when we analyzed the associations between racial differences and all-cause mortality separately, we observed an inverse relationship between PSA testing and both the total number of deaths from prostate cancer and mortality from cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx, which are highly prevalent in low-income settings where PSA testing is more common ( Table 3 ), which suggests that PSA testing may be particularly important in populations with high prevalence of oral cavity and pharyngeal cancer.

DISCUSSION

This cohort study was designed to determine whether PSA testing may play a role in reducing prostate cancer incidence among men younger than 50 years. We found that there was an increase in the odds of having a positive PSA test among all men, regardless of their race, ethnicity, and age. This finding was consistent across many different demographic and socioeconomic factors, such as income and education levels, residence in metropolitan areas, exposure to air pollution, smoking status, and alcohol consumption. These results support prior studies that have demonstrated reduced rates of prostate cancer in low-income settings [19], [22] and suggest that PSA testing can be useful to identify men",116,outcome prostate cancer,-5.481770515441895,43,no_prompt,10,0.17338709677419356,390,16

The researchers said there may be more than one cause for this association; people who live far from big cities may have lower rates of the disease, for example. But in their case, they were unable to find anything about poverty or education — factors known to influence the risk of MS — so they turned to the most obvious factor: diet. The researchers said higher intake of red meat and other animal products is linked to increased risks of MS, but it's not clear how much effect that has on MS risk.

""Our research suggests that dietary habits are important determinants of MS incidence,"" lead researcher David Rippe, MD, said in a statement. ""Dietary patterns such as low-fat diets, whole grains, poultry, fruits and vegetables are associated with reduced risk.""",58,Risk to develop multiple sclerosis,-0.1571783274412155,1,no_prompt,10,0.004329004329004329,168,6

As a result of these results and others presented at the 2010 National Academies conference on diabetes care (4), the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2013 recommended that clinicians should routinely assess patients with type 1 diabetes to determine whether they have severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or hypopnea (hypoxaemia) as an underlying cause for their symptomatology (5).

To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate if CIT improves glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in people with type 1 diabetes, specifically those who also exhibit impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). We hypothesized that CIT would improve glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity among participants with IGT because IGT includes significant hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia as well as low plasma insulin levels (6–8). In addition, we predicted that if individuals with type 1 diabetes are treated with CIT to prevent or treat hypoglycemia/hyperinsulinemia, these changes will be more pronounced than expected based solely on the clinical features of type 1 diabetes. Additionally, we hypothesized that CIT would decrease the incidence of complications associated with type 1 diabetes by improving glycemic control through improved insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells and decreased peripheral arterial resistance. Because some individuals with type 1 diabetes, especially those without a history of hyperglycemia, experience adverse effects when prescribed CIT, such as hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, we reasoned that the therapeutic benefits of CIT may outweigh its potential harms. To test this hypothesis, we compared the characteristics of people treated with CIT to those who were untreated, which included those who received either standard medical management alone or CIT. The primary outcome measure was the change in fasting blood sugar, or FBS; secondary outcomes included changes in insulin sensitivity, lipids, CGM findings, and glucose tolerance testing.

All participants provided written informed consent after reading and understanding the procedures outlined in a standardized form before participation in the study.

The most effective exercises for improving flexibility in the arms are:

Exercise 1: Banded Arm Extension (Banded Arm Incline)

Lie on your back with your arm at a 45-degree angle, palms facing up toward the ceiling, while holding a dumbbell in each hand in front of you. Slowly bend one leg until it reaches an equal distance from the floor as well. Return to starting position by bending both legs and bringing them together. Repeat this exercise 20 times in 30 seconds with no rest between sets. This is a good way to keep your body in an ideal position for strengthening your core muscles.


Exercise 2: Leg Extension

Lie faceup on the floor or a bench with your knees bent at 90 degrees. Squeeze your gluteus maximus muscle and extend your left thigh to touch the ground. Extend the right leg to touch the ground and return to standing. Do not lower yourself below the knee level during this movement. Keep your heart rate elevated throughout the set so that your legs can contract harder. Perform this exercise 20 times with no rest between sets. You should feel your right and left sides contracting with every repetition and that your upper body moves through the appropriate range of motion. Be careful not to overdo this stretch -- you don't want to injure your glutes by allowing your hips to drop down too far when performing these exercises.

Exercise 3: Side Bends

On the side opposite the one you're doing the exercises in the list above, bend your knees while keeping your back straight. Bend your left elbow while extending your right arm out behind you while keeping your back straight. Pull the right ankle underneath your right knee. Hold for five counts then relax. Continue alternating sides on the left and right sides of the same side.

Exercise 4: Knee Raise

Sit on your heels with your feet hip-width apart. Keeping your elbows pointed outward, raise your buttocks off the floor to point your toes backward. While lifting your butt off the floor, slowly bend your knees and bring them into a neutral position. Repeat 15 times with no rest between sets. The goal here is to lengthen your abs and hamstrings. It also helps strengthen your quadriceps muscles.

Risks to your health

The short-term risk of permanent brain damage from a low dose of gamma rays is relatively small compared to the long term risks of these exposures. Long-term dangers are related to prolonged exposure, including cancers, neurological disorders, heart disease, breast cancer, and certain genetic diseases. As much as half of all survivors have received their first diagnosis of any form of cancer after they leave the military. For those who served in the Navy for 40 years or longer, the lifetime potential death rate could range between 25% and 90%. Of all veterans diagnosed with cancer at least five years after retirement, most (72%) experienced a recurrence within two years of treatment. These numbers may surprise you because many vets who serve long periods still face the same problems that occurred during active duty: sleep disturbances, muscle weakness, skin ulcerations, weight gain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and memory loss. Other veterans suffered from headaches, ear infections, chronic sinus infections, migraines, headaches, hearing loss, nausea, dizziness, depression, poor vision, and difficulty concentrating on work tasks.

The effects of long-term exposure are not easily measured using lab tests. When it comes to assessing risk factors like body fat and bone density, however, data have been gathered that indicate those individuals likely to experience the greatest risks come from those who had higher levels of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) while serving in the military. This is true even though there has never been proof that HRT reduces cancer risk—the only type of treatment proven effective. A study conducted over 30 years ago found that veterans had twice the rates of tumors as non-veterans. It's also believed that post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which frequently occurs among former service members, plays a role in the development of new cancers, especially if soldiers were exposed to highly toxic chemicals (like Agent Orange) at a time when they were taking large doses of them themselves. It's also known that a lack of exercise and diet choices make those prone to develop cancer vulnerable to environmental toxins. And it doesn't take much exposure to cause lasting harm; one 2011 study showed that an average of nine minutes per day of television viewing led to four times greater odds of developing lung cancer than regular TV watching.

Why is this so important? Because, if you're eating too much of what the mainstream nutrition community considers ""good"" foods—stuff that's low in calories but high in fat and salt—then your body will start to store less of it as energy and use it for other functions, like storing excess heat or storing water. As a result, you'll lose weight faster than you gain it—which means that you have to eat fewer calories to maintain your current weight while gaining weight! And if you do end up losing weight, then all that extra water you've been consuming over the course of the day won't get rid of all those pounds (you may still be dehydrated, though), so your overall caloric intake doesn't help with maintenance either.

This kind of thing happens all the time: people who exercise regularly don't just keep their weight off, they actually put on muscle and gain more muscle. But since we tend to think about dieting as something that occurs only when we need to, these kinds of changes aren't always visible on a daily basis; it can take years for us to notice them.

So why are we so hard-wired to make quick decisions based on our feelings rather than objective data? Part of the answer comes from evolutionary psychology: The human brain evolved to process information rapidly, whether by detecting predators or potential mates, finding food quickly or making decisions about sex. Since we rely on instinct for survival and reproduction, making fast decisions is often good news. Even if our gut instincts fail to turn out right, however, it's better to act early and try again, because even an experienced decision maker might not make the right one every single time.

But another part of the answer has to do with how we understand what constitutes healthy food. For many decades now, scientists have shown that eating mostly processed junk food promotes obesity and diabetes. Yet some studies suggest that certain types of ""whole grains,"" which include whole wheat flour, brown rice, oats, barley and corn, can actually help to prevent weight gain if eaten alongside healthy fats and proteins. So does this mean that people should eat mostly whole grains or not? Not necessarily. If you want to reduce your risk of being overweight or obese, you probably shouldn't go overboard eating whole grains; instead, focus on eating plenty of vegetables, fruits, lean protein sources and legumes (beans, lentils and peanuts).

She'll show you ways that you can make your problems easier for her by talking about them in detail.

What kind of treatment might I need?

There's no doubt that many women who come into counseling have been through traumatic events such as family breakdowns, abuse, divorce and other adversities. But counselors often find themselves having to deal with women whose lives haven't gone exactly as planned, or who have been victims of domestic violence. If there are children involved, they may be dealing with their own trauma or suffering from severe depression and anxiety. These women are likely to require a different kind of treatment. While some programs offer group sessions and individual therapy, others provide counseling services only, which can be hard to arrange. Some therapists, particularly those in rural areas or with limited resources, might prefer to use outpatient programs where they can see patients regularly and provide therapy without leaving home.

How much time does it take?

The average session takes between one and two hours, although a few experts recommend longer sessions. If there are kids involved, most counselors suggest that children stay at least overnight during their session. In any case, the counselor needs to know when to stop and end, so that both sides can get an idea of what has occurred and why it happened. One way to structure the session is to give each side time to speak before the next set of statements and ask the woman what she wants to say. You should try to keep the sessions shorter than the normal length – sometimes less than 15 minutes – to avoid overloading the client's brain while still allowing enough time for reflection and for people to feel heard and understood.

In some cases, the disease process was detected in two of the preceding conditions, but not both. In these instances, the clinical diagnosis was made based on a single test result, which is an indication that the condition should be considered as a separate entity from the other two. It may also be appropriate for physicians to identify patients who present with one of these disorders, even if all three are present.

When I talk to patients who are complaining about backaches, I often hear ""My wife sleeps in my bed!"" They say that it relieves the pain and helps them relax (and they have no idea how). It doesn't take long before I can tell if they were actually using bed sharing or simply telling the truth when they say they slept on their sides.

As well, many studies show that when you sleep on your back, you'll be more prone to developing other problems like diabetes. So while we may all feel better after having sex, or at least have less pain, our bodies aren't always ready to move on to other activities. So, taking care of our backs can certainly be a good thing! 🙂

If you've read any of these articles, then you already understand that I personally don't have any issues with bed sharing or having my spouse sleep in my bed. However, I am aware of some people who have trouble sleeping on their side and even some guys whose wives refuse to share their beds with them… Why does this happen?!

Let's take a look at these two questions: Does the person having sex with her/him want to go to bed? If the answer to both is yes, then she or he might feel the need to move away to find privacy or something else comfortable, which would put her/him in danger. Can she see where the person is going before entering the bed? This could mean that the person has moved closer to you and needs to go further into your body to avoid falling asleep.

The study team looked at the effects of oral contraceptive pill (OCP) and hormone replacement therapy on male fertility for five years. The results showed that oral contraceptives suppress ovulation in males by up to 70 per cent, but HRT inhibits this effect, decreasing it by 50 per cent. This means an increase in sperm production. It's been known for a long time that men have more than one egg per ejaculate; they don't need to make eggs as frequently or produce as many as women do. In fact, we've always believed that there were two types of eggs – those that are produced during puberty and those that are produced after menopause. These hormones that help control testosterone levels appear to be important here as well. If you use an OC, then you're going to get your first dose of the hormone before sex so you can get used to the change in timing of when you want to conceive. But if you take HRT, you won't even notice any change in the way you get pregnant because the body makes fewer oocytes. So that's why taking an OC is such a good idea. For people who already are using one type of birth-control pill or another, HRT could be very beneficial. You should still consider whether taking HRT may affect your ability to become pregnant. And in particular, remember that if you start taking an OC too soon (especially within six months), the risk of pregnancy may be increased.",126,birth control suppression antral follicle count,-8.231270790100098,16,no_prompt,10,0.13675213675213677,252,1

Most of the time though, there is nothing you can do about it as long as your diet and exercise are well balanced.I would start by checking for your thyroid, and try adding in some beta-blockers to make sure that you don't have too much or too little of a reaction if any. It also helps to see what side effects are happening on your body.Also check your blood sugar levels every 3 hours for an indication of possible hypoglycemia. It will usually go down within a few hours after starting with Tylenol if all of these things are working properly, although sometimes it takes a while. Once your blood sugar goes up however, then you need to take care of it more aggressively (such as eating large amounts of high fat foods such as chicken or fish). If it gets too high, you should probably stop taking it for at least one day or two before trying again.Also, do not use medications to treat it.

""My best guess would be that they were trying to help their patient. The problem was that she was an MS sufferer, so I think the doctors were treating her for something else. But they didn't know it yet.""

Irene Krasny, MD, MSN, FAAP, FACP

In 2009, Dr. O'Neill published a study on his website entitled ""MS Relapse,"" in which he reported that 40% of people who had severe relapses after being treated with a combination of steroids, nerve blockers and corticosteroids experienced symptoms of relapse two years later. It wasn't until 2010 that Dr. O'Neill published another study on MS relapsing in which he concluded, ""The data regarding MS relapses is conflicting at best."" (See also his article ""Fluid Medication, Multiple Sclerosis, and Risk Factors."")

As you can see from these two studies, the MS community has known about MS relapses for some time now. But we still don't have answers as to why MS relapses occur or how long they last—if ever.

A History of Questions

For nearly 30 years the National Multiple Sclerosis Society has been asking patients with MS the question, ""Why do you have MS?"" We've tried different approaches, including a questionnaire sent out to all Medicare beneficiaries to gather information about factors that might cause MS (see below). Our results show that many people give misleading responses when asked that question. That's because MS is thought to result from genetic mutations in genes linked to myelin development and, more recently, from abnormal cell migration within the brain. As I mentioned earlier, research suggests that MS isn't caused by any single factor; rather, it develops together with several conditions, such as autoimmune disorders, infections, cancer and other medical problems.

So we're going to change course and ask the question again, starting with a new survey. This one will focus on our most recent findings on MS progression, which will include questions that allow us to answer both our own MS-related questions and those of others. We plan to use these new surveys to find out how common MS reoccurrences are among patients with other illnesses, and if these recurrence rates compare to those seen among",83,Why get episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis?,-0.0359157584607601,2,question,1,0.008547008547008548,387,24

Q: Can I get pregnant during my treatment?

A: No. The only way to become pregnant is to engage in a surgical procedure called vasectomy. This involves removing the testicle from your body through a small incision in one side of your abdomen. You then undergo an open surgery known as laparoscopic surgery where the testicle is removed along with several other organs such as the kidney. There is no need to wait until after treatment to get pregnant because the sperm will probably already have entered your body by this point.

Q: When will my treatments last?

A: Treatment may take anywhere between 10 weeks to 12 months depending on how well you respond to each dose.

Q: Should I avoid exercise while taking this medication?

A: Exercise can help with the symptoms and improve many health related issues such as weight loss and heart disease. It also helps relieve symptoms associated with depression including anxiety and insomnia. Unfortunately, people who smoke or drink alcohol frequently could experience adverse reactions from the drug which include increased risk of blood clots, stroke, heart attack, and death. If you are concerned about your cardiovascular health, talk to your doctor first before starting any new medications.

Q: Does the drug affect appetite when taken regularly?

A: Most likely yes. A number of studies have been done on patients who had diabetes and were given either metformin or carbamazepine daily (which may cause nausea) and found that their appetites decreased. If you feel like you are constantly hungry but do not eat much, don't give up on eating! Just focus on being more active and making sure that you stay hydrated.

Q: Do I have to stop using this drug if I go into remission from Stage 1 or 2?

A: We know many patients who have gone into remission have continued taking this medication even though they have failed all other therapies available. However, we recommend that you monitor your liver function closely over the next few years so that you can decide if this type of treatment should continue if you choose.

When you can work a job that is physically demanding and provides income (such as a sales position), consider working part-time or studying for a degree at the university level (in college). In addition, keep in mind that your health insurance will likely cover many of these expenses. If you have a disability, ask the employer about options available to provide additional compensation. The benefits from any medical care or therapy provided by an MS provider are limited if not covered by your employee's health plan. Ask the employer for details on the cost per patient visit and what other benefits may be available. For more information about benefits coverage and eligibility, go to HealthCare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596.

Q: Are there other ways I can help pay my premiums?A: You can participate in a Health Savings Account (HSA) program to lower your monthly premium costs. There are several ways to open a HSA, including through employers, Medicare or Medicaid. To learn more, go to HealthSavingsAccounts.gov. You can also apply for tax credits based on your household income, and possibly qualify for assistance with some ACA-related requirements. Check out our web page on health savings accounts for more information.

Q: What happens when I miss a payment or fail to pay it all?A: Your account balance is ""stabilized"" until you make a regular repayment or default on your loan. If you don't pay on time or default on your loan, the interest rate increases. This means that even though you've paid off the loan, you may still owe money on it. If you fall behind on your payments, you'll receive notice from your insurer. If you do decide to stop paying on time, your policyholder will get a credit against their account that they should use to reduce the interest on the remaining unpaid balance. Some plans offer these features; others require them. Be sure to check your coverage to find out how the feature works and whether your coverage covers it.

Obesity can cause many health problems that affect the cardiovascular system, immune function and bone loss (osteoporosis). Obesity can also contribute to other serious medical conditions, like hypertension, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney disease, cancer, arthritis, nerve damage, respiratory disease, and depression.\r


While there are certain general trends for the incidence of chronic diseases, they vary from region to region and time to time. For example, in 2000-2001, 1.1 percent of all people aged 20 years and older had any chronic illness. However, in 2010-2011, this number rose to more than three times the rate in 1999-2000. The rise in rates may stem from changing patterns of aging, as the elderly population will increase until 2050 and then drop after that. There is no clear evidence of trends over time as some countries may not report data on their statistics for many reasons, such as being unable to collect data on non-communicable diseases because of privacy concerns or limitations on what information can be collected.\r

How is chronic disease treatment determined?

There are various ways to diagnose and treat chronic diseases. First, doctors use tests to examine the patient's body to determine if he or she is sick. Some tests require specialized equipment. If a doctor feels that the symptoms indicate a problem with the entire body, he or she may prescribe a drug. Drugs usually work best when used for longer periods of time (for instance, six weeks at a time) before a person becomes ill again. Doctors often recommend various medications for different types of illnesses. When a medication fails to work well enough for a particular condition or problem, another prescription might be needed. Although doctors sometimes find that a combination of drugs works better than one medication alone, these drugs have long side effects and can pose serious risks to the patient's health. Physicians also use alternative medicines to address specific needs; alternative medicine involves using herbal remedies, homeopathic remedies, natural products such as vitamins and herbs, and even supplements. These alternatives must follow FDA regulations governing safety. Another way to treat chronic illnesses is through physical therapy.",1,What are the most common chronic diseases?

The only thing that would be useful in this case would be if you could provide some sort of an abstract or a paper summarizing your experience so that my colleagues can learn more about the disease and what it has done to your life. It's also worth mentioning that people who are taking multiple sclerosis medications have sometimes been observed by their workplace medical staff to get sicker than normal patients with MS. However, I don't think anyone who works with patients who are on medication for MS actually knows anything about it (it is hard to tell them apart from other people). People do, however, often notice subtle changes in patients who take multiple sclerosis medicines. For example, when someone takes multiple sclerosis medicine they might suddenly develop a rash. So maybe that person's rashes were caused by the drug itself, rather than because of any underlying illness, such as allergies, which causes similar symptoms, especially around the time when the drug was given. That being said, there may be some cases where these problems occur even without treatment of the disease. There is no way of knowing. In addition, as one of many factors involved, workers and managers may feel uncomfortable talking about this topic with people who they consider to be family members. Also, this issue doesn't usually cause much angst among employers, since most employers allow employees to discuss personal health matters publicly. Still, it would be good to know more about the possibility of problems caused by multiple sclerosis drugs.

Q: What is your opinion regarding MS as a cause of infertility?\nAnswer: This is a very difficult question to answer, since I had never seen one before. And although I saw several references online, none seemed to describe exactly what I had read about MS causing infertility. Some suggested that women suffering from MS would become infertile due to a drop in the number of sperm produced. Others thought that the drop in numbers of sperm would result in the loss of sex hormones and thus the failure to conceive. The problem here is that there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support either of those claims. To begin with, let me state that while it is true that women suffer from MS, I doubt that they would give birth to babies during a period when MS was present. A woman's body does not produce enough sperm to compensate for the lack of semen. Secondly, the claim that women diagnosed with MS cannot conceive children, well, it just isn't true.

But, like all diets, it can be tough to know exactly what's good for you – especially if you have an existing medical condition or are on medications that may interact with some other supplements. So, before going down this road, make sure you understand your specific needs.

Ketone bodies are secreted when glucose levels drop below about 70 mg/dL (2 mmol/L). When blood sugars fall too low, the body makes ketones in the liver (ketosis) and uses those as energy, which improves insulin sensitivity. Ketones also provide fuel to cells during periods of fasting. However, the amount of ketones produced depends on how much glucose is present in the bloodstream after meals. The more glucose there is in the bloodstream, the greater the production of ketones. In fact, many types of diabetes drugs inhibit the release of ketones from the liver. Therefore, although blood sugar levels tend to decline naturally over time, they're still very sensitive to fluctuations in blood glucose. It can take days to recover fully from a low-carbohydrate diet because of this sensitivity. A high-fat diet will result in a slower rate of ketogenesis. Because of this, a higher fat intake can cause weight loss and improve insulin resistance in type 2 diabetics – but at risk for kidney damage.

A ketogenic diet involves replacing carbohydrates with fats. Most foods are either partially or completely composed of animal products, such as eggs, meat, fish and dairy. Eating these foods helps maintain blood glucose levels while decreasing the need for insulin injections. Carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars called glucose, fructose and lactose, which enter the brain through the portal vein system, a collection of small arteries running between the kidneys. Once transported, the glucose, fructose and lactose leave via another branch of the same artery system.

Low carbohydrate diets can reduce blood pressure. High blood pressure is associated with diabetes, heart disease, stroke, hypertension and even death. People who develop cardiovascular problems appear to have less control of their blood sugars than normal-weight individuals, suggesting that chronic inflammation plays a role in contributing to high blood pressure. As mentioned above, some types of diabetes drugs suppress blood sugar and therefore have a negative effect on blood pressures. For example, patients taking Metformin are at increased risk of having elevated blood pressures. Diabetic ketosis can worsen any underlying health conditions and predispose someone to",35,Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?,-0.1099159345030784,4,question,1,0.025806451612903226,416,25

For those who do not have much time or money (or both), there are plenty of free physical activities available on the web (such as these free fitness apps).

Another question from a reader asks if it would be better to drink water before eating. The answer is no - drinking more water does not increase weight gain. Drinking 1 litre of water every hour for two days after having had an energy-enhancing meal could actually make you fatter! But the reason is that the extra fluid needs to go into your stomach and intestines, so some of the excess fluids will end up in your stomach. It is recommended that people with weak digestive systems drink 2 litres per 24 hours to avoid this problem. If you don't have strong digestion then you will end up consuming more calories, and therefore you may end up gaining weight too. That said, it might be best to eat something like pasta with green peas, which are higher in fibre (and thus healthy!) than other similar foods.

A final question asked whether we should take more vitamin D pills than we already use. This comes from someone who has been taking 500mcg/day (500 micrograms) of synthetic vitamin D3 since 2012, even though he still needs to supplement his diet. He recommends that we consume 1500mg (1400mcg) a day (1500mcg equals 1.5 milligrams of Vitamin K2). A 2000 mcg dose of vitamin D3 taken once a week would be equivalent to taking 3000mcg.

For example, some people sit at the end of a long day at the office when they could be at home or playing with their kids, and this causes them to have to stretch out their muscles. In order to reduce strain on these muscle groups (and therefore increase flexibility), we recommend standing while walking at first. If you walk slowly enough for at least 20-30 seconds every minute, you should start seeing improvements immediately.

The most common reason for using this product is for arthritis of the hands or feet (fascia).


When we first started working with our clients about the symptoms they had when having to work in a very cold climate, it was obvious that people were suffering from extreme pain on their hands and feet. After several months of talking about this issue with some medical professionals, we realized there might be other factors at play as well, so we decided to investigate further into how this disease affects different skin areas on humans. The research has shown that even in situations where temperature drops to the freezing point or below, the body still does its best to keep us warm through sweating. The skin surrounding our joints contains large amounts of blood vessels which are constantly pumping blood throughout all of our tissues. In order to maintain proper blood flow, these vessels must stay warm enough during the day. We've discovered that the muscles around our wrists are particularly sensitive to this condition because they have more of these small blood vessels than anywhere else in the body. When these arteries become stiff, it can lead to painful and sometimes severe symptoms such as tingling, burning, stiffness, swelling and loss of feeling. As the circulation within these veins gets blocked or slowed down by muscle weakness, we experience what many call ""cold"" wrist pains.


This type of problem happens when the muscles around the joints stop producing sufficient blood to replace the lost fluid, which results in a drop in blood pressure. In addition to preventing the blood supply from getting too low, muscles are also responsible for distributing heat through the system. This means that if the sweat glands aren't fully functional, the skin becomes excessively cold, leading to pain. Most often, patients report numbness and/or burning sensations in their hand/foot area while wearing this product. However, if you feel itchy or irritated on the affected area, it may be due to an infection and need to see your doctor immediately.

Do not use shampooing products that contain alcohol. Alcohol can cause rashes and burns on the skin. Using shampoo without alcohol will also irritate your scalp or leave it dry. A good alternative for washing your hair would be using shampoo with natural ingredients such as tea tree oil (such as Jojoba). However, if using soap or shampoo containing alcohol is necessary for your health reasons, please consult your doctor before using any products.

When should I wash my hair?

Hair must be washed when there are no signs of infection (for example, if it has been in contact with an infected wound) or irritation from the shampoo. If there are signs of infection, it's important to rinse immediately. Once again, once the condition has healed, it's best to go ahead with a fresh treatment plan.

What kind of shampoo should I use?

Before using any shampoo, talk to your dermatologist about whether there are specific conditions that require a particular type of shampoo. Some ingredients include glycerin which contains fragrance, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mineral oil. These can interfere with each other's effectiveness. Additionally, some types of detergents may have chemicals in them that may cause damage to your hair. The safest options for shampooing are those that are made with just one ingredient and contain only what is needed for your needs.

Should I shampoo while wearing my makeup?

Yes, you should always shower after taking your make-up application off. Shampooing at this time allows moisture to penetrate into the hair. It also helps keep your pores open so that toxins don't enter your system. While shampooing is recommended every few days, you can use more frequent shampoos if you prefer.

Well, what you might want to consider is that this isn't the same as getting rid of them entirely. They have been exposed to allergens and bacteria throughout their lives so if you have problems with them during pregnancy or after having kids, you will still experience those issues, but if your child is healthy then you may find that you have less of an issue with any one specific element of the diet because the foods you eat are likely to contain more of these elements. And since the amount of allergens in a food varies greatly, some people do have a harder time dealing with certain foods while others (like me) won't notice a difference unless they really focus on eliminating them completely. In addition, many things like sugar and starch are just easier to deal with than proteins or fats, even though protein and fat are extremely important components of a balanced diet. So while there's no way that you'll eliminate everything from your diet, what we can do is take steps to make sure that we avoid exposing ourselves to anything that's potentially dangerous or unhealthy.

If you have a history of MS or other diseases that might make your life more difficult, please see our Patient Information page.

Q: What if I have an autoimmune disorder such as lupus erythematosus (LY) and/or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)?\nA: Your doctor may test you to determine if there is a connection between your condition and another medical condition. In most cases, an initial physical exam will check for any symptoms of a specific illness.

If your diagnosis includes lupus or SLE, it is important to note the following:

The immune system cannot fight off all types of viruses or bacteria that cause lupus, so your body fights them off. You can develop both lupus and SLE through viral infection; however, some people do not experience these symptoms until they start having recurrent viral infections in their lifetime.

Most people who get LY have mild symptoms. However, others may still be able to function well despite having severe lupus-like symptoms such as fatigue, pain, joint pains, muscle weakness and joint stiffness.


Lyme disease and associated problems can occur even without a first diagnosis of lupus. For example, people with Lyme disease (chronic borreliosis), which also causes the same symptoms, often don't realize that their body isn't treating lupus properly. They could develop the same complications as people who have MS but who aren't diagnosed until later in life because they hadn't realized they had lupus yet.

People who were never infected by an animal should take precautions to prevent getting sick from animals, especially ticks. Tick bites are usually painful and can spread illness to humans and sometimes animals. Therefore, tick protection products must be worn when outdoors and use insect repellents such as DEET when outside.

7. This problem cannot be treated without surgery.

8. The mainstay in treating MS is taking steroids, anti-inflammatories and/or radiation therapy to treat the inflammation within your brain. Some people use corticosteroids, which can decrease the amount of oxygen available to your cells.

Question: When did the term ""integrative"" become widely known among medical practitioners?\nAnswer: In 1988, when Dr. John C. Cleland published The Principles of Integrative Medicine[1], he defined integrative medicine as being based upon the following principles:[2]

1) All processes within human life are interconnected, but individual actions may affect them differently and interactively; 2) There are no universal principles or systems in nature. Rather, they are interrelated by mutual influence and interaction between diverse components; 3) Human beings have a biological diversity that influences our experience of reality, thereby affecting how we think about ourselves and our environment; 4) Health can be achieved through interactions between various systems in order to create a more optimal state of living for all.

In other words, integrative medicine attempts to combine multiple facets of modern medicine into one system that works together, while at the same time providing effective treatments that work for everyone.

Question: What is the relationship between chiropractic and integrative medicine?\nAnswer: Chiropractic and Integrative Medicine (ICM) are complementary approaches to care focused upon the body's nervous system. It describes the role of nerve function, physical sensations, the body's ability to heal itself, as well as what happens as this system heals itself.[3] For example, ICM focuses on balancing nervous system functions such as balance, blood pressure, pain tolerance, digestion, immune health, sleep quality, coordination, etc., whereas chiropractic seeks to alleviate these symptoms in order to improve overall patient health.

Question: How do you distinguish chiropractic from ICM and why do you recommend a chiropractor as your primary physician?\nAnswer: Because chiropractic is based upon principles of natural healing, chiropractors cannot claim to provide only alternative methods of treating problems; instead, they use a combination of basic scientific techniques, traditional spinal manipulation techniques, and psychological therapies.[4] However, there is a difference between",51,What is holistic medicine and what does it include?,-9.175477981567385,54,question,1,0.2887700534759358,365,20

A. Do people with BPD use alcohol or drugs?

BPD people are likely to be heavy drinkers and/or drug users in general (Table 3). There are some differences between these groups. For example, women tend to be more prone to using alcohol than men do (Figure 1), while there is evidence of sex differences in substance abuse disorders. Additionally, many cases of BPD are associated with co-occurring mood disorders such as depression and anxiety, which may make it difficult for someone with BPD to find help when needed.

Although the current prevalence rates of BPD have dropped dramatically from about 6% of the population in 1997, they remain high among individuals who identify as LGBTQ or questioning. In addition, recent studies indicate that even though the percentage of bisexual and polysexuals has decreased significantly over time, this group still suffers disproportionately from the effects of BPD. It should also be noted that although there was an increase in bisexuality among youth aged 16–24 years in the 1990s, it appears that there has been no further change since then [16]. Because the prevalence rate of bipolar I disorder in persons with BPD is currently estimated at approximately 12%, as compared to 4–5% in persons without BPD, it stands to reason that BPD can become a chronic disease, making its treatment difficult and costly. As such, it would appear that prevention efforts could benefit from targeting individuals with BPD in particular populations where the risk factors involved in the disease would be most evident, including transgender individuals.

At that point, treatment starts with medicines to try to slow down the progression. After several years, the symptoms will go away again, leaving your brain functioning normally once more. The second stage occurs when the disease progresses into another type of progressive disease called secondary progressiveMS. This can be caused by many different factors including infection, viral or bacterial infections as well as radiation therapy. In both cases, if you are already taking medication for other conditions, it may not do much good against MS either.

If you don't want to be on any meds for your anxiety or depression (and I'm sure that most people would agree), then a few basic things are necessary. First off, make sure you are taking them as prescribed by your doctor. If not, make sure you ask about the reasons why. There are several different types of antidepressants available. The most common ones include Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, and others. However, there are also other medications such as Seroquel (which has some serious side effects) and Risperdal (which has some serious risks).

A: ""It's not the fatigue itself that causes it to be so bad,"" says Dr. Richard J. Miller, director of neurology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. ""The problem is when you're asleep or sleeping for long periods of time without rest -- which can happen, especially during sleep deprivation -- there's an overload on your brain cells"" called myelin. This insulating layer protects nerve cells from injury, slows down cell division, and prevents them from dying off. Myelin also helps transmit signals between neurons and enables one to send electrical impulses in another. The more myelin you lose while awake, the worse your condition will become. In addition to stress, inflammation, infection (including HIV), and other conditions, fatigue also has been linked to poor blood circulation, lack of oxygen, dehydration, infections, and obesity, as well as other physical ailments such as heart disease, high cholesterol, and diabetes. It affects every organ system but bone marrow, liver, kidneys, and fat tissue. But while many patients feel fatigued during sleep, some can improve and even regain the ability to function by simply waking up and taking a short break. Many people develop sleep problems later in life, however, especially those who've had fibromyalgia. They experience morning stiffness, frequent colds, headaches, fatigue, and depression after they're no longer able to stay asleep throughout the day, often going back to work at night.

gpt2-large_57,"I have been asked this question many times and the correct answer is that it depends on your age. You will have a stage, or stage 1 (which is called ""refractory"" by MS specialists). The next stage in MS is stage 2 with the progression of disease into an advanced stage 3, which is almost impossible to cure because of the loss of immune system function due to the immune system attack on the nerve endings. The fourth stage is the last phase where the patient becomes totally paralyzed, but there are ways to survive without any functioning of your nervous system. There are no signs of improvement until you reach stage 4 or 5, when your condition gets more severe.

QUESTION: how much of my blood can be converted into energy? Answer: Your body has a limited amount of oxygen available for use, so it needs additional fuel for energy production. The main source of oxygen for the human body comes from the lungs; however, this system requires additional amounts of oxygen to maintain function. Because of this requirement for extra oxygen, your liver is responsible for converting most of your blood's oxygen-carrying components into usable fuels such as glucose, fatty acids, and proteins. To understand why some tissues require greater levels of oxygen than others, consider the example below. If we're talking about a person who weighs 200 pounds and runs on 1/2 his own weight, he would need about 60% of his body weight each day to carry oxygen around, just to keep his heart beating normally. But if we're talking about someone who weights only 20 pounds but runs on only 10% of his own weight, then he should not need 60% of his body weight each day, since he will get only 8% of all the oxygen needed to run his muscles and keep his heart beating naturally, while burning only 0.8 grams per minute of pure oxygen (a little over half of what he'd burn if he ran at 100% of his body weight). Therefore, he'll need 50% less of his total body weight each day to supply him with enough oxygen to stay alive. This is exactly what happens in type 1 diabetes, where the ability of our cells to pump out sufficient oxygen is impaired. Type 2 diabetes results in lower levels of oxygen consumption in some parts of the body because insulin fails to properly regulate the release of glucose into the bloodstream.",57,multiple sclerosis stages phases,-0.5075788497924805,2,question,1,0.00966183574879227,412,0

The clinical history in such cases is often extremely difficult to interpret; however, most clinicians believe that many neurologic symptoms arise from the central nervous system (CNS) infection.

Many clinicians will recommend that patients who develop a secondary progressive multiple sclerosis consider having their immune systems tested for infection, because such tests are often done early in the course of the disease.

Some patients also experience an increased risk for dementia because they are less likely to fall asleep at night due to lack of restorative sleep.

A number of research groups have studied sleep patterns in MS patients. In one such study of 60 MS patients, researchers found no significant differences in the levels of polysomnography data compared to controls. However, when their results were graphed on an hourly basis (a standard measure of sleep quality) the difference became apparent.

The study showed that MS patients had significantly more total minutes of wakefulness than controls. Interestingly, when these same volunteers were presented with a series of visual stimuli, those with MS had significantly fewer hours of total wakefulness overall. And when they viewed pictures related to memory or thinking, such as faces or letters, the differences disappeared. These findings suggest that MS patients' sleep is being compromised by changes in their circadian rhythm rather than REM sleep restriction.

Another study by Drs. Darryl Biernat and Stephen Ostrander from University College London examined 65 individuals with MS and 70 healthy controls. They analyzed participants' ratings of physical symptoms, including pain and stiffness, after taking blood pressure, heart rate and temperature measurements. The results demonstrated that while both MS groups reported some degree of daily pain during the day, there appeared to be a greater amount of chronic pain among MS patients than controls. Those with MS tended to report greater daily pain at night (even though both groups slept very little) and to suffer more frequent headache attacks while awake. This suggests that many MS patients suffer from chronic, unexplained and/or severe pain which may have a negative impact on performance throughout the day and into the evening.

This kind of evidence indicates that MS patients may be suffering from chronic pain disorders that could negatively affect their ability to perform. Even if you do not believe that your MS may be causing any pain, you should still understand that it may interfere with your ability to function effectively on a daily basis.

gpt2-large_79,"Yes. You may have multiple sclerosis if you develop the disease in your family. In order for your child or grandchildren to be affected by this condition, however, they must also have the disease. If it is unknown which parent(s) developed MS, and there are no siblings with the disease, then the children of both parents should not be affected. For information on determining a sibling's risk for developing MS, see Your Parent's Medical History.

Your health plan can tell you whether it covers any drugs that are specifically approved for treating MS. Some drug manufacturers offer generic versions of their products at a discount, so if you want to take an alternative medication or switch medications, talk to your provider about doing so.

What you need to know about prescription drugs You need to make sure you understand what type of drug you're taking before getting one. Read all the labels and instructions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how often you might get side effects and any possible interactions between different types of drugs. And check the label closely when changing medications to determine if you've been prescribed more than one treatment option. This includes new medicines (such as some over-the-counter and prescription medicine), vitamins, herbal supplements, dietary supplements, muscle relaxants, hormone treatments, blood pressure medications, allergy medicines, and surgical procedures.

Tennis Spinning Backward

Lie on your side with a pillow under your left arm. Place your hands behind your head so that they are on your thighs or knees. Start spinning around with your arms overhead until you feel like you're pulling yourself up. Keep your arms straight until you get to a point where you have lifted your legs off the floor. Then lower them down for 10-12 times. Repeat 3 times.

The first time I tried this exercise it didn't really work very well. The muscles didn't move very much at all because my shoulders were still pretty wide open. After some practice I found out that I had to use more of a downward motion than I was used to doing to get the most benefit from the exercise. For example, if the ball is rolled forward slightly then make sure to roll your hips outward rather than pushing hard with your elbows.

Spinal Twist

Stand upright with a foam roller under one shoulder and your other hand under your right knee. Lift your right leg up, keeping your heel flat against the surface of the ground. Now slowly bend over at the waist, bending the knee about 20 degrees. Hold this position for 1 second, then release and repeat 10 times.


Spinners


As you may be able to guess, these exercises aren't the easiest to do. But they don't require any special equipment (and should only take 15 minutes). To start off with, try doing each exercise for 20 seconds, then stop when you start feeling tired. Once you've done 30 reps, cut it short and go right into another set of 12 repetitions. It's also helpful to spend 2-3 sessions working each muscle group separately before trying to combine the workout. You'll probably find that you can't complete them at once so there must be a proper timing for each exercise.

Stretching Before & After Workouts

During workouts you will want to take care not to strain your muscles too badly by stretching after your workout. Here are a few tips to help you keep things nice and healthy during your workouts:

Keep your feet elevated when you're walking around on the treadmill. This will prevent you from running into obstacles.

1. I am a breast-cancer survivor who was treated with the hormone tamoxifen for several years, and it has been shown to increase my risk of having a breast-cancer recurrence in three different studies (P<0.05).


2. I have had four successful operations to remove my lymph nodes because they were no longer malignant. This is not an uncommon occurrence; only 2% of patients in my practice will have a single operation done to remove all their lymph nodes. The other 97% are left without any treatment or surgery to relieve this problem. My cancer may be very slow growing, but even if I do not need further treatments, it would still take me 10+ years of chemotherapy before I could possibly hope to feel comfortable going through it again. With that much time, I wouldn't want to wait any longer than necessary.


3. While I don't know how long I can live on the hormones, I'm pretty sure that I would die within a few months if the chemo doesn't work. It's so difficult to deal with the side effects, but what can you really expect from a drug that is killing your body? Not knowing is exhausting. At one point I couldn't sleep at night, I'd wake up feeling like vomiting or just want to get out of bed. You get used to the discomfort - which seems to come back every day - but it's enough to make you anxious. It makes me sad to think about how many people struggle so hard right now while waiting for a miracle cure.


4. What do you consider your ""normal"" life expectancy after being diagnosed with Stage IV metastatic breast cancer? If I am lucky, it might be around 50 years of age. But that's an average life span. For some women, that number is much lower (around 20), or even zero.


5. What is your plan for the future? Can I continue working as a stay-at-home mom and keep my family together as we battle this horrible disease? No matter how many surgeries I have or how good I feel about myself right now, I cannot allow my health to fail me completely by leaving it untreated.

I know you have been doing a lot of research lately so I thought we would talk about something that has come up over on Reddit. A lot of people are thinking about switching to Paleo (or other diet) for health reasons and they've found it very difficult to follow their old plans because they find themselves eating too many foods from the grocery store. Some people are going in and buying all sorts of new stuff with hopes of making them feel better, but it's kind of like trying to change your mind after having an affair: once you start eating that way, there's nothing stopping you! There isn't really any real evidence to back it up. Here are some links to some questions and answers related to this topic: What are my options for healthy nutrition? Paleo is the only ""natural"" diet/diet plan that's guaranteed to help your body grow. It works wonders for weight loss, hair growth, general well-being, and overall vitality. Can I do this without sacrificing quality? No. In fact, if you want good health, you'll need to improve the quality of the foods you eat. Do my kids need to stay home from school or work? Yes. For kids under 14 years old, most schools require your child to be home by 9pm, which means they will often eat before or while school starts. This makes working out a bit more challenging, and may cause your kids to burn off excess energy at bedtime instead of staying active throughout the day. Is there anything wrong with regular exercise? Not at all. If you can keep yourself fit, then exercising every single day won't hurt. Even if you don't exercise, keeping your blood pressure below 140 will help you lose weight quickly and effectively without the added strain. But even for us adults who aren't overly concerned with being in shape, moderate levels of physical activity can keep your blood pressure low enough that you can actually maintain your weight. Are there really no limits? Nope. Just as long as you limit what you consume, you should also avoid restricting calories, because your body produces more than enough glucose and insulin when you're burning fat and carbs together.

gpt2-large_53,"Psychotherapy is a form of therapy that focuses on the way we experience, understand and respond to our emotions, thoughts and actions. It can be used to help you deal with any problem or challenge you face in your life.

A great place to start with psychotherapy is with an individual therapist who has extensive experience working with children and young people. Some therapists will also provide a range of services including group sessions, couples therapies and parenting groups.

If you don't want to work through a formal counselling process with one particular practitioner, there are many other ways in which you might find support. For example, a friend, family member, social worker, clergyperson or carer could all offer their support, while online resources such as MeetUp groups or Facebook Groups may have resources available for those needing advice about issues around mental health or wellbeing.

Alternatively, if you're already experiencing some sort of distress, it's worth visiting the nearest GP clinic. You'll get the best results when you talk directly to a doctor (or nurse) rather than talking to someone else at the same time. If you need regular appointments, make sure that the appointment details are up-to-date.

Some forms of psychotherapy are offered by community mental health services or private clinics. These tend not to offer a specific service specifically tailored to adults, though they do often offer a wide variety of psychological treatments – from CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy), mindfulness meditation, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and exercise regimes to medication treatments like psychosurgery or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).

Myths:

Myth 1: I am not allergic to sugar and can eat as much as ever I am very healthy, my parents never made me eat junk food when they were alive. The only thing I'm allergic to is sugar, but in fact I don't have any type of allergies. I do suffer from a few other allergy problems that are usually caused by foods that contain refined sugars (sugar substitutes). My mom would tell me if something bad was happening, that I should try eating an apple or milk instead of junk food, which is why she had me on sugar-free diets when I was younger. It hasn't worked well for me yet, because I've found that many of those 'treatments' just make things worse! My mother and father never made me eat anything with added sugar so that I could be free from them for long periods of time without having to worry about being sick. They didn't give me a hard time about the occasional sugary treat, they simply said, ""You shouldn't drink this stuff at all, if it gets into your system, you'll get really ill."" I think it took quite some time before I finally got sick of all these treats. It sounds like a lot of people around here think that because my mom has never made me eat sugar I must be immune to it now. I don't believe her, and I know that there are plenty of people who will say they're immune, and then find out later, after years of eating the same junk food, that their immunity was no longer functioning properly. Even though my body doesn't react to sugar very well, it does react to most things. As long as the food itself isn't triggering any harmful reactions, I guess I am pretty safe, right? Well, not exactly. When it comes down to it, food poisoning is a serious issue. My doctor says that the risk of getting sick from food poisoning is 5% per year, and even when you factor in the possibility of dehydration, fever, vomiting, nausea, etc., it still stands at less than 1%. I realize this is probably too low, since we live in a world full of food poisoning disasters, but it still shows how dangerous it is, especially considering that I'm only 4 months old, and I've been sick for over 8 days.

The key to treating this disease is the removal of insulin from blood vessels and replacing it with glucose in the body. However, this process takes time. Insulin replacement therapy (insulin injections) is an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes but it takes approximately 3 months of continuous administration before the benefits become visible. The same is true when trying to treat other diseases like high cholesterol, hypertension, arthritis, cancer or even AIDS.

In some cases, it's because you're using too much weight on your back and your back is tired from sitting at a desk all day long. But if you're not getting enough sleep or are sleeping less than 8 hours per night, there could be other causes as well. If you have insomnia, you may experience chronic pain in the neck muscles that doesn't go away even after taking medicine.

Q: how to treat neck pain?

A: You should try to get plenty of rest while dealing with your neck pain. For example, take frequent naps whenever possible (especially when you're working out). The longer you stay asleep, the more likely it will become harder for you to sleep.

Doing regular stretches helps strengthen your spine and gives your neck muscle better circulation. Try standing up straight, holding one arm over your head with your elbow pointing downwards, and stretching yourself into a stretch position by keeping both arms bent at 90 degrees. Make sure you don't hold your breath as you bend your body!

Wearing compression stockings and wearing loose clothing during bedtime can help ease neck pain. A simple foam roller will give you support which can make an enormous difference. Be careful about the type of cushions you choose though; they tend to compress your skin and sometimes cause discomfort due to pressure points. Also remember to wear comfortable shoes and keep them dry; dampness increases tension and pain.

gpt2-large_126,"The data I'm seeing are that women on low-dose combined oral contraceptives (COCs) have about 1.5 to 2 microliters of a hormone in their blood per day, while those taking the lowest dose injectable forms of hormonal contraception (IUDs and implants) have about 0.6 to 0.8 milligrams. So for one month, you'll be getting about 3.3 to 5.2 micrograms of progesterone.

What's more, the researchers found that when it came to overall health outcomes, COC users were likely to live longer than nonusers—and there was no difference between male and female participants. For example, men with the highest levels of progesterone had an average lifespan six years longer than those without it.

There's also some evidence that a higher level of progesterone could decrease your risk of heart disease. It appears that high progesterone is associated with a lower incidence of coronary artery disease in women, says Dr. Gertrude Albrecht, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn. That means it may be possible to lower your risk if you're on COCs or another type of hormonal contraceptive.

But there's also plenty of evidence that a woman can get too much progesterone. Studies indicate that women who regularly use long-term hormonal contraceptives don't generally experience adverse side effects like breast enlargement or uterine bleeding. However, if you need regular doses of progestin to prevent pregnancy or you suffer from problems such as acne, excessive hair growth, and irregular periods, you may want to consider a different method.

Dr. Gertrude Albrecht has found that she often finds that older women, especially those with severe acne, tend not to benefit from the daily dose of progesterone.

It is very hard to get any rest at all during the week, which makes going to work even more difficult. So now I don't think of anything besides working in the morning. Also, if you have high blood pressure or heart disease, you may want to consider taking a medication called ezetimibe.

Q: Is it normal to have symptoms of PMS? Can I stop having them? Answer: Yes! There is absolutely no reason why you should ever have symptoms of PMS. When you're pregnant, your body produces hormones like prolactin and estrone that affect mood, appetite and menstrual cycle. However, these hormones usually decrease and return to baseline by 8 weeks postpartum. Symptoms of PMS include irritability, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and feelings of worthlessness. If these symptoms persist or worsen, call your physician immediately.

gpt2-large_83,"As far as I know, this is not something new to the medical community. It has been done for decades in various countries throughout history and even still today. In fact it was a treatment used in the past in both Europe and North America that helped people with Multiple Sclerosis to recover their function. It involved injecting certain substances into your bloodstream which increased the production of antibodies against some viruses, thus making them more effective at fighting off infections and helping you fight off disease. In other words, they were designed to help treat multiple sclerosis. In fact there are several studies from all over the world that have shown that these therapies actually work better than medicine itself! However, because these drugs are injected directly into your blood stream and can't be reversed once they're administered, many patients feel like they need to do something if they want to keep their condition in check. And what's more, many doctors don't understand how to prescribe or administer the drugs properly since they're often given on an outpatient basis. If you've ever had MS, then you'll know that taking medication every day may seem like a pain in the ass. This isn't true though; by taking medications regularly, you will build up an immunity that protects your body against harmful diseases. The more frequently your immune system attacks the pathogens in your body the less likely you are to experience flare ups, which makes it much easier to maintain your health, especially if your immune system is already strong enough to handle a virus outbreak. To clarify, the problem with the drug ""MS-001"" (also known as Relieve Me) is that there aren't any real treatments available to improve the quality of life and prevent relapses after someone gets an infection. There is no cure for MS; only a way to manage symptoms until they go away completely so you won't have to take any kind of meds again. Although it's possible that one could find a placebo effect to relieve the nausea/vomiting from MS sufferers' diarrhea, it wouldn't really matter since the medication would just make things worse instead of helping anyone feel better. But if you do want to try one of these drugs, then by all means make sure you follow the directions correctly. You will most certainly learn your lesson about taking an antibiotic daily and use a different antibiotic every two weeks (unless you think you may be having an immune response).

2. What do you need from me?\nThe following things should help make your life easier as a part-timer with MS or other chronic diseases: 1) A good relationship with your therapist; 2) An understanding that it's OK to ask about this kind of stuff; 3) Being able to give informed consent without feeling pressured to provide information or discuss issues that may conflict with my religious beliefs.

3. What if I can't afford to pay all of these things?\nFor example, what if you're making too much money or are struggling to get by financially? You might consider taking a leave of absence from your job or being flexible in how you take care of yourself to try to stay healthy during periods when it's hard to make ends meet. Alternatively, you could seek an unpaid internship. If you can't afford to travel overseas or out of state to find the training you need to practice medicine, your doctor will help you determine whether you'll need medical insurance to cover expenses such as health insurance, prescription drugs, and long-term disability payments (such as Social Security Disability Insurance). Medical bills often have to be paid before benefits begin, so finding ways to lower your monthly costs while saving up enough money to cover any future medical expenses will help keep you going in the long run. While there are some limitations on your ability to continue practicing medicine after leaving MS or another serious chronic disease, research suggests that even if you cannot continue working in full time, you likely will have more freedom than others with chronic illnesses to pursue hobbies or other interests outside of work hours.

What is the risk for postmenopausal depression in women who are at high risk of developing MS? There are no studies that show a link between estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) or estrogen-progestin combination therapy and depression. However, there is evidence that ERT and progestins can cause a decrease in mental health; therefore, if you take ERT or progestins as part of treatment for MS, it's important to talk about any changes in your behavior or thoughts because this could increase your risk of developing depression. If you're considering taking an estrogen supplement, it's important to discuss with your doctor whether these supplements should be taken while on MS medications like corticosteroids or insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). For example, when starting your first medication, you'll want to make sure you get enough of estrogen before getting off the medication so the hormone doesn't interfere with your treatment. Some other examples of treatments include exercise, nutritional counseling, and psychotherapy. Menopause symptoms, including amenorrhea or premenstrual syndrome, are common among women with MS but there is not much research available regarding their relationship to different forms of therapy such as estrogen replacement therapy or progesterone-only contraceptives (such as the birth control pill or intrauterine device [IUD]).

Are there any specific tests that can help diagnose MS? Yes. Currently there aren't many tests that identify people who have MS. The most commonly used test today is an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan. This type of MRI scans a person's brain using special images made from magnetic fields. MRI imaging shows abnormalities associated with various diseases and conditions. A detailed description of each test is given below: Brain Tumor Detection Test – this test measures the size of a tumor in the person's brain. It may also look at whether the cancer has spread beyond the area where it was found and what drugs were used to treat it.

gpt2-large_1,"The primary causes of disease in people are genetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle. There is no single cause of all diseases. Each person's genetic makeup creates specific risk factors that increase their risk.

One of the key characteristics of chronic conditions is that they persist for a long time after symptoms appear. When you read about a new syndrome such as Alzheimer's Disease or multiple sclerosis, it can be hard to accept that something has gone wrong with your body so quickly. That's why I want you to think critically before you start thinking, ""I'm going crazy."" You're not crazy. Even if your doctor says you've got the flu, don't panic—the virus will pass through and make its way into other parts of your body and eventually affect brain cells and even kill them!\nSome diseases, like diabetes, aren't reversible once you get sick and there isn't a cure. Other chronic illnesses, like cancer, can have serious complications if left untreated. But what if we could reduce the amount of suffering caused by these debilitating disorders? A new generation of drugs could help us prevent many of these conditions from becoming permanent. So what makes an illness a chronic one? It's the same thing as an old-fashioned disease: If it doesn't go away on its own, then it is a chronic condition.\nWhen you think of an illness, think of it in terms of how often it occurs over time. Chronic conditions arise when certain tissues begin to change, which damages healthy tissue and may lead to physical damage. For example, some cancers develop when there is inflammation (or angiogenesis) of healthy blood vessels. Acute infections may trigger chronic disease in the respiratory tract, and some autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis may result from changes in immune system function. People who are at high risk for developing chronic diseases are those who: smoke cigarettes; are overweight or obese; have heart or kidney problems; suffer from hypertension or uncontrolled diabetes; use alcohol; take medications that alter hormones; have a family history of cancer or AIDS; or have been diagnosed with major depression or bipolar disorder. \nIf you fall into any of these categories, consider getting screened for these conditions and see a physician immediately if you notice any signs or symptoms of chronic pain, joint pain, muscle aches, mental confusion, loss of appetite, headaches, fatigue, joint swelling, night sweats, or unexplained weight gain.

They can however be easily removed with an ordinary dental drill, but it takes more than one bite of a tooth to break the tooth enamel. A simple procedure to remove these could also be used at home for free with no risk of infection.

Q: What should I do when my tooth becomes so worn out that I have to have it replaced? Answer: If you suspect any decay or problems with your tooth (such as cavities) then you need to see your dentist in order for your teeth to be fixed properly. After being treated by your dentist you will still want to follow the steps outlined below to ensure they do work before having them replaced.

1) Remove the hard part of the tooth with a toothpick. Using a clean knife cut around the damaged area where the tooth has become soft. Use a toothbrush to gently scrub off any debris left behind. This allows air and water to pass through, which helps restore dentin and prevents future damage.

2) Place the tooth into hot running tap water and allow it to soak for about 30 minutes. To prevent further damage to the tooth, place a piece of plastic wrap on top of the tooth and wrap tightly around the tooth to keep out dirt and foreign matter. Once cleaned, wash the new tooth well, using mild soap to get rid of any abrasive substances and then rinsing thoroughly under warm running tap water. If you have had previous infections, avoid using antibacterial mouthwash and use regular oral hygiene products.

3) Replace the tooth with fresh toothpaste. Allow a minimum of 10 days between every treatment (this may vary depending on the type of tooth and how long it has been sitting there). This should reduce any irritation that occurs during the brushing process and make sure that all tissues are fully lubricated.

4) Apply gentle heat to the tooth after each rinse. The skin around the inside of the gums needs protection against bacterial growth to help prevent it becoming infected, therefore applying warmth directly to the gums, particularly if they are moist, should immediately bring relief. You could also use a circular heating pad on the front of the tooth, positioned just under the gum line. Simply rub this over the affected areas. It should take only a few seconds to activate heat and provide immediate relief to relieve discomfort. Always consult your doctor before attempting to treat any existing issues.",105,wisdom tooth cuts gum pain,-11.71851634979248,56,question,2,0.7088607594936709,438,14

The main advantage of the ketogenic diet is that it allows you to focus on improving your physical health and overall wellbeing without suffering from malnutrition or hunger. It also enables you to eat more complex carbohydrates – such as those found in most starchy foods - when compared to an ordinary high-carbohydrate diet, which may lead to weight gain.

I'm going through my ketosis phase. What should I do now?

The best thing to do at this point is stay active – take regular walks, exercise regularly, keep some healthy snacks on hand etc. If you have been able to stick to your prescribed diets, then by all means continue to do so. However, if you are feeling depressed, anxious, agitated, unwell, tired, sick, weak, etc., then things are really getting out of control. This can be frustrating, because there's nothing quite like being faced with a choice between eating and taking medication. The solution? Stop eating and medicate yourself!\r

What can go wrong during ketosis?

This depends on what stage you're currently at. \r

If you've just started off from scratch (no prior experience), then the immediate effects can include depression, anxiety, headache, muscle aches and pains, lethargy, weakness, fatigue, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms usually subside within 24 hours, although they will often return after a day or two. As you progress through your own process of ketosis, these symptoms begin to lessen considerably over time. After 2-3 weeks of full ketosis, the symptoms typically recede completely. A few individuals remain ill, however, and some individuals develop complications related to their condition that require medical intervention. This can range from mild cases of hypoglycaemia, to severe cases where blood glucose levels drop below 140 mg/dL and require intensive treatment such as insulin therapy.\r

In a similar way, ketones are released in response to fasting, which helps stimulate the metabolism. However, ketones don't carry any beneficial benefits for those who aren't following a strict protocol. That said, they provide some support to patients whose immune systems have become compromised. As ketones release naturally, this has been shown to help alleviate both inflammation and infection. Additionally, low fat diets can cause side effects such as stomach upset,",35,Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?,-4.899362087249756,26,question,2,0.16774193548387098,385,12

There is no way to know what causes hair loss due to hair follicles dying, but there have been reports that people who use too much or long-term hair removal products also suffer from hair loss.

How to treat hair loss from your scalp?

In general, topical treatments can help reduce the pain caused by hair loss from your scalp. They do include creams and lotions which contain antihistamines, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen or aspirin, which help stop the release of histamine into your body. These products should only be used for short periods of time because they can cause dry patches that tend to last longer than 1 week. If your hair is very thin, especially on your head, it might need treatment more often depending on the severity of the hair loss.

Hair therapy works best when you choose a salon and the right therapist. You'll probably want to work closely with one who has experience in treating hair loss and knows how to manage the different aspects of hair growth. Many therapists will prescribe a variety of prescription hair treatments based on your needs and lifestyle. You could find an affordable prescription cream, gel or spray that contains salicylic acid at a drugstore. In case the salon doesn't stock these products, they can be found online in specialised websites and even in some specialist shops.

Your doctor will usually suggest the type of therapy you need for your specific situation. A combination of oral corticosteroids, steroids and salicylic acid treatments are generally used to relieve chronic inflammation of the scalp. Dermatologists also recommend the use of medication such as isotretinoin and minocycline to treat acne and scleroderma (ringing between your eyes), although this is controversial since there aren't any approved drugs approved for those conditions yet.

What is holistic medicine in the context of human health? \nHealth is more than just a medical term; it has many meanings such as ""whole-person"" or ""being whole"".\n

Healthcare systems often have different goals and goals vary greatly between countries. For example, U.S. healthcare is very competitive, and people pay for services based on their personal beliefs. In Europe, however, there are no such restrictions. If you have high-risk conditions, even if you don't want to see your doctor, you can pay your way through your insurance company's network. Healthcare companies offer free or low-cost preventive and wellness care to everyone who needs it. Many countries also offer both Medicare coverage and private insurance to those with lower incomes. Medicare allows patients to receive financial assistance to help cover out-of-pocket costs for medications and procedures that are too expensive for most Americans to afford alone. The European system provides comprehensive coverage but requires beneficiaries to meet certain requirements, including maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, eating clean meals, and avoiding smoking.

What types of holistic doctors exist throughout Europe? \nIn Europe, conventional primary care physicians are required by law to practice holistic medicine. Traditional medicine practitioners often use herbal remedies, homeopathy, acupuncture, chiropractic therapy, osteopathic manipulation, and other forms of alternative medicine when treating symptoms or injuries. Some traditional medicines might be considered complementary because they do not contain any pharmaceutical ingredients. Alternative treatments may work best when combined with traditional therapies.\n

For some patients, the combination of medical interventions can produce results that conventional medicine could never provide. These are known as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). CAM uses natural and/or scientific approaches to treat illnesses. There are several CAM providers throughout Europe and practitioners frequently use different methods.

There are several reasons why people choose to use a particular form of medicine. They may believe that this is an effective treatment or that it will improve their overall quality of life. However, these choices aren't necessarily linked to how well the treatments actually work. Some people choose to rely primarily on CAM treatments to ease their pain or anxiety. Others may simply prefer the comfort of having an alternative form of medicine available to them. In either case, however, a physician must evaluate each patient's individual circumstances before recommending a specific type of treatment.

As a matter of fact, some CAM programs focus on certain parts",51,What is holistic medicine and what does it include?,-0.834732711315155,10,question,2,0.053475935828877004,411,28

B. There is a high degree of difficulty maintaining interpersonal relationships with other people.

C. The person's sense of self-worth is severely diminished.

D. There is an extreme need for control over one's life (e.g., work, finances) and/or personal relationships.

E. Although the person seems capable of functioning independently, they display signs of poor judgment, impulsivity, lack of empathy, egocentricity, and inattentiveness.


3.) Is a diagnosis made when a person has any of these problems?


Yes. When there is an overt pattern of behavior that is consistent with the criteria above, you will likely receive a diagnosis of BPD. If your partner displays borderline traits, it may be necessary to seek help from a licensed mental health professional who specializes in treating BPD.

How can I tell if someone has BPD?


The classic way to distinguish between borderline and non-borderline traits in a person is by asking yourself what you would do if you encountered these two opposite personality traits simultaneously. It should be obvious that there are certain characteristics that borderlines share with other types of personality disorder (but not all), such as dissociation, fantasy, self-absorption, and narcissism. Additionally, some of those features, like depression or anxiety, only manifest themselves at times of great stress or crisis within a relationship. Others, including paranoia or mood disorders (including manic-depressive syndrome [manic-depression] and major depressive disorder [MDD]), are more common in borderline individuals than in non-borderline people. But unlike other personality disorder diagnoses, borderline individuals typically don't meet diagnostic criteria until around age 30. This means it is very possible for someone to start out as a diagnosed borderline and then become otherwise healthy and happy in another context.",114,borderline personality disorder symptoms,-0.1158735454082489,13,question,2,0.12037037037037036,327,14
gpt2-large_85,"The most common cause of relapses in MS is the presence of a neurodegenerative disease. A neurologist may recommend surgery to relieve symptoms, although many people are successfully treated with drugs such as oral or transdermal steroids. Other factors that can contribute to relapses include an abnormal immune response to medication, an exacerbation of symptoms after treatment has ended and/or severe head trauma (e.g., motor vehicle accidents) that leads to recurrent infections.

Q: What is autologous stem cell transplant?\nA: Autologous stem cell transplant is when someone who has had MS for at least 6 months receives bone marrow cells from another person. This allows patients to avoid all other types of transplants as well as any risks associated with existing graft-versus-host disease. Bone marrow donors can come from the family members of the patient, friends or coworkers.

Q: How does autologous stem cell transplant work? Can I have both autologous and bone marrow transplants?\nA: Yes! Autologous transplant occurs when a donor's bone marrow cells are removed from his body through surgery and then taken into the recipient's body. The patient would receive a transplant of these donor cells under general anesthesia using a process similar to giving blood transfusions or receiving injections of immunosuppressive medications. There are several procedures required before autologous transplant begins; this includes testing and preoperational follow-up visits. Blood samples must be drawn prior to treatment. After completion of the initial procedure, a total of 5 days will pass before tissue samples are collected for further analysis. Because this test is done on the outside of the arm, no one should know if the patient has received autologous transplant until after treatment is completed. If the sample shows no signs of rejection, it is considered positive and autologous transplant will begin. If there is resistance (i.e., the patient develops inflammation or immune system problems), the patient will need to wait longer before being given the new transplanted cells.

Q: Is autologous stem cell transplant safe and effective? Does it require additional treatments?\nA: No. In fact, autologous transplant is only performed in selected patients at specific centers around the country. It is possible to die during autologous transplant, but patients usually recover completely within 2 years. Most people who undergo autologous transplant do not develop complications, though some patients experience significant disability and others experience long-term disability.

gpt2-large_123,"Yes, the doctor will determine whether you are experiencing a thyroid problem. Your body is unable to produce enough thyroid hormone by itself and it's called hypo-thyroidism. The good news is that your body can be made aware of any problems. In fact, if it does not respond appropriately to treatment with T4, your doctor may suggest an increased dose of T3 to see what effect this has on your condition.

Hypothyroidism Symptoms

The most common type of hypothyroidism is undiagnosed or underdiagnosed; i.e., someone who isn't sure about their diagnosis because they don't feel like they have anything wrong. People with undiagnosed hypothyroidism may experience fatigue, weight loss, depression, memory impairment, lack of energy, irregular menstrual periods, low libido, changes in appetite, irritability, loss of hair, dry skin, difficulty concentrating, headaches, muscle pain, joint pains, insomnia and other symptoms.

Symptoms of undiagnosed hypothyroidism include:

Fatigue, feeling tired all the time

Loss of interest/memory

Decreased strength and stamina

Insomnia

Headaches

Depression, mood swings, sadness and feelings of worthlessness

Joint pain

Muscle weakness

Slow growth (due to decreased sex drive)

Mood swings

Low body temperature (or hot flashes)

Muscle aches

Weight loss

Poor concentration

When the doctor suspects that you might be suffering from a thyroid disorder, he or she may perform some tests including blood work, blood pressure, urine analysis and liver function testing. These tests reveal the exact cause of the symptoms for those with undiagnosed hypothyroidism.

If the test results show that there is a problem with your thyroid gland, then the doctor may prescribe an over the counter thyroid medication, such as Levothyroxine (also known as L-Tylenol). This medication increases the production of thyroglobulin and T4 in your body to help regulate the thyroid gland. If you take T4 alone, the levels in your bloodstream are too high and cause you to experience symptoms similar to those experienced by people without hypothyroidism. However, if you do have severe low levels of T4, your doctor should evaluate you closely.

So it takes time for you to be able to become the best possible person who can help your patient heal. This can take years, or even decades. Most of us will have to do this on our own, but I am here today to give you some tips. The key is for you to find out what works best for you, and then make sure you're doing all you can to get better.


SOME OF THE TIP SHEETS BELOW WILL HELP YOU LEARN HOW TO DO THIS...

1. Start by getting to know your symptoms: If you can't see anything in specific areas of your brain, and you don't have any symptoms of MS other than fatigue, pain, depression, poor vision or loss of muscle function, you may not be suffering from this disease. There are many things you can try to increase your quality of life if you feel the same way. If you want to go deeper into why you think you might be having these feelings, read my post below titled 'Practical Tips for Managing Multiple Sclerosis Symptoms'.


2. Use a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) technique when dealing with the thoughts of others. For example, use this exercise on yourself. Notice how your mind thinks about things like your doctor, friends, family, work, job and finances, etc. When you notice that there isn't an immediate logical reason as to why something is happening to you, ask yourself questions like ""what do I really need right now?"" or ""why am I feeling this way?"". If you can answer those questions honestly, you may actually be changing the thoughts in your mind, making them easier to change. You can also practice this by using a CBT tool such as this one. Just remember to always tell people who ask you these kinds of questions that you are being honest.


3. Consider the role you play in people's lives. It is very difficult to deal with a disorder that affects everyone so deeply, especially when it impacts your everyday lives. If your spouse or partner has been diagnosed with MS, you might wish to talk about their symptoms with them before you have to go to visit them. It would be helpful to say something along the lines of ""it is hard to watch as you work day after day, knowing how much effort each one of you put in for us"".

gpt2-large_92,"It is not an easy disease to treat. It has multiple causes and there is no one single cause that can be identified for all cases or even those who have a mild form of the illness. The most common cause is sleep deprivation, though sometimes this factor is not so obvious (some studies show that patients with high blood pressure are more likely to report fatigue).

A variety of other factors may contribute as well, including stress, alcohol and medication use, all of which increase the risk of developing fatigue over time.

Many medications used to control symptoms also increase your risk of having the same problem over time. For example, antidepressants can decrease your ability to recover from fatigue and they increase the chances that you'll continue to experience it throughout your life. This is especially true if you take them for insomnia or depression because both of these conditions affect your recovery from fatigue.

If you do decide to try some form of treatment for MS at home or on-site, ask your doctor about what he/she considers safe, effective and suitable. Try to find out from your physician whether you should take any other medications besides those listed above. If you're taking antifungals or antihistamines, be sure to check with your doctor before changing any part of their regimen.

Q: Can I go back to working? A: Yes! Most people who have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis can return to work after a year or two without significant problems. In fact, many return to work within six months of diagnosis. Some experts think that you can be returned to normal activity by about 18 months after being diagnosed; others suggest a longer period.

However, it's important to remember that returning to your old job will require extra commitment, possibly involving changes in your lifestyle.

A secondary progressive multiple sclerosis is a disease that strikes patients with progressive multiple sclerosis who are unable to self-administer their anti-MS medication, either because of severe liver and kidney failure or complications from the disease itself. The number of cases of such secondary progressive multiple sclerosis has been increasing in recent years, but there have not yet been sufficient studies on the role of anti-MS medications in this situation.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of rituximab (ritonavir) on the rate of progression of primary progressive MS and the risk of developing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis compared to placebo. Thirty-nine patients were randomized into two groups (placebo; n = 17), one receiving rituximab (5 mg/day) and the other placebo (n = 12). These patients received monthly injections for 6 months followed by 1 year follow-up. The primary endpoint was the time to first clinical relapse within 5 years after initiation of treatment. Patients were evaluated at baseline and at each visit thereafter for improvement, and they underwent MRI scans every 2 weeks during the follow-up period. A second primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of new or worsening symptoms within 10 years of initiating treatment. After adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index, rituximab significantly reduced the rates of clinical relapses and increased the risk of developing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. In addition, both groups experienced statistically significant improvements over placebo. The combined results suggest that rituximab may reduce the incidence of progression of primary progressive multiple sclerosis.",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-0.0043845474720001,0,question,2,0.0,256,21
gpt2-large_93,"Yes. We know that MS is associated with sleep disturbance, so it makes sense to look at this condition as a risk factor for memory problems.\r

Sleep disorders such as insomnia, which are common among older adults, can cause problems with attention and concentration; however, sleep problems may also play a role in the development of MS. For instance, one study found that poor sleep quality was an independent predictor of disease progression.\r

MS is usually diagnosed during early adulthood, when the symptoms are typically mild. At first, patients may be confused about what to do—they're not sure they have MS or why their MS doesn't go away. Some people get relief from medication, but some require more sophisticated treatment plans. One method used by physicians today is called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This approach involves identifying specific triggers for symptoms and addressing them through training. It's important that these strategies aren't limited to just focusing on how bad your life has been lately.

How Can Multiple Sclerosis Affect Your Health? \r

Multiple sclerosis affects each nerve cell differently. Symptoms vary depending upon where each nerve cell resides in the body.\r

When a nerve cell is damaged, pain, numbness, muscle weakness or other abnormal sensations occur. In addition, nerve cells often die. These processes result in symptoms like headaches, fatigue, dizziness, seizures, loss of balance and involuntary movements.\r

Treatment Options for Multiple Sclerosis \r

There are several ways to treat MS. Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments specifically designed to help improve symptoms in older adults. However, many doctors believe that these drugs could help reduce MS symptoms and function. The most effective options include medications that block the inflammation caused by the immune system, corticosteroids, which target the immune system, and physical exercise.\r

Medications That Block Inflammation \r

NSAIDs, commonly known as over-the-counter pain relievers, work by inhibiting prostaglandins, which stimulate the production of white blood cells, causing pain. They don't actually directly affect MS symptoms, since NSAID use isn't intended to relieve pain. They were developed decades ago as painkillers for arthritis.\r

However, studies suggest that over-the-counter NSAIDS may worsen myelin sheaths, which connect axons within neurons. When axons become",93,Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?,-0.0071340827271342,0,question,2,0.0,377,27
gpt2-large_72,"Yes, it is effective. The vaccine is also available in generic form without the high price tag of a licensed product. This means that if you are on an MS drug and want to buy the Covid-19 vaccine or another one which contains a similar antigen, you can get them at very low prices from local pharmacies.

What does this mean for patients with other autoimmune diseases besides MS (such as lupus)?

The answer depends on whether the disease involved affects only the CNS or also involves all body systems. If the disease involves the entire body system, then your immune system will be weakened by using both corticosteroids and anti-inflammatory agents. This may result in an increased risk for infections and adverse reactions. On the other hand, in the case of autoimmune diseases that affect just a specific part of the nervous system – such as lupus, where there is no central nervous system involvement whatsoever, then your immune system will still benefit from the immunosuppressive drugs provided by the manufacturer, which is why the vaccines contain an additional component called Cefotaxime, which blocks the binding of certain proteins to the receptors, thus preventing the production of antibodies which would target the brain and spinal cord. For those cases where the entire CNS is affected, however, the vaccines provide no additional protection since they do not block the normal functioning of the immune system. Therefore, the vaccines should not be considered as alternative treatment options for the treatment of any autoimmune diseases.

Do you need to take the injections every day during treatment?

No, the injections are given once daily throughout treatment. However, if you are concerned about your health, make sure that you follow up with your doctor before starting therapy so that he/she knows how much you have been injected. In addition, check with your insurance provider regarding reimbursement of these treatments.

What are the risks associated with the vaccination process?

There are many possible side effects related to the vaccinations, including allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis and hepatitis B. Most commonly, the injection is given via a needle or capsule (often referred to as a shot). If you experience problems after receiving the shots, consult your doctor immediately and seek medical attention. A recent study found that 30% of patients who received the vaccine developed post-immunization syndrome (PIS) within six months post immunization. People who develop PIS tend to suffer from fatigue and headaches. Additionally, some studies suggest that the virus could be transmitted to others through the saliva of",72,Is the Covid-19 vaccine safe for people taking multiple sclerosis drugs?,-0.0169864762574434,21,question,2,0.09859154929577464,424,49
gpt2-large_79,"Yes. The physician who has the authority to give a diagnosis or treatment in the case of any person under 18 years old must be informed that one parent may have multiple sclerosis and the other parent cannot. If neither parent is currently receiving care for MS, the parent(s) having the disease should take responsibility for monitoring for possible complications resulting from the pregnancy, including adverse effects on children, until such time as an appropriate medical professional can make a determination about whether there are problems with the child's development. However, it does not matter if both parents have multiple sclerosis—as long as one parent has multiple sclerosis, and the other parent doesn't.

Can my spouse or partner also get multiple sclerosis?

If you have co-morbidity (health conditions), such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease or cancer, all your potential partners will need to be evaluated in order to determine what they might be able to do to help you deal with the symptoms and signs of multiple sclerosis. A screening test is available at no cost that identifies people who could potentially become pregnant while carrying multiple sclerosis symptoms. It requires blood tests which generally take 2 weeks after starting treatment to see if the abnormal results indicate a fetus with multiple sclerosis. Some women have reported finding their urine containing elevated levels of antibodies against multiple sclerosis (molecular mimicry). These levels can then be used to evaluate the likelihood of a miscarriage or stillbirth (see ""Miscarriage risk"").

What are the symptoms of MS?

The most common symptom of MS is fatigue, but the disease may cause headaches, weakness, muscle pain, numbness or tingling sensations around joints, and trouble seeing clearly. Other symptoms include eye changes, cognitive dysfunction, depression, and vision loss. In some cases, patients develop MS when symptoms occur more than once per week and/or the disease progresses rapidly. Patients experience worsening and/or worsening of symptoms over time and can present with multiple neurological disorders. The overall prognosis for people with MS depends on many factors, including age, education level, gender, race, disability status, family history, severity of MS, and treatment response. People with MS face significant challenges, often including finding housing, work, and access to health care services. Many patients receive little assistance in paying their bills or saving money in order to live independently. They're often denied employment opportunities because of their MS. They're often forced to move away from their home town because of lack of transportation and other obstacles.

Q: is this safe?

A: Yes! This drug has been studied for over 30 years and it does not cause any side effects or harm to the body.

Q: when will I start taking Proteuson?

A: It takes 2 weeks after starting treatment before you can start your dosage. After that time period you should stop taking it if you are doing well. The dose is increased every 3 months.

Q: I am being treated with this drug and my symptoms don't improve. What can we do?

A: If your symptoms only worsen, then you can try an alternative drug which may be even better at improving symptoms. You may also want to see your doctor because some people have developed serious side effects as a result of using this drug without a prescription.

Q: My symptoms get worse after stopping the medicine. Is this normal?

A: It's possible that the medication caused the problem. There isn't much you can do about the situation. However, you can try changing the method of administration so that you take less of the pill per day, or maybe switching from one brand to another. You might also consider going home for a while and seeing what happens to your condition.

Q: Why did you choose to use Proteuson in this way?

A: We decided that patients would experience more positive results from Proteuson therapy than they do from conventional therapy because of its anti-cancer properties. To make sure that the patient actually got the benefits he was hoping for, we started by combining the drug with radiation therapy (a procedure used in many cancers) and chemotherapy drugs (such as carboplatin).

Q: How long should I keep taking Proteuson?

A: Take it as often as recommended, but just don't exceed the prescribed amount or follow any specific instructions, especially if you're pregnant or nursing. Your doctor or pharmacist may tell you how often to change the dose, or give you other information.

Is there a way to view all stages?

Yes, but it can be cumbersome and time consuming. There are three ways to view all stages within an individual doctor visit; online, on your computer, and using our mobile app. You will have access to these methods for both the in-office physical exam and the electronic examination. If you use one method, please select ""View as much information"" option from the drop down menu at the top of the screen (in my opinion this is more accurate). The electronic examination does not contain information regarding the stage(s) of each tumor. It only displays the grade of the primary treatment used. This grade is based on the number of cells that were examined by the physician during the exam. For example, if the grade of the primary treatment was 6/12, then the grades would be 0–3, 4–6, 7–9, 10–14, 15–19, 20+. These grades range from A (Grade 9) through F (Grade 13). The table below summarizes the grading system by primary treatment used by Dr. Koonin: Grade 1: Primary treatment used by the majority of the doctors in the United States (i.e., most major hospitals, clinics, etc.)

Grade 2: Secondary care physicians' use of primary treatments

Grade 3: Physicians' use of secondary treatments in combination with primary treatment

Grade 4: Other doctors' use of primary treatments Grade 5: Doctors who use alternative medicine, including alternative therapies (e.g., acupuncture, chiropractic, herbalism, naturopathy) and herbal preparations (e.g., supplements such as vitamin C, selenium, vitamins B1, B2, and E)

Grade 6: Physicians who prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

Q: how do I eat to burn more calories? A: If you want to burn more calories than what you would normally expend in any given day, it's very simple: keep your food intake relatively low; eat fewer calories when you're hungry. (For example, if you're eating breakfast at 5am then eat no more than 2,000 calories throughout the day.)

What are the benefits of LCHF? For some people, consuming less energy means they can eat fewer calories overall. It may even give them more control over their weight, as well as more time to enjoy life.

In the mid-1990s, an article in The Lancet reported that an experimental drug could bring down blood sugar levels. However, it was only for people with Type 2 diabetes and there were still many questions about whether this treatment would work for everyone. Researchers found that people who took the drug had lower blood sugars than those who did not take the drug. These results proved that the therapy worked; however, there were some concerns about long term effects on health.

There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. People with type 1 diabetes usually eat too much carbohydrates and their blood glucose level increases, which causes blood vessels to constrict and leads to inflammation. They also develop complications such as heart disease and kidney problems. Although these complications are less common among people living with type 2 diabetes, they can occur if they don't manage their condition. In addition, it's important to note that patients with type 2 diabetes have reduced insulin sensitivity and are more likely to experience low body weight (which is one of the most important factors contributing to obesity). It is also possible that lifestyle changes might help to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes over time, though further research will need to confirm this.",45,Can diabetes be cured?,-0.0112060690298676,2,question,2,0.015873015873015872,252,7

gpt2-large_112,"Symptoms of asthma are caused by an immune response to the foreign substance, and can be treated with a drug called inhaled corticosteroids. The medication is taken for short periods (i.e., every 3-7 days), usually daily. Some people may need a different treatment method if they have severe or chronic asthma that persists into adulthood. In cases where there's no current therapy available, a steroid inhaler should be used as part of your care plan, particularly in children younger than age 7 years.

There are several types of steroids:

Oral corticosteroid (OC) drugs - These are approved medications that contain high levels of steroid hormones. They're prescribed to treat conditions such as asthma and allergies. Oral corticosteroid medications include olanzapine, lansoprazole, and prednisone. OTC versions of these medications also are available.

Dosage of oral corticosteroid medications varies depending on the disease. For example, some people who take oral corticosteroids for asthma may not need more than 50 mg of OC per day; others may need higher doses or longer durations. Other times, however, oral steroid medications may not help at all when prescribed according to the label instructions. The manufacturer will give you a prescription form (recommended dose schedule). If you don't follow this information, your doctor could prescribe the wrong dosage or possibly recommend another type of medication.

Lisinertide - Another common oral steroid used to treat asthma is levitra injection. This medication contains less potent steroid hormones than oral corticosteroids. It works well only for patients with asthma whose asthma worsens after taking other medicine for their condition. You can get levitra through your health care provider. Most people using this medication do so because it has been recommended or prescribed by their doctor for the condition. While it may improve asthma symptoms in some individuals, levitra does not cure the condition. Many people with asthma are put off using this medication because they think it'll cause side effects, especially heart problems.

Q: What is a relapse?\nA: A relapse occurs when there are signs or symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, irritability, pain, blurred vision or other symptoms associated with a medical condition. These can include headaches, loss of muscle strength, changes in bowel habits, diarrhea, constipation, joint pains, etc. If you want to learn about how MS works, see this article. \nIf your doctor says something seems wrong, ask him/her for help finding out what's going on.

gpt2-large_77,"The two are not related, because the symptoms of MS differ in severity. If one is more severe than the other, then it may be difficult for a woman with MS or women who have MS to get and maintain an appointment with their neurologist. In addition, women with MS typically experience worse moods and greater emotional distress than those without MS; thus, they can often suffer from depression and poor well-being that interfere with participation in MS care.

Q: What is the best method of preventing recurrence of my autoimmune disease after treatment with an immunotherapy drug? \nAnswer: A study published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) shows that the most effective prevention strategy against recurrent MS recurrences involves adherence to a regimen of immune-suppressing medications including drugs such as interferon beta and human papillomavirus (HPV). At least three months prior to initiating therapy, women should be screened for serologic evidence of active MS according to a validated protocol. Women treated with interferon beta are recommended to take this medication on a daily basis until at least 3 months after stopping treatment if they remain healthy. HPV has also been shown to prevent recurrence of various autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis. Patients diagnosed with HIV infection should continue taking this medication during treatment with an antiviral agent, such as azithromycin. Finally, patients with other systemic conditions (such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, liver dysfunction, or stroke), pregnant women, young children, and persons with certain psychiatric disorders should consult their physician regarding treatment options.

However, we don't know how soon these changes will manifest themselves and what type of rehabilitation is required.

Q: Do my cognitive deficits change when I'm older? \nAnswer: Yes, older adults with MS experience cognitive decline and lower levels of intelligence, but they still exhibit normal learning capabilities.

Many people are concerned with health problems in their family members but the reality is that they are not really sick themselves; they were just affected by the situation of those around them. For example, it might occur that one member of your family was suffering from diarrhea at some time. It is unlikely that he would become ill himself unless you suddenly put him on a fast, for instance, but his family has been complaining bitterly and you made them feel so bad that they went to bed hungry. And when they wake up the next morning and find their children all crying out for food, they cannot imagine how you could possibly have done that! So, the symptoms are probably nothing to get upset about, except that they might make you think twice before eating something else. When you are concerned about a health problem in someone in your own family, ask yourself whether you might be able to help your loved one. Some possible options include: • Paying attention to the condition of your spouse or partner. If she is experiencing difficulties while you work, it might be worth paying attention to her and trying to help her improve. Some good sources of information are available through medical associations, local newspapers, magazines, and Web sites. This information should help you evaluate the seriousness of her problem or even suggest ways that she might better manage it. In addition, if you can't pay close attention to someone else in your family, try paying more attention to yourself. This usually means having a regular checkup, going to the doctor regularly, and avoiding smoking and alcohol. Even though these activities won't always solve all your health problems, doing them every day can make a big difference.

Dear Ms. Schafer:

I recently went through a difficult period during which my body began to fail me. After five weeks, I was admitted to the hospital, given morphine, and given 10 days to live. During these days, I developed extreme muscle weakness, and in addition, I experienced frequent and excruciating pain. I was in pain every single day; at times I would literally sit down and cry. My body could no longer function. There were no doctors available to assist me in managing my pain. To add insult to injury, I discovered that I couldn't even eat because there was nothing left to digest. When I was admitted to the ICU, the doctor instructed me that if I could not eat within 5 days, they would begin to administer morphine. Unfortunately, my husband became ill shortly after that and had to go into surgery immediately. Since then, my weight has dropped precipitously; I have lost 30 pounds since being discharged from the hospital and am now down to 180 pounds.

On Monday afternoon of January 7th, 2016, I decided to take matters into my own hands by having my boyfriend drive me home from work. When he arrived, I knew something wasn't right.

Question: What is the difference between a yoga and meditation practice? Answer: meditation, which involves breathing, moving through space, and focusing on feelings in order to overcome stress and anxiety, has been described as an exercise that helps us develop certain mental skills. Yoga is similar but does not require any particular technique or form of movement. It is more of a way of being with the body rather than as a separate activity. You can do it in bed or while you are waiting for the bus or walking around on a sunny day. The main thing is that you pay attention and be aware of what's happening inside.

Question: how can I get started? Answer: Start by doing some simple poses with your partner. These are called postures of the torso (pranayama) and head (viparita). They will help improve your posture and work on balancing yourself. Then try out different positions: lying down or sitting up; standing, kneeling, standing with one leg bent at the knee, sitting on a chair or floor, lying on your back or on your side. This exercise gives you an opportunity to work on balance and flexibility. Also try practicing walking backward from your starting point instead of forward. Practice it gradually and slowly until you feel comfortable. If there are many people working together, you may need several sessions before you can see a noticeable improvement. Don't go overboard though! Try to focus only on a few poses each time so you don't become bored after just a few minutes.

The other is when you have to pick up a heavy object and suddenly the back of your hand feels numb or even as if something has fallen out of it. It's caused by the loss of blood that normally comes from the arteries and veins in the hands. If you don't get enough blood flow to the area, it can cause an inflammation, causing the pain.The most common causes for these kinds of wrist problems are: poor posture, poor sleep, low testosterone levels, diabetes (especially if you smoke), trauma (like falls or whiplash), sports injuries (like boxing, football or baseball) and car accidents.There are also many medications available that could help with chronic or recurrent symptoms.

If you're having persistent swelling of the fingers, they may also be due to tissue damage, such as swelling around nerve endings, which occur after several years of repetitive stress. These muscles become less elastic, so the pressure on them increases, making them more likely to swell. Tissue damage also occurs through friction between collagen fibers in skin cells, which leads to scarring and eventually scar formation.

It should also be noted that the majority of patients who experience pain in the middle finger have some form of arthritis, but not everyone does. Most people who do have arthritis in their middle finger tend to never develop it.

Many people say they have had more energy and feel less tired than before they started treatment, but remember that this drug is very effective only for short periods of time (about 2 weeks). So don't expect a miraculous cure just like most doctors say! Ask your doctor about other options.

Q: Do you need to take your medicines every day?\nA: Yes, this is important for your health. It helps prevent your body from fighting off disease faster and prevents side effects. Ask your doctor about possible alternatives if you think you may need them. There are many different ways to use MS medications. Some may be used every single day, others maybe once or twice a week, and some may be taken only when certain conditions occur. These choices depend on what your particular condition is. Also, take into account the amount of time your doctor prescribes you each dose. You may find that a longer period of abstinence is required to work properly. For example, one person's problem might require a shorter remission period than another person's. It's up to your doctor to decide which option works best for you. If you're not sure, talk to your doctor.

Q: What happens if I miss doses? A: The way your medication works depends upon when it was first prescribed to you and what type of disease you have. However, if your dose hasn't been changed for several days while you continue using your MS medication, consult your doctor. He/she may ask for an explanation, so make sure you tell him/her your plan of action if the missed dose occurs. Always follow the directions on your prescription label for proper dosing.

Q: How do I get a refill? Answer: Consult your doctor right away if you have questions or problems finding a pharmacy near you. Or visit www.msdpharmacy.com.

What happens after birth?

After giving birth, you'll have some time to relax. You'll need to rest for up to 24 hours, and then your body will begin producing hormones. Your uterus is like a muscle; it helps control blood flow around your baby, which could lead to more bleeding if there's too much pressure on your baby during the birth process. During the first few days after delivery, your body will also release endorphins, an over-the-counter painkiller. These substances help make you feel better so that you can go back to work or school.

Q: What does an MRI tell me?\nIn a nutshell, the most recent MRI is always the best indication of what's going on in your brain. When you get a new MR, you'll be told which part(s) are damaged and why (by looking at them). If there are any unusual abnormalities, such as strokes or cancer, you might want to see an endocrinologist or neurologist first before deciding on surgery. You don't have to take anything off; the doctor will be able to give you a list of options.

Q: Should I keep track of my progress during treatment? \nThe latest diagnostic test can help determine whether you're progressing well enough for surgery. Just remember: no matter how much you improve, you won't have control over your health forever. It's important to make every effort to keep yourself active, but you'll never feel completely healthy. This is true even when you've made remarkable gains in terms of strength and function. At times, it may seem like you're getting better because your body seems to work more efficiently and more effectively, but this doesn't mean your brain and nervous system is functioning better than usual. The fact that you're getting better means that your pain levels and symptoms aren't improving (they're staying the same), so you should stay vigilant about monitoring your condition. In some cases, the treatment itself may make things worse instead of better. Also, as mentioned above, if you're starting to experience side effects from the medication prescribed, you might consider having someone else monitor you while you use drugs that could worsen your situation.

gpt2-large_54,"In a nutshell, MS is not just one disease or condition. It's an umbrella term for many different conditions, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and fibromyalgia.\r

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that affects the central nervous system. As we all know, inflammation causes damage to cells throughout our body in response to a variety of factors, from infections such as MRSA and H. pylori to environmental toxins and stressors, including poor nutrition, physical exercise, lack of sleep, and over-exposure to light and heat. \r

A lot of research has been done on the role of immune systems and inflammation in this disorder, but there are still some questions about how MS develops and its course.\r

If you have MS or other autoimmune diseases, your doctors may recommend treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs. This will be covered by Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance companies, health savings accounts, and other sources of coverage. You should talk to your doctor about whether these treatments would work best for your situation. If they don't, ask if you can try to find out more information online, at local medical centers, or in person. The American College of Rheumatology provides a list of available resources here.\r

What does Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis Include?\r

In addition to having several symptoms related to multiple sclerosis, people with multiple sclerosis often have additional health problems that affect their quality of life. To help you figure out what type of treatment might work best for you, we've put together an overview of the various types of MS and other complications associated with them, along with the symptoms most common among patients with MS.\r

Types of MS Symptoms\r

Some of the following symptoms are part of the classic MS picture: headaches, fatigue, joint pain, stiffness, loss of balance, numbness and tingling, changes in vision, and trouble walking or feeling tired. Other symptoms may also occur. Some of these symptoms may appear only occasionally; others may develop rapidly and result in permanent disability.\r

Common symptoms related to MS include headache, neck and back pain, muscle aches, dizziness, nausea, depression, weakness, weight gain, depression, sensitivity to light, blurred vision, hearing problems, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty speaking. Sometimes milder symptoms will subside after a few months, while more severe symptoms may persist for years.

gpt2-large_52,"There is no single answer to this question. Each of us has a unique set of symptoms that we suffer from when confronted with life's challenges. Some of these disorders can be managed by lifestyle changes, while others require medication and/or therapy. Mental illness often comes in pairs—one momentary episode may interfere with our daily activities and leave us feeling sad and out-of-place, and the next day it all goes away. The causes of mental illnesses can include physical conditions such as diabetes, depression, anxiety, and eating disorders; psychological factors like relationship difficulties, parental struggles, and childhood trauma; social circumstances (such as being raised by a family member who suffered from mental illness); and environmental factors (such as isolation or poor communication skills).\r


Many people find themselves experiencing multiple mental health issues at once, so they're better served if they seek help for each one. However, there are some things you can do before getting involved in treatment, including talking to your doctor about any other potential problems in your life and asking questions about why you have them. If you suspect you or someone else is suffering from an emotional disorder, such as low self-esteem, anger management, or self-harm, please contact: National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) or Beyond Blue Crisis Line (1-866-488-7386).

Example 2: The patient is at risk for developing alcohol abuse. His friends tell him that if he does not drink alcohol he will lose his job. It would seem reasonable to think he should go through a substance-abuse program before being allowed into this relationship again. This would also prevent the patient from having a relapse of alcoholism if he did go back to drinking again. However, despite all of these suggestions, the patient still struggles to cope and feels hopeless about his situation.

gpt2-large_57,"There are four stages of MS (in order):

1. Primary disease—primary motor symptoms such as weakness, muscle pain or stiffness, and/or difficulty walking/jumping;

2. Secondary progressive forms—secondary signs that do not affect the primary disease;

3. Progressive partial paralysis—possible progression from progressive to complete paralysis;

4. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy—more severe than the primary disease

The definition of ""primary"" is actually a continuum of signs that may be present during any stage of disease. In fact, some signs like numbness or tingling in limbs may have an effect on the whole body.

There are three main ways that an immune system reacts to this type of infection:

Primary response–this occurs when the patient has antibodies against the parasite, which causes inflammation. It's the most common way to diagnose MS, but it can also appear in other autoimmune conditions. The symptoms include fever, fatigue, diarrhea, joint pains, skin rashes, headache, and more.

Secondary response–the immune system responds by producing cytokines called interleukins, which are proteins produced by cells throughout the body that help keep us healthy. They can cause high blood pressure, dizziness, and even seizures.

Progressive response–a progressive course of disease takes place because the immune system keeps growing until the tissues become so damaged they are unable to fight infection. These conditions include MS. For instance, in patients with moderate or severe chronic relapsing remitting MS, their brain becomes progressively worse over time.

MS symptoms usually come on gradually over years, and many people don't realize that there is anything wrong with them until after they've had a stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, diabetes, cancer, or another serious illness. However, if your MS doesn't respond to other treatments and you're experiencing persistent symptoms, please contact our office right away for a diagnosis and treatment plan.

gpt2-large_86,"SPS is a disease that has two main pathogenic mechanisms. One of them, the autoimmune one, affects cells throughout our body called myelin, which makes us feel as if we are being attacked by an invisible enemy. The other is a genetic disorder called primary progressive MS in which the immune system attacks the nervous system causing progressive damage to the brain and spinal cord (the'spinal cord' part of the name). Some people with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis also have optic neuritis, a condition where the damaged optic nerve causes visual impairment on one side of the face and loss of vision on the other (a side effect usually treated by using glasses or contacts) but not both sides. The two types of disease can be seen differently depending upon which type of spasticity you have. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis involves the development of lesions in specific areas of the brain and spinal cord known as neurofibrillary tangles. These lesions cause motor dysfunction and memory problems, along with weakness. They often begin at the age of 20 and continue into adulthood. Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis may involve more diffuse changes, such as atrophy of certain parts of the brain and spinal cord. It is very rare for someone who develops MS to develop the autoimmune disease MS.

Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis: What is it?\n Answer: There are no exact definitions of what constitutes a ""primary"" or ""secondary"" progressive multiple sclerosis; however, there are some broad characteristics common to both. The first characteristic is that there are at least 2 different diseases that share similarities but differ greatly from each other. In addition, they both affect the central nervous system. Another difference between these 2 disorders is that MS occurs when one half of a person's immune system is attacking another half of their immune system, while SPS is associated only with the central nervous system. Finally, it is important to note that although both conditions require treatment, most people with SPS do so successfully without drugs or surgery. For more information about how to treat your symptoms see this web site on treating progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

What Causes SPS? Answer: No one knows exactly why SPS occurs. It has been proposed that it results from an imbalance in the production of various immune factors. This balance might result from a change in hormones, perhaps due to infection, chemotherapy, or radiation treatments. A study published in the August 1999 issue of Neurology included data showing that the body produces antibodies against macrophages, which help remove debris and foreign substances from",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-0.0121951904147863,2,question,3,0.015037593984962405,429,19
gpt2-large_93,"The answer is yes, although not as strongly as some believe. For the most part, it's a myth that MS causes sleep disturbances or even a bad night's sleep. There is a difference between people who don't get enough rest and those who are chronically sleep deprived. People with MS often report having difficulty getting enough time for the ""important"" things they need to do, such as work, study or socializing—even while their bodies still function normally. They may also have trouble initiating sleep at night when they really need it; they end up falling asleep more easily than usual. For many of these folks, there isn't much that can be done about it. But for others, it may be possible to control how long they spend awake and during the day. It will probably take a combination of education, behavior modification techniques (including medication), and therapies designed specifically for this group of people to help them feel better about their condition.

How much time should you have? This question has been asked from all over the world by patients and friends of people with MS. Here are a few guidelines: It is important to establish an acceptable standard of sleep for everyone involved. Ideally, one should try to cut down on nighttime activity if possible. Even if you're not working full-time, sleep needs should include adequate sleep for your body temperature and other vital functions, plus plenty of uninterrupted sleep. However, even if you don't have any difficulties with sleep, it helps if you are able to get enough rest. If you're going to bed early because you're sick or tired, consider taking naps throughout the day and at least once before you go to bed at night. That way, if you fall asleep very quickly after waking up, you'll wake up feeling refreshed again. Of course, you shouldn't use excessive amounts of sleep! You might want to start with three hours of sleep per night, but keep adding longer and shorter increments. Don't feel guilty if you need less time each evening than you did last week, or even in the morning before you've had breakfast. In fact, you could even reduce what you eat to try to achieve this goal. Most importantly, remember that you must make sure that you've got enough quality sleep for the day.

You may be able to do this if your spouse has been living with you for a long time and is at least 50% sicker than you. This means that they would require an additional diagnosis of another form of MS, such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia, or fibroid disease. However, these conditions generally don't last longer than about six months before treatment is discontinued, making it unlikely that your siblings will ever become affected by MS. If one sibling is treated for MS and the other doesn't respond to treatment, the second could get the same type of treatment as you. However, if both siblings are sick enough to need treatment, there is no way to pass on MS from one to the other.

As long as that person lives in the United States, Medicare provides coverage to care for them. The law says that ""the surviving spouse is responsible for paying all benefits owed to the decedent, including but not limited to, medical insurance premiums."" Because this rule does not apply to spouses who die in another country, the only people who qualify for protection under this rule include the decedents' families. A person dies abroad or who doesn't live in the U.S., however, and his/her spouse isn't required to pay any costs associated with the death.

The results were interesting and informative. The fact that 90% of men get better after just two treatments was mind boggling! But it also means we can get more effective ways to treat this disease while minimizing its risks. In addition, some of the factors found to increase your chances of dying from any type of cancer are not even known yet. We are working on finding out how many new compounds might prove useful in fighting prostate cancer. It's good that researchers now understand the basic biology behind prostate cancers and can begin to develop methods for treating them. It is amazing that so many people have been diagnosed with prostate cancer but they are still alive today.

What would happen if we could learn how these diseases affect different parts of the body and how to target specific genes? How much longer would it take to cure a particular condition before the symptoms improved significantly and patients no longer required further treatment? And what would happen if we could find out where the cells that cause most of the malignancies reside and identify their function? Knowing how this works will allow us to target specific drugs and therapies at which levels can improve survival and quality of life. Perhaps someday, people who don't benefit from current treatments won't need them anymore. Perhaps someday there will be enough knowledge to create a cure for all types of cancer but until then we can use our current research tools to do something about this issue.",116,outcome prostate cancer,-9.23694896697998,101,question,3,0.40725806451612906,342,11

Affected individuals have a decreased risk of developing MS (including relapsing-remitting) when compared with the general population.

This study was limited by the small number of participants and the fact that all studies were cross sectional in nature. The results are not conclusive, as there is still a need for larger clinical trials on different populations.

Conclusion : There is no specific risk factor for MS. However, people who drink alcohol may be at an increased risk of developing MS.

Cancer

An association between alcohol consumption and breast cancer has been suggested since 1920, but until recently, it did not prove causal.

In this large prospective study, researchers found that those women who drank more than eight units per week had a 17% higher incidence rate of developing ovarian cancer compared with women who drank less than four drinks daily. However, they said that their study included only one type of cancer, ovarian cancer, and so they cannot say whether there would be any other effect from drinking. They also noted that while their findings could not rule out causation, the sample size of 3800 cases was too small to draw firm conclusions.

Further research into the relationship between alcohol consumption and breast cancer should focus on examining other types of cancers such as prostate, colorectal, stomach, liver, and lung. Also, because the data do not support causality, further epidemiological studies looking at different cancer sites with similar prevalence rates will probably be needed.

Summary : Alcohol consumption appears to increase the likelihood of breast cancer, but further studies are necessary to determine the precise mechanisms through which alcohol might affect mammary tissue. Studies looking specifically at other cancers should be undertaken to confirm or refute these results.",58,Risk to develop multiple sclerosis,-7.297784805297852,52,question,3,0.22510822510822512,289,7

Backward Headstand Stretch(s):

This is an easy and effective way to keep those hips back during the forward headstand. This stretch can be done with one arm only, so use it when working on strengthening your abs. Note: there may be some risk of injury in doing this stretch with heavy weights.


Step 1: Lay on the ground. Place your right leg over the left leg and bend your knees slightly. Step away from the wall and lift yourself slowly to the top position. Keep your chest high and your lower back tight.


Step 2: Keeping the arms straight, bend forward and extend your torso towards the ceiling. Your goal is to create a slight arch in your spine. Once you get to the desired height, pull yourself to the floor by rotating your torso 90 degrees. As you rotate, push your right foot back into your body. Use your core muscles to stabilize yourself until your upper body returns to the starting position. Make sure to rest your back against something hard (wood, table or other support).


Step 3: Slowly return to the beginning position. Be careful not to let your back bend too far past its original spot. You should feel the pressure of your shoulders come back into alignment. If they don't, then you need to find something harder to roll back onto and start again. In order to ensure proper posture for the next step, keep your face up.

gpt2-large_101,"this is because of the high levels of a chemical in your body called nitric oxide. This chemical increases cellular activity and blood flow, which stimulates your cells to secrete red blood cells into your bloodstream. These are the cells that carry oxygen throughout the body and help you to get rid of waste products and maintain a healthy circulation. The red blood cell can be very useful for the rest of your life, but when it gets too large it blocks the tubes from your lungs and heart so you cannot breathe. If you have too many of these swollen lymph nodes, they become inflamed and you will experience severe asthma attacks or chest pains. In addition, if you have too many inflamed lymph nodes then some of your red blood cells will not make enough vitamin A to be able to carry out their vital functions.

How do I reduce my risk of developing cancer? Answer: This depends on several factors, including your age, health condition (such as diabetes) and lifestyle habits. People who smoke may tend to accumulate more harmful chemicals in their bodies than people who don't smoke. Smoking is also associated with an increased risk of certain cancers such as lung, colon, breast, endometrial and other types of cancer. However, the link between smoking and cancer is less clear-cut than for most forms of cancer. As far as the risk goes, there's no evidence that regular cigarettes cause any damage whatsoever. What does seem to increase your risk of developing cancer is smoking during your teenage years. While it might appear that more young adults smoke today, research shows that this change has nothing to do with any higher rates of smoking in children. It's actually because of changes in how our brains develop, according to one theory by Dr. David Hemenway of the University of Colorado Medical School. He says that after we turn 18, our brains continue to develop until we reach the point where they're ready to receive information about things like sex, alcohol consumption or even drugs. But those early years show the signs of stress and emotional problems, and our brains begin to prepare themselves for adulthood when they begin to grow and learn to take care of themselves, as well as think rationally. Over time, we stop trying to protect ourselves by changing our behavior at this late stage, instead relying on what we know works best for us—our own brains. This makes it easier to accept new ways of thinking and feeling, thereby making it easier to live healthier lives, he adds.

gpt2-large_108,"Dogs and cats are sensitive to the effects of heat (temperature), which can cause them to experience gastrointestinal problems such as stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation or diarrhea. This sensitivity may be due to an abnormality in their hypothalamus, a portion of the brain located just below the stomach's end that contains the pituitary gland, responsible for producing hormones that control metabolic processes.

Drinking hot beverages is one way humans try to reduce heat sensitivity. Cats do not have a problem with water temperatures being too high because they prefer hot water, but dogs do have this problem. Dogs often drink more water than people because dogs enjoy drinking warm liquids (hot drinks) after a long day at work or at home. Dogs' lack of sensitivity to cold temperatures means that they do not need to use a thermostat to maintain a comfortable temperature during normal activities; however, when it gets really hot outdoors, dogs will become dehydrated and lose body fluids rapidly. They also sweat profusely (sweating excessively) during intense exercise to retain fluids; these excessive perspiration causes dogs to become overheated easily. In extreme cases, dogs can suffer serious internal bleeding, which can lead to death if not treated promptly. The most common reason dogs develop acute heat exhaustion is dehydration, but excessive sweating can contribute to excessive thirst.

Best way to avoid pain is to simply not wear these pillows! The best thing to do is to check out our list of great pillowcases, especially those that are easy to clean. We love the VF pillowcase because it's made from 100% cotton fabric. When you take it off, you'll find that there aren't many wrinkles left behind. However, we still recommend that you take care when you get home after wearing the pillowcase. It's much easier for you to roll it over than to remove all the wrinkles and creases, so don't wait until they start to come back before doing this step. Just like all of our pillows, they come unmade; however, once you've used them enough times, they will become completely machine washable. They won't smell bad at all, and you should be able to see no sign of mold or mildew. Lastly, let us know what other kinds of fabrics you prefer using in the comments section below!

What is hormonal contraception?

How does it work?

Estrogen is an active substance in your body that stimulates ovulation. It works by binding to receptors on the surface of cells and blocking their activity so they can no longer produce the hormones needed for conception. The most common type of estrogen in use today is synthetic estradiol, or EE. The pill contains the synthetic version of estrogen called ethinylestradiol, which is also known as EE2.

What are the side effects of hormonal contraception?

Most women who choose to stop taking birth control pills do not experience any serious side effects. However, there have been reports that women experienced nausea, breast tenderness, stomach ache, cramping or cramps after stopping oral contraceptives. You may still need periodic tests to check for pregnancy, but these tests may show signs of abnormal development of your uterus and fallopian tubes. When you stop using birth control pills, you will be advised to see your doctor every three months to monitor what is happening to your reproductive system.

Should I tell my employer about my decision to discontinue use of birth control pills?

Yes! Employees should understand that their employer has the right to make changes to their work schedules based on company policy. They must inform their employer of their plans at least 48 hours before those planned changes begin and if possible the day of change. Employers may consider health insurance coverage of contraceptive services and devices for their employees, if applicable.

Why didn't I mention that birth control pills contain estrogen in my job application or interview?

Before submitting your resume, please read carefully through all questions. If your answer includes any reference to birth control pills, it will probably cause concern among employers. This is true even though some companies offer financial incentives such as bonuses for female applicants. Many schools and universities require candidates to disclose information regarding contraceptive options when applying to school. In addition, many employers provide information about workplace benefits and policies regarding employee access to reproductive healthcare. Please don't forget to include any of this information in your resume.

Yes, 3%

No, 0.1%

In my opinion, the answer is ""no."" The fact that women are more likely to be diagnosed with these cancers after a breast exam and biopsy suggests that there may not be any benefit in this type of procedure. It is important to note that one study found that up to 8 in 10 patients had some degree of improvement following screening mammograms and that approximately 15% experienced at least partial improvement (Borgmann et al., 2002). However, it should be noted that the use of this test could still result in unnecessary radiation exposure. In addition, we don't know how often it's used and what types of radiation it detects (Kaminsky et al., 2004; O'Connor et al., 2003; Riggs & Breslow, 2000).

The second question has two possible answers:

Stage 1: A woman who has received a diagnosis of a BRCA mutation will have an increased risk for developing breast cancer due to mutations found on her cells during cell division. This is also known as a first-stage breast cancer. Some studies suggest that up to 33% of women who have been treated with a hormone therapy will develop breast cancer later in life (Schreiber et al., 2006). Stage 2: Women who undergo breast surgery can have a greater chance of getting a secondary diagnosis of breast cancer because their breasts are usually smaller than normal. They might experience symptoms such as pain, swelling or redness around the nipple (pouching), nipples becoming enlarged, a lump at the site of surgery and/or breast changes. These women may be able to avoid the need for breast cancer screening by avoiding surgeries. The most common type of chest surgery is hysterectomy. For those who choose to have a hysterectomy and do not want to have a repeat examination, they are more likely to get a second diagnosis of breast cancer.


Stage 4: A woman who receives a diagnosis of stage 4 triple negative breast cancer will also have an increased risk for developing cancer. She will probably experience a small increase in the percentage of women with a new diagnosis, but she would almost certainly still receive a follow-up visit from a doctor every year to monitor her progress and to check if the cancer has returned (O'Connor et al., 2003).

However, many MS sufferers also have unexplained symptoms like blurred vision or light sensitivity at night, nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, and other unexplained symptoms that can be seen in any type of disease or injury. Some women with MS also have unexplained symptoms that seem related to another condition such as fibromyalgia or depression, but doctors typically can't link them to MS. This is why it's important for women who have MS to speak with their physicians about these unexplained symptoms. You can learn more about what causes these types of symptoms by visiting www.ms-symptoms.org

What are some common reasons women with MS don't get treatment?

Many women with MS have had a poor prognosis from conventional treatments. When they did receive effective treatments, however, the results were usually short lived because they sometimes stopped taking their medications prematurely (called ""off-label""). Often, when patients stopped taking the medication, their symptoms worsened and there was no cure left. In addition, many women who don't want or need an intervention haven't been able to convince their doctor that they really need one. For example, some women with MS believe that taking certain antidepressants will make their menstrual cycles shorter and decrease their ability to conceive. Others use antihistamines, anticonvulsants, and antipsychotics (medication that treats schizophrenia). Some women simply refuse to accept treatment because they think the doctor isn't doing enough. Women with MS often feel ashamed and guilty about having MS; this creates a barrier for doctors to understand how debilitating and painful the illness truly is. It's up to the healthcare provider to help women gain trust so that they can receive the necessary care.",77,How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?,-0.9706776738166808,5,question,4,0.02066115702479339,309,16
gpt2-large_1,"Chronic disease is a set of problems that affect one or more parts of the body. These problems can include, but are not limited to, heart disease, cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, musculoskeletal conditions such as back pain and joint pains, and mental illnesses like depression and anxiety.\n

In addition to these disorders there are many other serious health problems in which people suffer. We all experience some stress during our lives. Stress causes damage within the body and throughout the nervous system. It also affects your moods, memory, and behaviour. Stress has been shown to be associated with higher rates of heart attack and certain cancers. More than 85% of patients who seek medical attention for stress-related symptoms had experienced at least 1 episode of acute illness before seeking help from their doctors. Stress also increases your risk of falling.\n

The main cause of chronic disease is lifestyle factors. Many people think they have no need to worry about it because, after all, they get enough rest and exercise. However, if you take into account the fact that most people spend an average of 7 hours per day at work, walking up to 30 minutes per day on average, and that it takes you two months to recover from an injury, then you will understand why so much effort goes into managing chronic conditions. As well as having a physical condition, the person must often deal with psychological issues too. Unfortunately many people don't realise how important stress really is to them. To quote the late Professor Sir James Dyson ""Most people live in fear of what they cannot control"". This explains why we fail to improve the quality of life for individuals living with chronic conditions.

When did our modern world begin? Where did our ancestors originate from? How was civilisation established? Where does today's world start? Is civilization inevitable? Did early humans develop technology (e.g., stone tools), or were primitive cultures already around when agriculture began? How long ago was the first human settlement discovered? Who created agriculture? What happened to agriculture once it became industrialized? Was agriculture responsible for the increase in human population? Why did agriculture spread worldwide? How did farming communities adapt to changing climatic conditions? How did culture change through time?

Another important thing to remember about the root canal is it needs to be done correctly. The first step is to remove the old bone (root canal) using either a tool like a dental drill or by scraping with a knife. The second step is to clean up the area with soap and water so there is no infection left behind. Once the root canal is closed, another process known as a post-op is needed to allow the healing tissue to move back into position. Your doctor will prescribe a special antibiotic which may help prevent bacterial infections for many years after the procedure. It should also relieve symptoms such as burning and inflammation of the affected areas. You may have some discomfort at first when you do this but most people who have had root canals say they are great after 1-2 weeks. In fact, I recently heard from a patient's mother who has had 5 root canals and all 4 were wonderful! Most people report that after one surgery they feel great and feel their gums are better than ever. They would not know about these benefits if it was not for the root canal! These benefits include improved blood circulation, smoother teeth, easier breathing, faster heartbeat, less sensitivity to cold, etc. Many other reasons why people recommend the root canal include:

There are many people who have no problem losing weight on this type of diet, but some people may need to cut back on their calories if they're already overweight or obese, as they have too much insulin resistance.

The carbohydrate in your body can be broken down into glucose – which is what you feel when you eat sugar – or it can be converted into fat. Low carbs tend to make your blood sugar drop more slowly than high carbs, so you don't notice any difference in how quickly your blood sugars go up or down. Some diabetic patients report feeling better on a low carb diet than others do; just like other types of diets.

If you're diabetic, then going a lower calorie diet will probably help you lose weight faster – you'll burn fewer calories during the day instead of having to keep eating at all times.

The reason why I love it is that there are so many options, it just takes a couple of clicks to find something you're looking for. But then again, if you want more than those, try this.


The app can be used to track your steps, sleep patterns, calories burned per day, your weight, workout history and more. It even has a calendar feature where you can see how much time you'll spend on various activities throughout the year. There are also features to help you stay motivated. For example, if you think you're going to go a long way on a treadmill before finishing the app, you can set reminders in advance that will automatically remind you when you need to take another step or jog around the block. A useful feature that I appreciate is the ability to get an estimated total distance traveled each day with your steps count. This makes it easier to keep track of time spent at the gym and not miss out on workouts because you weren't paying attention. All the information that the app collects (including steps) is stored locally and only accessible from within the app itself.


Another great feature of the app is the ability to import data from other apps. For instance, I frequently check my weight while biking. To do this, simply log into the app and enter what bike you were riding during the past 24 hours. You can select which day you logged, which type of bike you had and whether you had any hills to add to make up for the added weight.

The law provides that, if a person becomes disabled after the age of 65, they cannot be discharged from their employment until they are deemed ""fit for work."" As a result, no one should be surprised or discouraged by this fact. There is currently little research on how the disease affects careers but there may be some long-term consequences. Many people with MS go back and forth between jobs, often in high demand positions. In addition, the disease can become so severe that patients must remain hospitalized for months at a time. This means an employer might find it difficult to keep up with the demands of an employee who has been off sick for several years. Finally, even though the disease can have debilitating effects, many doctors view MS as merely a chronic illness, not a disability. Although there is much more study on this subject, the outlook for people with MS is positive. According to the National MS Society's website, ""[a]ll individuals with active MS report improved functioning,"" and their overall health is generally good.

CASE STUDY: What happens when I return from treatment?\r

Case Study: A young woman had her first major stroke at age 40. She was admitted to the hospital with a headache, numbness, tingling, and weakness. During initial evaluation, she stated that her husband worked for a large international chemical company. Her symptoms persisted into adulthood, and after leaving the hospital she returned to her family home and eventually found herself unemployed. She then sought assistance through a community program that provided services such as nursing care and occupational therapy. After five years, she began taking daily aspirin. Over time her symptoms diminished significantly and she now works full-time as a nurse. While her symptoms did not resolve, her physician believes that her strokes caused by her first stroke recurred during her second stroke. Although she continues to experience fatigue and headaches occasionally, she feels she is able to fulfill her goals and wishes to continue working.

gpt2-large_59,"A systematic review of the available evidence by four experts in this field found that while there is a very strong link between short and long term use of anticoagulants, the strongest evidence points towards no longer having an impact. The most recent review from 2002 by the UK's National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) found 'there is insufficient evidence to conclude that these drugs have a causal role' on multiple sclerosis development. However, they did note that there was considerable 'overlap among studies'. One possible explanation could be that different groups of patients with MS received different levels of anticoagulation, leading them to take different amounts at one point or another.[6]

Response: As I understand it, there are two types of data. Some research has shown an association between higher blood levels of coagulant agents and a later onset of progressive disease; others show no association. This means we can't say for sure which type of data is more reliable. There also is some doubt about the actual benefits of using anticoagulants; there seems to be an assumption that people who have been previously treated with high doses will benefit more from lower doses, even though the evidence indicates otherwise. Other researchers suggest that anticoagulation may actually cause other adverse consequences such as kidney damage, bleeding disorders, and gastrointestinal problems.

Response: There's plenty of literature to support the theory that chronic use of antiplatelet therapy worsens the risk of stroke, but I wouldn't call it 'proven' evidence yet. In 2004, some doctors tried to claim that regular daily aspirin use reduced the risks of stroke and heart attacks. It turns out that a large study published just last year didn't support the idea that frequent aspirin usage led to decreased risk of death or strokes.[7]

So far there hasn't been any hard scientific evidence to prove that taking an extra dose of anticoagulants every day harms your health. But it does seem like the possibility should be investigated further.

Response: While there isn't hard evidence that using anticoagulants prolongs life, there doesn't appear to be much harm done either way. Most studies indicate that patients taking anticoagulants are healthier than those not taking them. This suggests that some combination of anticoagulating factors may protect against the development of many common diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer.

gpt2-large_54,"Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the brain, spinal cord and nerves. It is not specific to one area of the body but can affect any part of your body. You do not have to get MS to be diagnosed with the disease. Many people who are affected by multiple sclerosis are not aware they have the disease because of its relatively mild symptoms. The symptoms may be achy or tingling or stiffness in your hands and feet or headaches. Your doctor will need to look at your medical history to figure out what other conditions you had before getting MS. She may also review your current treatment (including medications) and make some adjustments based on this information. If she finds an underlying condition, she'll tell you about these and suggest changes to your treatment plan.

What are the signs and symptoms of MS?\nAffected individuals often experience some form of muscle weakness or numbness. This may range from slight twitching (tingling) in the limbs to complete paralysis. Most common symptoms are fatigue, poor concentration, joint pain, blurred vision, muscle aches or stiffness, loss of balance, problems walking, difficulty speaking and swallowing, and difficulty thinking or sleeping. Sometimes people experience more severe symptoms like depression or hallucinations. People with MS sometimes don't realize they're having the disease until later in their lives. They may be unable to take care of themselves properly, lose jobs or become depressed. Some people develop a rash at different times during their illness. In rare cases, someone who has MS can see things clearly for only seconds before becoming disoriented. Other people notice unusual movements such as eye floaters or double vision. Signs and symptoms usually disappear once the infection clears up. When did MS start? People can suffer from MS for decades without experiencing any symptoms. However, if a person develops a few early symptoms (such as sore eyes), he's likely to get the disease later in life when he starts to exhibit symptoms. The onset date depends on many factors, including where you live, how old you were when the first symptoms began, and whether you lived near doctors who treated MS patients. There have been several theories as to why there might be an increase in MS cases over time. One theory suggests that more women than men develop MS. Another hypothesis claims that women who develop MS have fewer genes related to sexual development. Since women typically have children later than men, some research has suggested that MS increases the risk of being a mother, which might lead to an increased number of new cases.

What is holistic medicine?

Holistic Medicine is a broad umbrella term that covers many different approaches to health care. However, in order for a person to be considered holistic, they must have the following four criteria:


The person must provide an approach that addresses all four components of the 4-step process, i.e.,


1) The patient must accept responsibility for their own health and well-being. This means they must take responsibility for managing their own health. Patients who do not believe or can't manage their own health are not holistic. They may have medical conditions that prevent them from taking control over their body's natural processes (diseases such as diabetes, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], heart disease, stroke, etc.), but these people would likely be referred by a specialist rather than treated.


2) All treatments are based on scientifically proven principles. These principles must be applied without judgment, prejudice, fear, ignorance, superstition, or personal bias. Treatments should not rely solely on placebo effects. People with no knowledge of how treatments work need not participate. Instead, treatments should be based on scientific evidence supported by clinical trials. If you are unsure about whether any given treatment works, ask your doctor before trying it out.


3) A holistic practitioner will use effective methods in a way that is consistent with the principle of preventive care. As an example, when treating a patient with high blood pressure, the primary goal should be to reduce his blood pressure and monitor his cholesterol level. To ensure there are no side effects caused by this change, a careful examination of each patient's blood pressure medication and diet is done prior to starting any new prescription regimen. Additionally, the practitioner must always observe patients' reactions during physical therapy sessions (including muscle contraction). Furthermore, he or she must have access to the same medications used in controlled clinical studies.


4) Holistic practitioners adhere to a specific set of values, such as respect for life, compassion, honesty, trustworthiness, integrity, integrity, integrity, and dignity. Holistic practitioners strive to live their lives according to these values. In addition, a person must be able to recognize when someone has violated one or more of the standards listed above.

Q: borderline personality disorder symptoms \nAnswer: These symptoms often make it hard for you to feel good about yourself. It means you're feeling guilty, worthless, or miserable when compared to someone else. If you experience these thoughts and feelings more than usual, you're probably on medication. Ask your doctor if you need to try different kinds of medications, depending on what makes your condition worse. Do you get upset easily? Try therapy, since you might want help learning how to manage your anxiety. Do you avoid social situations because you think everyone will judge you? Try going out only occasionally, like once a week. This isn't always easy, so consider talking to a friend who has been there before and knows exactly where you stand with regard to intimacy. Many individuals say that having friends helps them cope better with the problems of their lives. But it's important to keep in mind that sometimes friends and family can give you really bad advice. Talk to someone you trust who understands your situation. For example, if you feel anxious around certain people or places, ask them to walk you through those areas with you first. Also, you'll probably benefit from taking part in activities with other people, even if you don't know anyone well yet. Remember that you can take whatever steps necessary to help you recover.


Common Causes of BPD Symptoms

Symptoms of borderline personality disorder vary tremendously between individuals and even within one person. Here are some common causes:

Bipolar Disorder Bipolar disorder (also called manic-depressive disorder) includes severe mood swings, rapid changes in behavior, and loss of interest in normal daily routines.

If this is the first time that you have experienced symptoms of MS (even a mild one) or were treated with medications or therapy that has not helped you, then it's important to get a second opinion.

Ask questions if:

1. The disease recurs;

2. Your symptoms return during treatment and worsen again;

3. Your symptoms do not improve when you stop taking an active medication;

4. There are no symptoms that allow for diagnosis by someone who has experience treating MS.

If you're concerned about how long it will take to recover from an active relapse in MS, talk to your health care provider about whether you could be at increased risk of developing new MS-related problems (e.g., new neurological deficits) if you continue on an inactive drug regimen until you've recovered completely.

gpt2-large_123,"Hypothyroidism is a disease of the thyroid, which produces hormones that regulate metabolism and energy production. People with severe or chronic hypothyroidism have abnormal levels of these hormones in their blood.

You may be able to get help from your doctor if you are having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep during the day, experiencing memory problems such as forgetting important tasks, feeling tired all the time, eating too much or not getting enough sleep, being irritable and moody, having headaches or dizziness, losing weight rapidly, or getting headaches when you drink alcohol. If you suffer from these symptoms, talk to your doctor about options for treatment.

If you are not sure whether you have hypothyroidism, see your doctor. If you think you might have hypothyroidism, tell your doctor right away so he or she can rule out other causes. The best way to diagnose hypothyroidism is with an ultrasound (an instrument used to look at your body), called an echocardiogram (also known as a sinus scan). This test looks at how blood vessels work inside your heart. You should ask your doctor what kind of tests will be done if you suspect you have low thyroid function.

Causes

Hypothyroidism is caused by changes in the size, shape and/or structure of your thyroid gland. A deficiency in thyroid hormone may cause your thyroid tissue to become abnormally thin or develop cancer cells. Some people don't make enough thyroid hormone; others may have excess iodine (iodine) in their bodies. These conditions are called hypothyroidism-associated diseases (HAADs). They include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, Graves' ophthalmopathy, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis associated with iodine deficiency. Another condition called Hashimoto's syndrome is also sometimes confused with hypothyroidism but is really related to poor growth in thyroids. Other conditions like hyperthyroidism, hypomagnesemia (high potassium), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), and hyperprolactinemia (too little protein in your bloodstream) can cause similar problems.

What causes hypothyroidism?

There are three main types of thyroid disorders:

If you have a severe form of MS, it is probably best to take medication to help your immune system defend against infection. This could be taken as a pill, an injectable gel or a cream. If this is not possible, consider using a nerve stimulator that works by stimulating nerves in the brain. Your doctor can tell you how much, what time and where to get this type of treatment. To avoid making any more trips to the ER, use one of these medications every day and follow it closely for at least 3 weeks after stopping the treatment.

gpt2-large_92,"1) Low carbohydrate intake (ie, high-carbohydrate diet with little or no protein). This is one reason why I recommend an elimination of the low-carbohydrate diet. Carbohydrates are necessary for energy, but they also contain a lot of sugar and many other elements that may be harmful.


2) Insulin resistance. The more insulin you have, the less fat you burn. It's not as bad as it sounds. You can tolerate large amounts of insulin without problems. If your body gets used to insulin, you don't feel tired much more than when you didn't get enough at all. The problem is when you start to increase your insulin level too much and keep it up too long; this can cause damage to your blood vessels.


3) Fatigue because your muscles become slow and weak. Muscle glycogen stores (blood glucose) hold on longer before being depleted. When your muscle glycogen levels are very low, you can only use so much energy in a day. As soon as they're full, the rest of your body starts to use them up instead. Some people even call this ""fatigue."" I call it ""dysfunctional metabolism"" because the system becomes worse each time you take a hit.


4) Lack of sleep. There are some studies showing that short bouts of sleep can help decrease your energy levels. But if you're constantly going out and working hard, you won't get enough sleep anyway. So getting more sleep will be counterproductive.


5) Inactivity. Inactivity is another symptom that happens during periods of intense work. Without stimulation, we lose our drive and creativity. But if someone keeps themselves busy, they'll eventually forget about their own job and go off to do something else. They might think, ""Hey, maybe I should just stay home from work today,"" which means they'll miss the chance to exercise, run around a bit, read a book, etc. Again, you need an active lifestyle. People who are inactive often say that the ""job"" does not pay enough, so they quit. However, if the person stays active, they might find that working overtime improves their productivity. And some people say, ""I'm not doing any better than average, so why bother?"" Since a job is a valuable asset in itself, those people probably know how to compensate for the lack of income.

This has been shown in studies where people have eaten carbohydrates up to 500 grams a day over 10 years, however it should always be measured in grams not kilojoules.

Q: My doctor told me that I need to stop smoking at least 10 years before I'll be able to get my cholesterol under control. He said that since I smoke a pack a day, I must have one cigarette every night! What do I tell him? Should I quit? Answer: Smoking cessation is actually incredibly difficult, let alone if you're overweight. If your doctor tells you they cannot make you stop smoking, just ask them why they think you have to. They may say that their patients usually don't like the idea of quitting but, because of their weight, it's too hard to even try. You should also remember that smoking cessation takes months of intensive training, so it's better to do it as soon as possible than to wait until later.

In general it's best to give yourself plenty of time. The sooner you start, the easier it will be. Also, while you may feel like you're giving up at first, I guarantee you'll find that if you continue, then eventually you'll quit completely.

Q: How much salt should I use in my diet? Answer: It depends on whether you prefer foods rich in sodium (such as red meat) or other sources of sodium, such as cheese, pasta etc… When looking at the amount of salt you consume, choose foods high in sodium to keep your blood pressure from going up too quickly.

As an example; 1-2 tbsp per meal or snack (depending on how salty your food is) is good enough for most people. However, if you're trying to lose weight, then you should aim for 3 to 5 tsp daily. A teaspoon contains around 5 mg of sodium. So if you'd like to lose weight you should look for high quality meats and vegetables, low amounts of processed fats, nuts",22,my risk for developing type 2 diabetes,-10.319406509399414,207,question,4,0.828,433,8

It's been known for years that there are many different types of MS and that these ""symptoms"" can be a result of many different things going on at once - the muscle fibers in your hand or arm don't just get stiff, they get worse over time.

Answer: The best way to tell if you have multiple sclerosis (MS) is by looking for stiffness in your hands and arms. This condition can affect your hand, arm, leg and shoulder muscles. Often it will take longer than 2 weeks before the muscles start to feel better. You may notice how stiff your hand is after 10 days without pain or swelling. If this is happening then you probably have multiple sclerosis. To determine whether you've got MS, use the standard symptom test.


What causes Multiple Sclerosis?

Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease - meaning it's caused by a virus (or bacteria), either naturally-occurring, like pneumonia or strep throat, or introduced through vaccines. While the exact cause isn't known, researchers think the same genetic and epigenetic factors cause each person with MS to develop the immune system disorder differently. Some people do well without any type of treatment and others need help managing their illness. There aren't too many diagnostic tests available for MS, however there are some important ones we can look at to help us make sure we're dealing with the real deal.

What are the signs and symptoms of multiple sclerosis?


Signs and Symptoms

Here's some of what might be involved when MS strikes.

Pain, weakness and numbness in one or both hands or feet (called ipsilateral iritis) - This usually occurs after infection, trauma or surgery.

The fingers become excessively weak and soft.

Blisters form on your skin.

Tenderness and redness appear around the mouth, nose or eyes

Swelling forms on certain areas of the body such as ankles, knees, hips and thighs.

Aching in your lower back, groin and shoulders.

When to see a doctor about MS

You should consult your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following conditions:

Abdominal pain (abdominitis)

gpt2-large_57,"the main immune response to a specific antigen. It is not as simple as that, but it works like this: the cells in your body have some sort of mechanism for recognizing and attacking the invading bacteria or virus and destroying them. The way the immune system reacts will be determined by how well or poorly you are able to recognize and destroy invaders. In fact, there is no single stage of MS. There is also a spectrum of symptoms and severity within different stages, so if someone has all three stages then they may still get treatment with any given drug.

Q: How does my brain affect me? Answer: A person can be affected differently by their environment, but I think most people would agree on one thing – their brains matter just about as much as our hearts, lungs, kidneys, etc. (Yes, I know I am repeating myself, but I'm trying). That being said, we don't necessarily need to worry about how our bodies feel because of this, nor do we need to worry about what goes on inside our heads. When a person's head is healthy, then everything stays healthy. This includes their brain, heart, intestines, blood, skin, muscles, nerves, heart valves, skin lesions, blood vessels, internal organs and more… Your brain is really important because it controls so many functions which include thinking, learning, emotions and even sleep. You might recall that before I wrote this blog post, I had always wondered why my parents were so concerned with having children. They told me when I was very young they didn't want another child. Then I learned their reason was ""it would cause problems."" Now, after reading your answers to this question, I believe they probably felt I should grow up too fast. I guess this is a reasonable concern, though many mothers and fathers say ""if you had only had kids you wouldn't ever have been born."" So I suppose it depends what kind of person you are. If you're like most people, you love and nurture your babies, but you have never actually seen a baby, then maybe that isn't such a great idea. However, if you've lived through a couple of births, then you likely have seen infants at least once in your life, and you will see them again sooner or later.

There are two plausible explanations:1) The lack of oxygen or other nutrients that would allow brain cells to produce new neurons during sleep.2) Losses in nerve connections due to age-related damage to the brain. These losses can happen when the brain ages rapidly (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), but also more slowly, such as with Parkinson's disease. Both these types of memory loss may be associated with REM sleep, but we don't know yet whether they have a stronger effect on REM sleep than on nonREM sleep.

A study published in Neurology in 1998 looked at the effects of different sleep stages on Alzheimer's risk. It found that REM sleep was associated with lower Alzheimer's risk.3 In another article in Sleep Medicine Reviews, Coyle et al. showed that the risk of dementia increases with increasing REM sleep length.4 However, this research did not examine if REM sleep could explain why there was no significant relationship between multiple sclerosis and either sleeping problems or forgetting in older people. We think that REM sleep plays an important role in regulating circadian rhythms and maintaining homeostatic rhythms.

Another way of understanding what causes multiple sclerosis is through the process of neurogenesis. A person starts his/her own neural stem cell division after birth and continues this for many years until death. This allows young adult brains to become specialized neuronal structures while those aged 40 and over continue their development as immature synaptic connections. When I am writing my book, I will use this analogy as well as other sources. If I were to ask you which type of child you wanted to spend your life with, it would probably involve having a few children before you die because each has its unique needs and characteristics. On the other hand, since there isn't anything special about me, I might want to keep myself busy learning something new, just like one of your kids might do. After all, our lives are filled with opportunities to learn more about ourselves and others so it makes sense that learning would be an excellent thing to develop skills for. Many experts believe that learning stimulates growth and thus helps us mature mentally and physically as we grow older. In addition to stimulating growth and memory formation, learning provides us with positive reinforcement and motivation to work toward goals.5 So, if I knew that by doing my best work every day, my children would be better off than I am, then I would continue doing everything right until they turn 18.

If you're thinking about getting the Covid vaccine, talk to your doctor first.


How much do these vaccines cost?

Covid Vaccine Prices are based on a dose of one of two vials (2 doses) of vaccine. For example, if you get three doses in total from the CDC vaccine program, the cheapest dose would be $7; the most expensive would be $25. The best value vaccine will be available at the lowest price. The prices shown here are per-dose amounts only, not per vaccine. You must check your local healthcare provider before receiving any vaccines due to the potential risk of contracting diseases with unknown viruses.

There are different types of vaccines available by the CDC: DTaP, DT, Hepatitis A, Hib, Meningococcal (MenB), Polio, Rotavirus, Sulfadoxine and Tetanus/Diphtheria/Tetanus.

When you go to the doctor for a flu shot, there may be a slight difference between what the doctor prescribes and the actual cost.


What else should I know about vaccines?

Vaccines are used to prevent disease, but they cannot cure it. They work by blocking a person's ability to make antibodies against specific pathogens. In many cases, you'll need to receive several vaccinations to fully protect yourself from certain illnesses. Some common ones include measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and chicken pox.

But you can be in a family that is being affected by it through transmission from one parent to the next (or even more) and it's not going to cause any of those symptoms. The only thing it would do in this case is to make the other person sicker and more susceptible to some neurological problems, but it wouldn't actually result in MS. This question was asked on the ""Ask Dr. Piltz"" forum where Dr. Piltz answers questions about MS at his website http://drpiltz.com/

Q: How does having twins affect your treatment for MS? A: Twins are very rare, so it's hard to tell how much you're going to get out of them and what they'll do if you don't have them! To answer this question, look up your symptoms when you are younger, but also before you were born. Then ask yourself these questions: What do my family history and environment say about me? Would my mom have had twins?"" Do the other children in my immediate family have MS?"" If yes, then your chances of getting MS are pretty good. Most people with MS will develop some form of autoimmune disease, so the odds of developing MS is extremely high if you happen to have two sisters with MS.


If no, or you've been told that you're genetically predisposed towards MS, then your chances of getting MS are not great. And remember that when you're older, you could have siblings who have different immune systems than yours. As time goes on, it becomes harder to predict which sibling will develop MS. So if one sister develops MS, another might not. Your best bet is to start out with someone who has had their first symptoms in infancy and work toward that individual. You may find that there is some overlap between your genetic predisposition to MS and the symptoms of MS that you're experiencing today, so your chance of finding relief is increased if you take care of yourself well into adulthood.

How many times should a child of a twin go through chemotherapy each year? Answer: There is no set number of chemotherapy cycles that you need to complete.

Example: In 1999, Dr. Charles R. Taylor had an unusual case with a 30 year old man who was found with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and a total tumor count of 928mm3. There were also no signs of tumors on examination or mammography. He underwent radical mastectomy. A CT scan showed only mild nodules at the base of his right testis and very few cysts in the seminiferous tubules. The next day, he was admitted for prostate cancer treatment.


After 6 months of follow-up, he went back into surgery after being given chemotherapy as part of his initial treatment plan. After another 7 months, he came out of surgery unscathed but there was mild residual damage to the bladder. He returned to surgery 2 weeks later and went through 8 additional rounds of radiation therapy. At the same time he had been told that his cancer would have progressed to stage IV or 5 and died without having received any treatments. As the cancer continued to grow, he was offered surgery to remove all of the cysts in his urethra. It took him 4 hours to get up there and about 20 minutes to go through each one, so it was not painful at all to go through them all. His doctors said that most of these cysts were located between his scrotum and penis. They thought they might take 10 years for him to have full coverage of them, which was probably too optimistic.

Another case had a 45 year old man with BPH from a previous operation who was told that his cancer had already spread to his liver and colon, making removal of those organs unnecessary. He was referred to Dr. Robert D. Kroll who diagnosed the cancer and recommended surgery. A week before the surgery, Dr. Kroll received reports that Dr. Taylor's patient had not responded well to chemotherapy and that the surgeon might need some extra time to make sure he was healthy before doing anything else with him. So, Dr. Kroll decided to delay surgery until his patients' prognosis improved significantly and he felt confident enough to proceed with it.

Q: Is it true that red meat can increase the risk for cardiovascular disease? Answer: It's not necessarily a bad thing that you're getting some extra vitamins from your diet. But it doesn't seem like much of an issue when you consider all the other foods that contain these nutrients. Some studies suggest that a higher intake of saturated fat may actually decrease the number of LDL cholesterol particles. Also, several studies have suggested that people who consume more processed meats tend to have lower levels of HDL cholesterol, which is associated with reduced coronary heart disease risk. So, if you're concerned about your heart health, make sure you're getting enough fiber and protein-rich foods as well. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16144422#page-2

Q: Are there any risks associated with red meat consumption? A study found that high intakes of red meat were linked to increased mortality in men. The researchers said they did not know whether the link was caused by red meat itself or how many calories are in the food. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2917757/?tool=pubmed&list_uids=24954727&anatom=12453499&partnerID=8Y0P9ZK8W6EKG5B4KLX0E7JL7D1V2A1R3F2

Q: Do people who eat lots of red meat live longer than those who don't? One hypothesis about why red meat might increase mortality is because high levels of homocysteine—a chemical that disrupts cellular function—are found in large amounts in red meat products. This hypothesis is supported by recent research showing that individuals consuming the most red meat tend to be older than those who consume less red meat. http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2864320

gpt2-large_113,"It may be helpful to think of ""the"" airway as a single line. This is important because if you have multiple lines, they can interfere with each other in different ways. For example, some people's noses (which are connected by the nasopharynx) will feel warmer and more comfortable when they breathe on an open area than when they breath inside. A similar phenomenon occurs when we exhale through our mouths, which causes us to feel cooler and calmer than when we do so inside. Therefore, we should focus on how much warmth or coolness is felt by each part of our body. If we experience a feeling that feels like coldness but isn't actually cold because it's coming from one place and not another, then that means our nasal passages aren't completely blocked. In other words, your nose is functioning better than you thought it would.

Question: How often am I supposed to use my nose? Answer: When breathing deeply and deeply enough. The number depends on what kind of situation you're having. Breathe deeply for ten minutes at night if you want to get rid of those pesky bed bugs; breathe deeply and deeply during the day if you don't mind waking up to find them all over the floor!

There are many different kinds of neck stretching exercises on the internet, but if you can't afford or want a real one then try these ones. They should be very easy for any beginner! This will give you a feeling of balance in all parts of the body: back, head, arms, legs etc. It's also good as an after-workout warm up.

2.) Back, Shoulder and Head Stretch\nYou may have noticed it is not always recommended to do this exercise while lying down or with arm stretched out above head (like we did when doing the neck stretch). While lying down there is no problem because it doesn't really affect your spine – even though you would prefer that it does. However you don't want to do this exercise while trying to push off from the floor or from sitting on your feet either. If this is your case then use the following alternative: Lie on your back with both hands flat on the floor. Keep your chin resting in between your hand and the floor. Put your fingers under your armpits and pull them upwards until they touch your belly button. This will help to stretch your neck muscles. If you have trouble getting your arms up high enough then place them underneath your torso and hold them just below your midpoint of chest. You might notice that some of my friends say that it feels more comfortable with their back side facing forwards than the other way around. That's what I was talking about earlier. Now put your palms together and rotate them towards your ear so that your index finger touches your hairline. Now slowly lean forward and twist your head to one side. At first you may think you're going crazy but as long as you continue doing it over time you'll feel less tense at the end of each set. The key here is not to let your arms fall behind you during the twists, but simply stay relaxed and let your jaw drop a bit while rotating to one side.

3.) Neck Flexor Stretch\nThis is another exercise which helps to strengthen the neck. Start by laying face down on your back with your head close to the wall. Place a pillow beneath your nose, spread your fingers wide and grab the edge of it with your right hand. Pull yourself up into a straight line with your left hand and then slowly lower yourself back down. It may take a few tries before you get used to it.

This page will answer some common questions about psychotherapy, including its place in psychology and its role in clinical practice.

What is psychotherapy?

When we say ""psychotherapy"", it doesn't mean that you get into a session, go through a list of questions and then put them away until you're done. Psychotherapy is more like watching movies or listening to music while talking with someone. You don't actually have to sit down and listen to the words being spoken (or even move your head). Rather, when you speak the answers are given to you so you can ask specific questions (called questions) to get an understanding of what happened, whether it was traumatic, beneficial or harmful. So just like reading a book or listening to a piece of music, if you want help you should listen and understand rather than simply watch the movie and then try to figure out how things work out. In fact, most of us spend a lot of time trying to figure out our feelings by asking questions!

So why do people need this kind of therapy? What sort of changes might be caused by treatment? Why does this type of treatment make a difference? Here are some of the reasons:

To learn better ways to manage depression.

In order to reduce the risk of suicide.

To help someone else find relief from pain or stress.

If you've ever heard of some form of psychotherapy, then this page may seem familiar.

What is psychological testing?

Most psychologists now use psychological tests called diagnostic interview tools to gather information to identify patients who may benefit from treatment. These instruments are often used to test whether a patient's symptoms and thoughts match those shown in a questionnaire or whether they contain warning signs of potential problems such as suicidal ideation or behavior. The tool also assesses sensitivity to medication, how well a patient responds to therapy, and what types of treatments are helpful for each person. For example, a therapist could suggest that a person take anti-depressants first to rule out other possible causes of his/her symptoms before deciding which ones to continue to receive. Or perhaps a client would prefer to see a psychologist instead of taking antidepressant medications right now. To read more, please see these articles.

gpt2-large_108,"This is not a simple question. The symptoms of hypertriglyceridemia are often confused with those of diabetes, and it is important to understand the differences between these conditions in order to distinguish which one you need.

Hypertriglyceridemia is a condition caused by an increase in triglycerides in your blood or liver. It usually occurs due to prolonged low carbohydrate intake from diet alone (i.e., ""fat intolerance""). If you consume sufficient amounts of carbohydrates such as starchy vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, etc., without excessive amount of fat, then this form of Hypertriglyceridemia will be temporary because the normal metabolism will kick into gear when dietary fats begin to decrease. However, if you continue to eat too much of a particular type of food that contains high levels of saturated fat, for example, butter and margarine, then the elevated levels of triglyceride in your bloodstream will persist long after you cease consuming the foods with higher saturated fat content. This means that the body cannot absorb all of the fat contained within the fats found in the fats, and instead will make use of the excess fatty acids by converting them to glucose via the process known as glycolysis. Glycolysis requires a large amount of energy, so even though you may have eaten enough carbohydrates to help you maintain a healthy weight, you still have been eating more than the necessary calories per day. To achieve optimal levels of metabolism, you must get rid of the extra fat on top of what already exists within your bloodstream. Therefore, although you might be able to stop using this excess fat for energy, the body will continue to metabolize the excess glucose in your bloodstream, creating more insulin resistance and raising the risk of future health problems like diabetes. In addition, since the body's ability to convert triglycerides into glucose is impaired, if you do not manage this metabolic issue promptly, you may experience a variety of complications including abdominal obesity, gallstones, heart disease, and cancer. If you have hypertriglyceridemia, check out our guide to understanding Hypertriglyceridemia here.

gpt2-large_45,"Yes, you can cure it.

1) Diabetes is a disease of the pancreas. This means that your cells have no control over their own production and secretion. Your blood sugar levels are often determined by factors other than what happens in your brain (your blood sugar level). The body regulates the amount of glucose in its bloodstream to prevent an overload on your liver's storage system. When your blood sugar goes too high, your liver turns off the hormone insulin, which prevents excessive thirst and weight gain. Unfortunately, this action causes your fat cells to produce more energy as compared to normal cells. As a result, you become hungry and want more food (metabolic syndrome), causing further damage to your organs and tissues. Also, since you're not getting enough nutrients from your diet, you'll need additional help from drugs called hormones or supplements (glycogen-depleting diuretics) to maintain good health.


2) A person with type 2 diabetes has a number of risk factors for heart attacks and strokes. These include having a family history of cardiovascular diseases, age older than 40 years, smoking or alcohol abuse, high cholesterol, being overweight, family history of cancer or heart disease, and obesity. Other risk factors for heart attack include hypertension, high triglyceride levels, and low HDL (""good"" cholesterol). These conditions increase your chance of developing a heart attack even if your initial diagnosis was correct. For example, if you had high triglycerides before, they will probably raise again after treatment, possibly leading to a heart attack. If you smoke and/or drink heavily, then your odds of developing a heart attack are increased. People with these lifestyle habits also tend to develop diabetes later in life.


3) Diabetics who eat a lot of refined carbohydrates are at an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. High glycemic index foods are generally loaded with extra sugars and calories. They may cause people to overeat, resulting in weight gain and metabolic problems. Additionally, many refined carbs contain large amounts of fiber, which slows down digestion and helps lower blood sugar levels. On top of all those things, eating refined carbohydrates may lead to inflammation in the body (a condition known as ""type 1 diabetes"").


4) Diabetics who aren't obese do better when they restrict carbohydrates and stay away from highly processed foods like white bread, white rice, and potatoes.

One thing is that you may feel it when you're sleeping or waking up - this could be from blood vessels in your brain that are getting clogged with fluid or from an infection. If all else fails, then try to relieve some pressure by lying flat on your back so you don't get as much pressure in there too. Also try to relax and slow down the breathing. Most people find this helps a lot.

If you can only use one pillow for comfort, here's what you should do:


I would recommend this pillow case as it has good padding for the bottom (this does not mean it will be comfortable). The main drawback I've found is that the foam cushioning seems to absorb more water than other similar products such as this. This isn't a big deal because you probably won't need that much but if you like to get wet, I think you'll enjoy using it.

Pros: It doesn't smell like anything, especially if you sleep outside. I've never had issues with my pillows smelling like nothing at all although I'd love to come across something. They're waterproof and have no odor at all - it's not exactly luxurious but I usually wash them in warm running water after each use. They also dry quickly so you can put them away easily without having to worry about getting stains from sweaty skin. They don't move around a lot while being worn. This means you shouldn't have any problems finding a good spot for them under your mattress. It also makes for excellent travel pillow for long trips where you want to keep one side folded over while your suitcase lies flat against the wall to avoid any bumps or crevices. And for those who don't care much for travel pillows they really aren't a bother.


Cons: Again, this is a cons list since I haven't actually used these but it seems that most people are complaining about the same thing; the fact that they have to pull out their batteries to charge them every night. That being said they are rechargeable with two AA batteries or three AAA batteries. As far as I know there is no way to charge them fast enough to last a whole week but if you're going to be traveling then it is worth trying.

Symptoms of COPD

COPD is a chronic disease that affects the lungs and respiratory system. The main cause of COPD is smoking. Smoking increases your risk for many kinds of lung diseases. These include coughs, colds, pneumonia, bronchitis, emphysema, allergies (allergies), and tuberculosis (TB).

Many people who smoke may not have any symptoms at all. Others may feel sick almost every day but only notice when they get out of bed or when they take their daily medication. In most cases, these symptoms are due to a combination of things, including smoking and other factors such as stress, poor diet, and lack of exercise.

The main signs of COPD can be hard to spot in someone who smokes. Some common signs include:

Difficulty breathing

Mild coughing

Chest tightness

Shortness of breath

Runny nose

Swelling in the airways

Pale skin, dry mouth, and eyes

Some people with COPD will also experience certain types of symptoms related to their underlying health issues. Examples include:

Heart attacks, strokes, or heart failure

A lung infection

High blood pressure or high cholesterol

Gallbladder problems

Kidney problems

Other conditions that contribute to COPD include:

Smoking-related cancers like lung cancer

Certain types of diabetes, which often go undiagnosed or untreated

Diabetes mellitus

Obesity

Stroke

In addition to making you ill, tobacco use causes damage to your body's lining cells (necrosis) and can make your organs less able to repair itself after trauma.

Another major complication of COPD is that it can lead to pulmonary edema, or swelling around your lungs, which can cause serious medical complications if left untreated. A condition called ""atrial fibrillation"" can occur if these pulmonary edema-related problems aren't treated properly.

What Can I Do?

What is it?

The term ""ehlers-danlos syndrome"" refers to a group of medical conditions involving the body's response to allergens in food and other products that are produced by certain animals (such as cows). It can cause many different problems, including nausea, severe stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, muscle aches and weakness, depression and memory loss.

Symptoms can vary considerably between individuals, but they usually begin with mild symptoms such as back and neck pain, nausea and vomiting. A small percentage may experience severe abdominal discomfort, vomiting, dizziness, blurred vision and sometimes fainting. Most people get better within six hours or so. Occasionally people require hospitalization for dehydration, shock and organ damage, and even deaths have been reported from these rare cases. The exact causes remain unknown and researchers continue to search for them.

Is there any treatment?

Treatment depends on the type and severity of the disorder and how quickly it is diagnosed. Some medications may help ease some of the symptoms but generally only when taken before bedtime; others may not be effective because of side effects. In addition, the medication used should be the lowest dose available, since higher doses could lead to serious complications.

For those who don't know, MS has been labeled as relapsing-remitting (RR) disease, when a patient has been active in MS for at least 10 years and continues to have symptoms even though their body can no longer produce any new white blood cells or other immune system components. Although there are several possible reasons why someone with RR may be experiencing an episode of MS, the answer is not always clear. People with RR may experience a few different things that might lead them to believe they have MS: They could think they have MS because of the flu or cold.

They could have had a brain tumor or stroke and then feel tired all day long.

They might have had treatment for another medical condition and have gotten better, but the next morning there was a sudden increase in pain or fever. The person could also have been pregnant or breast feeding and develop MS.

Someone with MS may have experienced loss of vision, especially if it was due to cataracts. Another reason people may think they have MS is because they've been taking some sort of drug (such as steroids), which makes the body produce more white blood cell production. In fact, the FDA recommends using drugs to treat MS, such as prednisone, or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen. These medications work well for a short time (several weeks). However, these medication treatments may cause more permanent damage to your heart than the natural course of MS. So, if you have MS, you need to understand how to avoid getting sick again before you become ill again. A good place to start looking is to learn about the signs of MS so that you can make the right decisions to take care of yourself.

When should I see my doctor? When should I see a physician?

There are many factors that go into determining when you should see a physician, including age, health status, allergies, and disability status. You should discuss this information with your family members or friends, especially since you will likely need to explain why you feel so poorly. Your primary care physician (PCP) will tell you what questions to ask, what tests to order, and what types of medicines are best for you.

Stage 4 Triple Negative Breast Cancer Treatment - Key Facts

The Stage 4 Triple Negative Breast Cancer Treatment is the most advanced form of radiation therapy for Stage 3 or IV breast cancer that has not responded to conventional chemotherapy or surgery. In this type of treatment, the patient's body is irradiated with X-rays at high energy levels in order to destroy the tumor cells, thus eliminating the risk of relapse after traditional therapies such as surgery. While this may seem similar to standard oncology treatments, there are significant differences between this kind of treatment and typical oncology treatments. The treatment focuses on destroying all cancerous cells but leaves surrounding healthy tissue untouched. Patients have no need to undergo chemotherapy or radiation again. The primary goal is to destroy these tumors completely before they can spread beyond their own organs into other parts of the body, which is why it is called ""Treatment."" As a result, the cancer is treated only once per day and does not require follow up visits or monitoring. It is also possible that the treatment will be stopped if it fails (for example if it spreads outside of the body), but that does not happen often.

How Does Stage 4 Triple Negative Breast Cancer Treat?

As mentioned earlier, the main difference between traditional oncology treatments and Stage 4 triple negative breast cancer treatment is that traditional oncologists generally provide more frequent checkups than doctors who use triple negative treatment. This allows them to get a better idea about how well the cancer is progressing and how much time is left before a new treatment might help to stop its progression. A more accurate picture of the progress is critical because if a tumor reaches stage IV, then it should be treated aggressively. If it continues to progress to stage I, it is important that it be surgically removed, ideally within days of diagnosis. However, in those cases where the disease can't be surgically removed, conventional chemo and/or surgical procedures could still prove beneficial.


What Is Double-Negative vs Single-Negative Breast Tumors?

Double-negative tumors are tumors that contain two different types of DNA, one normal and another abnormal. They are known as double positive cancers. The term single positive means an individual carries both normal and abnormal copies of the genetic material. Both types of tumor are sometimes referred to as triple positive.

gpt2-large_77,"Many people feel that they have MS symptoms, and that may be true. However, the reality is more complicated than that. There are many different reasons why some people with MS may experience a severe flare-up of their MS symptoms in their later years, such as the time period between the onset of their MS symptoms and the onset of the early signs or symptoms of MS itself (such as fatigue) or the time during which symptoms started to subside (often about two weeks after the initial symptoms). For example, this could happen because an infection caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae causes inflammation of certain parts of the brain called the cerebellum (the part of the brain responsible for controlling movements), so that the muscles stop working properly, leaving the patient unable to walk, run or perform other important activities. Other factors include changes in hormones that help regulate the functioning of nerves, including changes in blood flow that can cause swelling of the legs or feet. Another factor is a change in the way certain cells use sugar as fuel, called glucose intolerance. This affects how energy is used by the body. A third, and related reason for the worsening MS symptoms, is a disruption of the immune system. The immune system helps fight off infections but has been known to fail in cases where it attacks healthy tissue like nerve endings or the brain, causing chronic pain and disability. Symptoms may also result from problems with the hormone production that controls muscle function.

How common is Multiple Sclerosis?\nAQ: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were 1.5 million new cases of MS in 2014, making it one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases affecting Americans. In 2013, an estimated 865,000 Americans had at least one case of MS.\r

People living with heart disease and other types of blood disease are likely to feel worse about themselves, and there may be an increased tendency to engage in risky behaviour"".\r

According to Dr Coyle, the UK has lost 1 per cent of its population since 1940, and could see even greater losses if it continues to lose jobs.\r

How many calories does a ketogenic / keto diet provide?\nThe average adult burns approximately 3,000 – 4,000 calories per day on a high-carbohydrate diet or 1,600 – 2,400 calories per day with an adequate protein intake. This means that a person consuming the typical American Diet would consume approximately 900 calories from carbohydrates and 150 calories from protein. The average American needs approximately 800 calories daily from fat, which is about 30 percent of his or her daily energy requirements (1). Therefore, it may take some time before your body will burn all of this excess food you have consumed through the week. It also takes time for your body to absorb new dietary nutrients (2). If you are starting off with an empty stomach, don't worry — you should still get plenty of nutrition throughout the rest of your week. However, if you have recently eaten very large amounts of food, then it's important to find out whether eating less will affect how much you need to eat in order to maintain a normal weight.

We often hear people say they want to lose weight but still feel satisfied, or that they've lost weight without having changed anything else in their lives. While these things are true, the truth is that most individuals cannot achieve significant weight loss by restricting one type of carbohydrate over another; rather, they must make changes within their lifestyle. For example, for a person who wants to improve their sleep patterns, they might cut back on caffeine and soda, or reduce meat and milk consumption.

Question: Does exercise make you feel better? Answer: Yes. Exercise releases endorphins which helps with anxiety and depression, but does not seem to do anything else. It is believed to have been the reason why people who exercised found it easier to get off their feet after they had just walked for an hour.


Question: How can I start exercising? Answer: Start by getting out there and taking some walks every day. Just be sure you are walking at least 20 minutes a day, or going as far away from home as possible (do this by bicycle if you must). After each walk, go outside, take a deep breath, look around, talk to someone (if you want) then try again. If you still don't feel like you are doing much, stay inside for a bit, drink a few water and go back out into the sun. At first it may seem difficult to get into it, but once you do it will become second nature. Get started now!


Question: Is there any way to make exercise so easy that people can do it without even thinking about it? Answer: No. The answer lies somewhere between two extremes - one extreme is that we are born with our bodies programmed to respond to external stimuli, such as our environment, our surroundings and other living creatures; another extreme is that our body is programmed to self-regulate itself based on internal cues. For example, when we are hungry, our brain signals to our muscles to pump blood to our stomach, causing us to eat something immediately. Similarly, when our heart beats too fast or starts beating irregularly, our body signals these changes to our muscles through contractions, leading them to tense up. In short, all the important cues to exercise are stored within our genes and are passed down from generation to generation. But, in order for exercise to work, we need to know how to use them properly.",97,benefits of physical activity,-3.2576804161071777,81,question,5,0.3632286995515695,353,1

How long to rest between sets?

You may want to vary this workout depending on how sore you are after a hard session and whether you feel like resting for longer periods of time, such as during competition. Also, take note of how much you are able to bench press per set and what number of reps you managed to complete each rep.

The last thing you should be aware of is the fact that the more muscular you are (especially if you're a guy), the shorter these workouts will take to finish! If you want to improve muscle size (i.e., gain strength) you need to train heavy, often multiple times per week! You'll also notice that many of the muscles mentioned above are very versatile, meaning they can be trained both in the gym and in isolation as well. For example, the hamstrings would be great to train before squatting, or simply working your glutes on deadlifts. The most popular single-muscle movement for building mass would be the leg curl. To increase your flexibility, you could include some form of ankle mobility work, such as some calf stretch training. It's really up to you!

Remember, don't do too many repetitions per set; just try and make sure you achieve at least one set of 10 reps. Also remember that it doesn't matter if you lift 2-3 times per week, as long as you continue performing regular cardio and/or lifting weights frequently enough to keep the pump going.

gpt2-large_121,"It's more common for people with this type of pain to develop arthritis in the hands than it is on their feet.

Q: What causes that?

A: People with numb fingers have a genetic defect called NIDDM (non-specific diabetic neuropathy). Some of those affected by the disease don't know they are having it, and some of them do. That can make things worse by making the bones in your fingers soft, which increases the chance of developing osteoarthritis.

There may be other factors involved, but the most likely ones are:

Age - Older adults tend to have more of these types of joints because they often get older before they experience symptoms.

Stress - It seems like the body doesn't respond well to stress, so any sudden change in our environment might cause us to become stressed too much. This makes our bodies less able to heal and could lead to another problem later in life, or even a premature death.

Mood changes - Mood problems can affect the immune system. When we're feeling down, it leads to higher levels of inflammation, which can worsen the condition over time.

What you can do about it:

1. You can try to avoid stress if possible by getting enough rest.

2. If you find yourself experiencing pain in the middle of everyday activities, talk to your doctor about ways to prevent future joint problems.

3. If you feel yourself becoming weaker when sitting or standing, sit down at least 30 minutes every day.


If you've been diagnosed with NIDDM, there are two steps you need to take right away:

You'll probably have a physical exam conducted. These tests will check whether there are abnormalities in your blood sugar level, including low levels of insulin, and other markers of diabetes. In addition, many doctors will order an endocrinologist's test if they suspect NIDDM. This exam will look at how your hormones work inside your body to regulate your metabolism and blood pressure and will help them better understand how your health affects your risk for heart disease and certain cancers. Your doctors will also want to see your glucose tolerance test. This test is done periodically to monitor how well your body absorbs glucose from food as part of your daily diet. The test involves taking a sample of the fluid surrounding your pancreas that helps regulate your blood sugar levels. You'll also have a blood test taken.

Let's have a look at each.


The problem with the Baby

In most cases, if you can keep your baby healthy, it will go on to be one happy child. But there are some that suffer from complications like infections or ear damage. As for the mothers, there are various reasons why they might not be able to conceive naturally; these include having multiple babies (usually due to an abnormality), not being physically fit enough and other physical issues. These women usually undergo medical treatment, like regular check ups and ultrasounds. This is necessary because the presence of any abnormalities in your womb can cause problems down the road. In this case, doctors recommend you take a fertility test every few months to find out what kind of abnormalities may exist in the uterus.

Another option would be to get pregnant through artificial means. A sperm donor (or egg donor) could also help you become pregnant. They often use in vitro fertilization, which is when a woman's eggs are harvested from her own ovaries and mixed with those of another person. When this is done successfully, it results in a pregnancy in about three days, sometimes faster. Although this method is more expensive than natural conception, it does yield a lot of offspring as well as give birth to many children. So don't let it go to waste!

When it comes to the mother, different things can happen:

She may end up miscarrying

She may develop gestational diabetes

A blood clot can form around her lungs or heart, preventing oxygen flow and increasing pressure

Her baby develops problems such as breathing difficulties or seizures after birth

gpt2-large_63,"It is possible that multiple sclerosis may negatively impact your career, but you should be aware of this possibility and discuss it with a health care provider. Your medical history and symptoms may also play a role in determining the likelihood of developing MS.

There are several studies which demonstrate an association between chronic stress and a greater risk for development of multiple sclerosis, including one study in which patients were divided into groups based on their levels of psychological distress at baseline. Those who reported higher levels of stress experienced longer duration of disease progression. In another study, individuals who had more frequent physical activity during their lifetime were less likely to develop MS than those whose level of stress was low. Stressful events and social isolation can cause the immune system to overreact and produce autoimmune diseases such as MS, however. There are many factors that influence whether or not MS develops, and some have been shown to increase the risk of MS. These include genetic predisposition (for example, hereditary polymorphisms), lifestyle habits (smoking, poor nutrition, alcohol use, obesity, poor sleep quality) and environmental exposures (such as toxins from cell phones). While these factors all contribute to the overall incidence of MS, the exact contribution varies greatly by individual. For example, the following studies have found that women with a family history of MS experience an increased odds ratio of developing MS if they smoke cigarettes daily, while men without a family history of MS do not. Some other research has revealed that people with autoimmune disease (such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, Crohn's disease or type 1 diabetes) exhibit a lower risk of developing MS when exposed to certain foods, like peanuts and wheat germ. Finally, there appears to be a positive correlation between being obese and having an increased risk of MS. The American Heart Association states that it is well established that obesity increases the risk for hypertension and heart attacks. Obesity is also associated with elevated triglycerides and the incidence of diabetes mellitus. Therefore, it might be prudent to consider dieting as part of your treatment program.

When considering a diagnosis of MS, it is important to remember that most cases of the condition don't progress beyond mild disability. However, if your doctor suspects that your symptoms are due to the onset of MS, he or she will be able to provide you with specific advice about how to manage your condition.

gpt2-large_54,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the central nervous system. The symptoms of MS are similar to other forms of brain injury and includes loss of motor control, difficulty swallowing or speaking, difficulty walking, weakness in some muscles, seizures, vision problems, memory issues, and depression. There is no cure for MS but there may be ways to slow down the progression of the disease or treat its signs and symptoms. In addition, there is no definitive way to identify who will develop MS, although several factors seem to contribute to this outcome.

Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis: What does Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis Include?

Some people with MS have severe nerve damage as well as muscle weakness and trouble breathing or swallowing. Other people with MS have only mild nerve damage. Because symptoms vary from person to person, you should seek medical advice about your condition at your earliest available opportunity. However, it's important to know what type of MS you have before going to the doctor.

What Type of MS Does It Affect?

It's not entirely clear how many people experience MS, so each case must be evaluated individually. Most commonly, this form of MS occurs when the nerves surrounding nerve cells become damaged. But other types of MS can result if certain proteins accumulate in the nerve cells. These abnormal proteins cause the nerves to lose their ability to receive signals from other parts of the body. When these proteins build up, they become thick and hard and interfere with normal functions like thinking, feeling, and remembering. These ""myelin"" disorders also affect peripheral nerves that make connections between various parts of the body.

If you're diagnosed with more than one type of MS, the best treatment depends on which nerve cell has been damaged. Some people are able to get better using drugs to prevent further damage to others, while others need surgery to remove damaged nerves. Doctors usually start by looking at the history of your symptoms, including any recent infections or accidents and whether you've had neurological tests such as MRIs and CT scans. If those results suggest an underlying problem, doctors might try treatments to reduce nerve damage. For example, medications like beta-blockers help reduce the amount of white blood cells present in the brain. They increase oxygen delivery to affected areas. This reduces inflammation and helps relieve pain. If you have an autoimmune disorder, you might be treated with another medication called immunosuppressive drugs. Antibodies directed against these antibodies block the production of white blood cells that normally help fight infection and inflammation.",54,What does multiple sclerosis diagnosis include?

What Is Natural Health?

If you want to find out what natural health is, then go ahead and skip down to the next section below. It really isn't difficult. The main point is that the term ""natural"" means something different depending upon what kind of food you eat. Here is a simplified list of what it all means.

Natural Food

As you probably know, eating organic foods is the best way to get the nutrients that are essential for healthy living. Organic foods contain less pesticides and chemical fertilizers, and they generally include ingredients that were never tested on animals, such as wild-caught fish and grass-fed beef.

Therefore, some people may be classified as having ""borderline"" or ""non-borderline"". The symptoms could include obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, anxiety, self-harm, substance abuse, suicidal ideation, and other problems that affect a person's quality of life.

2) Is there any difference between Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), which has been associated with social withdrawal/irritability, and Other Psychotic Disorders (NPD)? Answer: No, BPD does not involve social withdrawal, irritability or psychosis. NPD is linked to social withdrawal and irresponsibility.

3) Do you have difficulty coping with changes in your environment? Answer: Yes. In addition to normal emotional changes in relationships, our world can change dramatically over time. It is important for patients to know how to manage stress in their lives. These skills are known as skills training.

4) How do you experience emotions? Answer: Emotions are feelings that arise from within us. They are caused by physical sensations, thoughts, memories, dreams, experiences, etc. The most important emotions are fear, anger, sadness, pain, jealousy, shame, guilt, and love. To help you feel better about yourself, it is helpful to ask questions such as: Why am I feeling this way today? What happened? Who was responsible for what happened today? Was anything wrong with me? Was there someone who did something bad today? Did someone hurt my feelings today? Did anyone say anything mean to me today? Was it just me? Have I felt so much hatred today? Has anybody said anything mean to me today? Are you angry at any particular person today? Do you think this will happen again tomorrow?

What's the deal with the low glucose levels?

Low glucose levels tend to occur during times of stress, such as when working hard for an exam, finishing up assignments, etc. This can also happen if the day is very stressful due to work, school, or other situations, especially in first year (or even later years.) Low glucose can cause headaches, dizziness, fatigue, joint pains, and muscle aches. It can affect any part of your body and make things feel worse. The best way to avoid this is to stay hydrated throughout the day and eat lots of fruits, veggies, and healthy fats.

I did some research on this so I know what hypoglycemia means. Hypoglycemia occurs when your blood sugar level falls below normal range. Your blood sugar may drop between 4-6 points lower than norm. To help prevent this from happening, follow these tips:

1. Drink plenty of water.

2. Eat a variety of foods. Some vegetables contain sugars, while others don't.

3. Keep your eating low carb (i.e., no refined grains) and keep exercising at least 2-3 hours per week.

4. Stay away from sweets, desserts, alcohol, caffeinated beverages, sugary drinks, and fast food. These all increase your blood sugar. Avoid anything sweet because they do NOT reduce your risk of hypoglycemia!",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-12.725042343139648,178,question,5,0.9035532994923858,290,0

The book is very easy to understand; it's not dense with technical jargon and difficult concepts.The main point of the book was to discuss various problems which people come up against when using MS Word (or Microsoft Excel) on their computers. For instance, there are many people who have trouble with word processing software such as Microsoft Office Writer or WordPerfect, but they find that they can't do anything with them because they don't use an editor for those programs.This is often the case because of what most people refer to as ""the old way"", where you type things into the computer, then save them as files. This method does sometimes allow some flexibility, since you can edit the text at any time after you've typed it, but this is rarely useful unless you're editing large amounts of text.If you want to be able to easily get a text file from your printer (for example), you might make one out of simple words and phrases. If you keep the filename for each line as long as it needs to be, you can create all kinds of documents on paper using just plain old letters, numbers, punctuation marks and other basic symbols.One thing I found really helpful was the section about the different types of fonts, and how they affect the way a document looks like, especially if we want to display different types of characters.In addition, the information provided in the book helped me figure out a few of my own issues with using Word and Excel. For instance, I started to think that I should switch back to using plain text formatting, but I quickly discovered that I didn't care so much about having separate pages for every single type of character, as long as I could always write something down and have it look correct.For more details about the subject matter covered in the book, visit http://www.w2i.com/products/msword

The body uses a lot of energy to maintain its internal structure, muscles and skin. The amount of energy that you use every day is different for each person. It can be as little as 5% or 100% of your daily needs. This means if you're using 10% of your daily energy then you have to do something else at least once a week. If you keep doing this repetitively it's going to eventually wear down your nervous system causing a lot of symptoms such as headaches and sleep problems. So what are you supposed to do? Well, if you find yourself avoiding activities because they don't feel good, then that's another problem. There is no cure yet but there are several things that can help (and I'll explain why below):

Q: What is the difference between MS and Lou Gehrig's Disease? A: MS is an autoimmune disease which causes inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects the nerve cells in the brain. People with MS can't control their body's inflammatory response but they do manage it. When they need to live longer than usual, they may require help from other parts of their immune system. Lou Gehrig's is another form of MS, which involves the destruction of part or all of the small blood vessels in the brain. They are called meningiomas, and in some cases, they lead to paralysis. Other conditions related to the damage to these blood vessels include glaucoma, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, spina bifida, cerebral palsy, and spondylolysis, among others. Both MS and Lou Gehrig's affect different parts of the body and have varying degrees of severity depending on how severe you're feeling.


Q: My friend was diagnosed recently with MS and her doctor says she won't ever walk again! How will my friends cope with this diagnosis? A: It's important for everyone to understand what is going through your mind before making any decisions about your health. You might want to talk to someone else first if possible. Read our article on Managing Anxiety about MS. Q: Why does my family think I'm crazy when I tell them I've been diagnosed with MS? Do I even deserve to know? A: This isn't unusual. There is no cure for MS and most patients still face significant challenges after diagnosis. Your family is entitled to hold you accountable for the information you share with them, and support you throughout the process. Ask your doctor and anyone else with whom you work to let you know what questions they would ask as you begin treatment. If they don't have answers, they should explain why to you and offer suggestions for further investigation. Also be sure to learn how to respond appropriately to questions regarding your symptoms and medical history and the treatments being offered to treat your MS.

gpt2-large_57,"There are three phases of MS.

1. a) early onset, when the disease is still in its embryonic stage; b) late onset, with progressive damage to nerve cells that may not yet be detectable by conventional imaging; c) long-term progression to full disability.

2. During early MS, there is a very rapid increase in MS severity. This leads some people to ask if their symptoms are related to a more advanced state of MS. A study published in 2014 showed that about 1% of patients who develop early onset MS have progressive MS (pMS). However, most research shows that this is an underestimate of the true number of people affected by pMS and does not represent all cases of early MS or pMS. There is also some evidence showing that the proportion of patients who progress to pMS after diagnosis of MS declines over time.

3. In contrast, the majority of patients diagnosed with long-term progressive MS do not progress to pMS. The rate at which individuals progress to pMS is known as the disability progression index (DPI), and it measures how quickly symptoms worsen over time. While many of the changes seen on MRI during early MS are due to myelin damage, the DPI has been shown to decline sharply at later stages of MS, meaning that progressive MS doesn't usually show up on MRI until much later in the disease. As for the question ""is progressive MS caused by a virus"", this would need to be further studied.

4. It appears that the risk factors for MS remain the same whether someone develops early or late onset MS. People with high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking and obesity also seem to be more likely to develop early onset MS.

5. For those whose symptoms can be managed through medication, treatment of milder forms of MS seems to reduce the incidence of relapse. It's unclear why this might occur. One hypothesis is that MS symptoms tend to improve over time because they're based on earlier damage rather than on a new disease process like relapsing. Another possibility is that there is a genetic component involved. But this remains speculative.

6. Some studies suggest that there is a relationship between inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases, but other researchers don't think this is the case. A study published in 2013 suggested that inflammatory responses might play a role in neurodegeneration. A more recent study has found no such connection.",57,multiple sclerosis stages phases,-0.0734694451093673,0,question,5,0.0,408,2

Q: Are there any other causes of MS?

A: There are no known causes of MS. You could be suffering from a rare condition or you might have had a prior history of the disease. However, we would advise against making any diagnosis based solely on the symptoms alone, so you should consider all of the above before undertaking any treatment.

Q: How long does it take for a patient with MS to get better?

A: While every case has different reasons for their improvement over time, most people report improvements within 3-6 months, however some people may require more than 6 months. Generally speaking, the longer you wait to see an MS specialist, the harder the process is. We cannot give specific details about how much longer it takes patients with MS to improve due to confidentiality issues.",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-11.174918174743652,119,question,5,0.8947368421052632,178,0
gpt2-large_93,"The relationship between sleep, memory, and MS is complex. Studies indicate that sleep disturbances are a risk factor for MS; however, there is no clear link between these disorders and the frequency of daytime sleepiness, depression, or cognitive impairment [12]. In addition, there is some evidence from animal studies demonstrating that prolonged exposure to light can induce sleep-like behavior during REM sleep [13], which may be more common in patients with MS than in healthy controls. Additionally, a number of studies have suggested that sleep-wake cycle abnormalities may play a role in the pathogenesis of MS [14,15] and that circadian disruption may contribute to progression of the disease [16].

Q: What does the use of light therapy do for me?

A: Light therapy has been widely used as an adjunct treatment for chronic pain since its introduction by Drs. Stanley Levin and Donald Kollins. A large recent meta-analysis showed that it provided significant improvements over placebo in both short-term (1–3 months) and long-term (more than 5 years) follow up of persons with moderate-to-severe pain compared with sham acupuncture alone. [17] However, there are several limitations of this study. First, there were only three trials comparing light with other therapies, which limited the power of the data. Second, light therapy was administered at bedtime only. In many cases, the amount of light delivered per session was less than what would be required to achieve similar effects on daily functioning in non-MS patients. Third, while light therapy has proven effective in reducing pain and fatigue among participants receiving conventional anti-inflammatory treatments, there is still a paucity of available research examining the efficacy of light on chronic pain. Finally, although light therapy might provide short-term improvement, it seems unlikely that such short term outcomes would translate into sustained benefits over time or even that they would last a lifetime.

Q: How safe is light therapy?

A: There are very few long-term studies evaluating the safety of light therapy. It remains unclear how much short-term benefit light therapy provides compared to conventional treatment, but the potential harms associated with light therapy have not yet been adequately addressed. For example, it is possible that, like traditional analgesics, light may increase risks for cardiovascular events or trigger new attacks of inflammation. These risks should also be considered when prescribing light therapy to individuals who could potentially experience adverse reactions.

What kind of medical problems can my spouse and children experience from multiple sclerosis? \r

Many people worry about the fact that their spouses and children will receive an autoimmune reaction after getting older. This is true, but in most cases, these reactions do not occur because the immune system is compromised by multiple sclerosis. Rather, this occurs as a result of the inflammatory response that MS causes.\r

Multiple sclerosis is characterized by the destruction of the central nervous system's ability to produce new cells; the loss of nerve function; the progressive neurological damage, called relapses; and finally, the gradual onset of clinical dementia.[1]\r

How long does it take for MS patients to get sick? What kinds of illnesses cause MS symptoms? What factors affect what type of MS patients will get the most severe forms of MS and which ones won't?[2]

MS symptoms vary widely. Some people experience only mild symptoms while others experience symptoms such as joint pain, muscle weakness, blurred vision, trouble walking, or difficulty swallowing. MS affects men and women equally, even though some studies suggest that females are more likely than males to develop MS.[3]\r

The average number of relapses that occurs per year before a person gets the full course of treatment seems to depend on many factors. However, it is believed that there are two major risk factors associated with the development of early-onset MS: age at diagnosis, and family history.[4]\r

A person who develops MS between ages 35 and 45 will probably start developing symptoms within three years of being diagnosed, although some individuals will develop MS earlier, and still remain asymptomatic until death.[5]\r

If you suspect that your child may have MS, talk with your doctor. Your physician will help determine whether they would need treatment, and if so, how much. The sooner you seek care, the better.\r

What is MS?

MS (myelin disorder) is an autoimmune condition that damages brain cells and causes progressive loss of nerve cell connections between nerves. There are two types of MS — relapsing and remitting; you must either be diagnosed as having both type of MS or if you do not have both types, your disease is classified as primary progressive MS (PPS). MS symptoms generally begin within three weeks after infection by virus, bacteria, or parasites. Most people with MS experience at least one flare of the disease every year. You should always talk with a health care provider before getting pregnant.

Misdiagnosis of MS can lead to serious consequences including disability, vision loss, difficulty walking, memory problems, and decreased ability to speak. If you suspect MS, you will probably need to see a doctor early so he or she can check for other conditions like high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes. In addition, you may want to consider getting tested for HIV. Many sexually active young adults with MS experience a rebound period following pregnancy. If you're pregnant and infected with HIV, you should get tested and treated right away!

When Is it Okay To Have Sex Again With Your Partner After Having An STD/STI?

Having sex while you've been exposed to an STD or STI can increase your chances for transmitting them. However, because there's no evidence that this increases your chance of spreading HIV, it's perfectly safe to reexamine a relationship if you were previously HIV positive.

Although it is extremely difficult to accurately estimate how likely you are to spread disease from someone who was HIV negative during their lifetime, it is much less risky to have sex with someone who used to be HIV positive. Research shows that a person who was HIV negative is 10 times more likely to catch HIV in the next 30 days than a person who was HIV positive. So even though the odds of catching HIV in the future are lower, there's still a small likelihood of becoming infected from a long time ago.

If a partner you know has recently become infected with HIV, then you don't have to worry too much about being exposed again. But if they haven't yet passed on",58,Risk to develop multiple sclerosis,-2.53985333442688,27,question,5,0.11688311688311688,428,16

gpt2-large_53,"it's a process by which people work on themselves, their relationships and problems. \nThere are several types of therapy that can be used in the treatment of depression. The most commonly-used therapy, though, has to do with self-help techniques such as exercise or mindfulness meditation. These methods can help you better understand how your mind works, so you might find them helpful in improving your mental health. They also can give you an insight into why certain things happen to you. For example, if you have trouble focusing when you're at the gym, meditating may help improve your ability to focus, especially if you think that working out causes stress. You'll probably need to try both approaches for a while before finding one that works best for you. Another type of therapist is called a cognitive behavioral therapist. A CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) therapist uses a set of questions, known as an ""examination,"" to ask people about their thoughts and feelings. This way they can figure out whether your current mood isn't just due to something else or whether your problem is actually a problem with yourself. When this method is used correctly, you'll notice that thinking will come much easier. One of the basic principles of cognitive behavior therapy is ""change through transformation."" That means that if your symptoms seem to worsen over time, then you probably don't want to blame anything outside yourself - you should instead look inside and make changes right now. Sometimes the best thing to do is to get advice from others who know how to deal with depression. In some cases, there are groups that provide support for people going through a difficult time. There are even books available that explain more about depression and its treatments. You also can contact someone you trust and talk to them about what's happening with you. Depression is very common; 1 out of 10 Americans will experience depression in his/her lifetime. But while many people see their depressive episodes as being temporary, many other doctors believe that depression lasts for life. And in fact, this is true. It's estimated that 80 percent of all U.S. adults will develop depressive symptoms during their lifetimes. Because depression can take a long time to kick in, it can also lead to serious illnesses. Unfortunately, getting help doesn't always mean that you'll go back to your old level of functioning, but it does mean that you'll learn lessons about how to cope with depression and get better.",53,what is psychotherapy?,-11.801834106445312,107,question,5,0.5944444444444444,417,7

b) Dysautonomia\nAnswer:

Dysautonomia refers to an overactive bladder causing increased thirst, frequent urination, difficulty controlling the bowels and a general feeling of discomfort. It is often the result of psychological factors such as stress, depression, anxiety or eating disorders.

c) Heart Palpitations\nAnswer:

Heart palpitations are associated with high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol levels, cardiovascular disease, heart failure and certain other diseases and conditions. They usually begin after age 30 but can appear any time during life. Your doctor will determine if these arrhythmias are due to a underlying problem. There are several types of heart palpitations which are usually referred to as ""abnormal"" or ""non-polar."" Some examples of abnormal palpitations include abnormal tachycardia (low rate of electrical activity in the heart), prolonged QRS complex (long period between periods of rapid heartbeat), cardiac conduction defects (changes in electrical impulses that occur within the heart muscle) and ventricular fibrillation. These can range from mild to severe. You might also hear different tones in your head such as ""ping,"" ""beep,"" ""pop,"" ""boom,"" ""whump,"" ""crackle,"" and so on.

The number of people who will die from this disease in the next 100 years is a matter of serious concern. Some 5 million Americans have type 1 diabetes, and it is expected that by 2025 about half of these people will need to change their diets to prevent future complications or die of cancer. The risk to children under age 6 is higher than that for adults. There are more than 20,000 new cases of type 2 diabetes each year in the United States, and some 3 million people with type 2 diabetes are expected to develop it within the next 10 years. In addition, diabetes costs $7.2 billion per year.

Dr. Mark Hyman, a professor at Indiana University School of Medicine in Bloomington, said that if only one percent of the nation's population were diagnosed with diabetes, which he estimates to be somewhere between 4.1 million and 8.3 million, then those individuals would save an estimated $300 billion over their lifetime. He estimated that the average person has five to six chances to get the condition, depending on factors such as lifestyle choices, diet, physical activity and genetics. The good news is that many people can keep the disease at bay even with the best treatment strategies. But the bad news is that there are no effective treatments available today that could prevent the disease altogether.",45,Can diabetes be cured?,-0.2718890309333801,23,question,5,0.18253968253968253,230,5

gpt2-large_112,"Symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness. It is very difficult to distinguish between natural asthma and artificial/synthetic allergies because they are so similar. For example, an allergic reaction can mimic a severe cold but could be caused by a virus or bacteria (but not necessarily the same one). Asthma is often more serious than simply having a cold.

What causes an allergic reaction?

Many factors contribute to triggering an allergic response. The most common trigger is pollen exposure, although a variety of other allergens, like dust mites, mold spores, grass pollen, or dander also cause allergic reactions. Other triggers include food or water that contains certain allergens; medicines you take; and stress. You may have other triggers as well, such as an illness that requires you to avoid some foods, medications, or activities.

How do I know if my child has asthma?

There are several ways to determine whether your child suffers from asthma. First, ask yourself whether you get any coughs, sneezes, or hives when your child's mouth is dry, and if this happens frequently. If your child does these things regularly, he or she will likely develop wheezing and runny nose (atopic dermatitis) in high school and college. Second, measure how long it takes for the airways to close after inhaling or exhaling fine particles. This can give you an idea of how much time the body has before the lungs start working properly again. Third, look at your child's breathing rate. Did your child breathe faster or slower while exercising, eating, sleeping, or watching television? Fourth, check his or her stool frequency. Has your child had frequent bouts of diarrhea during the past week? Have your child had frequent bowel movements throughout the day? Fifth, try to make sure your child doesn't have a fever. If your child gets chills and sweats, or feels unwell even though he or she is otherwise healthy, there might be something wrong with his or her immune system.",112,symptoms of asthma,-4.0493927001953125,66,question,6,0.3142857142857143,330,7

gpt2-large_83,"The symptoms are similar to those associated with other MS-related relapses. This is because the first sign of MS is usually an exacerbation of the disease, especially in young people who have been given immunosuppressive drugs for years and then experience a period of ""spontaneous remission."" When this happens, there's no obvious cause that would explain the change in symptoms. For example, the patient could be taking a combination of prescription drugs (for example, insulin) or may just be having difficulty sleeping. So what could account for this sudden increase in symptoms? If you had another autoimmune attack, like anaphylaxis, it would seem to be related to the same problem. But the other thing to consider is that the symptoms may also be caused by something else that started when your immune system attacked an old injury—a cancer, say. That might explain why symptoms were changing right before the first MRI. And if they weren't, maybe you should have seen your primary care provider after the second MRI to make sure nothing was wrong. You could look at the results in one MRI so that your team can see how your body responds to treatment and help you decide whether treatment was appropriate.

Q: How do I know which tests will work best for me?

A: We recommend getting a diagnosis from a neurologist, such as Dr. Eric Finkelstein, or another specialist in MS. He or she can evaluate your condition and recommend treatments that'll work well in your specific case. Your healthcare professional can tell you more about each test and what to expect during your evaluation. A scan isn't always necessary, though. Sometimes it won't show any changes, even without a CT scan or MRI. Some tests don't detect MS symptoms entirely; for example, you may not notice much pain while lying down on a bed. In these cases, your physician might suggest using a noninvasive technique, such as applying pressure to the skin in different places along the brain. Another option is to use a neurofeedback device to monitor certain aspects of your brain activity and try to adjust activities that aren't working well. These devices can cost thousands of dollars; we encourage you to find out more information about them online. Finally, many patients find relief through a combination of medications, diet modification, exercise, and other therapies. Our team uses these approaches together to treat their MS.

gpt2-large_118,"Treatment of stage 4 triple negative breast cancer is based on two types of drugs (TCAs and tamoxifen). TCA's are used to stop the growth of cancer cells which have metastatic potential. They have been shown to be safe in patients with advanced disease, but they may cause side effects such as headache or nausea during chemotherapy. The most common side effect associated with TCA use in women with advanced disease is gastrointestinal upset. In addition to that, a small percentage of women with advanced disease will experience problems related to pregnancy, including miscarriage. Tamoxifen blocks a protein called cyclooxygenase-2 which is involved in transforming breast cancer into other cancers. Because it inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 it prevents tumor cell migration into surrounding areas, resulting in less spread to adjacent areas. So the best option for using tamoxifen in this population is to use tamoxifen at one dose per week instead of four times per week because it helps decrease the risk of pregnancy complications. In addition, if you think that you might have advanced disease then you should talk to your physician about starting tamoxifen at three doses per day at least until the next checkup.

What symptoms do you notice after being treated for triple positive or triple negative breast cancer?

Ask a question

If you're feeling better about yourself or if you haven't experienced any unpleasant symptoms within the last few weeks, go ahead and ask a question!

How long does it take to see some results from your new treatment?

It can vary depending on how many tumors were removed and what type of treatment was used. Many people who start out with a single dose of tamoxifen see significant improvement within 6 months. For example, patients who started off with three tamoxifen treatments saw an average reduction of 13% in their average mammogram scores within six months. Patients taking five or more doses saw a 50% reduction. However, even when you're very successful in getting rid of all of the tumors you still need to monitor your progress closely. Your doctor will want to know how well you responded to each dose of tamoxifen so he or she can decide whether or not you'll continue the therapy. If you've followed a typical treatment plan like we recommend above, there won't likely be any major changes to your regular routine after surgery.

Q: If I am diagnosed with MS, should I take part in clinical trials? What are the chances that I'll pass the trial and receive funding to pursue additional research studies?

A: Trials can help us learn more about how effective treatments might be for patients with MS. They can also determine if there's an acceptable risk and benefit ratio for clinical trials. We encourage our researchers to look carefully at patient data to ensure that they've identified enough patients to give them the best chance of success. However, we cannot guarantee specific results from clinical trials when funded. To learn more about how these programs work, go to www.fda.gov/medwatch/studies.html.

Q: Do I still get the opportunity to participate in research after being diagnosed with MS?

A: Yes! For people diagnosed at age 65 years and older, the National Institutes of Health provides funding for several types of research, including MS. Learn more about the NIH.gov website.

Q: Will the research I'm involved with be paid for by Medicare or Medicaid?

A: Not necessarily. These services were created through legislation designed specifically for MS, but many state governments now offer some type of reimbursement for the costs of participating in research and doing clinical trials.

Dr. James Andrews is a New York City-based dentist who's been working with the Toothpick Project for 18 months now. In the past, he had no idea that his patients would need anything more than an appointment at the office and a dental plan to pay for it all—and even then, only if they were really serious about getting their teeth fixed. He calls the project the best thing that's ever happened to him, and he thinks it might have saved his life.

""It was such a revelation,"" Andrews says. ""I never thought I'd see this many people willing to wait around in the waiting room.""

The project started out with a simple premise: Why not get your teeth done? But instead of being just another DIY project, the campaign evolved into something much bigger. It morphed from a series of online videos on YouTube to an international movement—it went viral. Since its launch, it's helped restore nearly half a million American teeth. And since June, it's expanded nationwide.

When Dr. Andrew took his own life last year after struggling with depression and anxiety, the world was ready to offer a helping hand. But that wasn't enough for the young dentist in Kansas. He wanted more. So he came up with the Toothpick Project. His goal was to help as many Americans as possible stop losing their natural teeth. He was determined to use his work experience to inspire other dentists, too—in a way that wouldn't seem crazy or gimmicky but actually make sense.

Andrews' dream was born two years ago while attending one of his dentist's seminars. That's when he decided to take a different approach. Instead of teaching doctors how to diagnose and treat heart disease, he asked them what they did for fun. After a few minutes, he realized that nobody cared what they did with their lives anymore, so why should they care what they put into theirs? With that insight, he launched a web show called Dental Doc Stories, which features his personal stories of living by his principles.

His vision wasn't just to educate the public about the benefits of good oral hygiene; it was also intended to create a community for dentistry professionals to learn from each other, exchange ideas and find common ground.

Second, in addition to being part of our company, I am also one of its most valued employees. I am expected to maintain an exemplary professional record and report directly to management. Third, I need to keep my personal life completely private. When I start feeling depressed or anxious, I can't go into a meeting without someone asking where I am.

However, it's important to note that you should consult your doctor before initiating any form of medication therapy. For example, you shouldn't use medications to treat pain until after a patient has been diagnosed. Also, you should not assume that anything prescribed by a medical provider applies to other people. The physician who provides care for you will want to speak with you about your specific situation. If you decide to seek help from a healthcare provider, remember that the individual treating you will likely recommend different options than those recommended by your physician. Although some medications have been found to reduce or eliminate the symptom of MS in patients with mild to moderate MS, other medications may provide benefits to other patients, particularly those with active or worsening MS. 5/3/2010 Q&A: My mother died of MS.

gpt2-large_35,"Ketosis is one of the benefits of a healthy lifestyle. This means that you should be eating lots of fruits and vegetables, reducing your carb intake to around 20-25% of your daily calories from carbohydrates (excluding any sugars or refined grains) and increasing it to at least 30% of your total calorie intake in order to maintain good health. There are no clear rules about how much carbohydrate an individual can eat on a daily basis during the day but this is generally recommended by doctors who believe that too little may cause weight gain and too much can damage the heart. It's also important not to overeat at meals because this will increase blood glucose levels and make you feel hungry again later in the day which would mean you'll need to eat more food.

If you're unsure about whether you can safely follow a low carb diet then don't worry! You can still have all the same great health effects as if you were following the Mediterranean diet but without having to worry about losing weight or eating too many calories. The key is to keep your carbs under 10g per kilogram bodyweight while maintaining a balanced meal plan which includes plenty of vegetables and fruit. If you already know that you can tolerate a lower carb lifestyle then you probably shouldn't have to worry about sticking to this for long as it won't take much effort to adjust once you've reached your goal weight.

A ketogenic diet is often better suited to individuals who suffer from type 2 diabetes than others who do not. Individuals with Type 1 Diabetes (where insulin resistance occurs) must consume between 200 and 400mg/day of insulin; however, since we know that ketone bodies exist throughout our bodies, a ketogenic diet could easily lead to excess blood sugar spikes which can lead to complications such as kidney disease, blindness, liver damage etc. We recommend avoiding any form of high carbohydrate snack during the day or evening in those with a history of diabetes. In addition to preventing any complications, these foods can actually help to decrease inflammation within the body and improve overall wellness by improving mood, improving appetite control and helping regulate blood pressure.

Interviewer: What is the most important thing that you learned from this study, and what can we learn from it?


Dr. Peter Attia: This study was very interesting, because it showed that there are many different effects in different people when they choose to exercise or to lose weight. For example, we know that people who are obese are more likely to be overweight later on in life. So, if you're obese now and you decide to reduce the amount of fat you've accumulated over the years, chances are that that will help your health in the future as well. And we know, for instance, that physical activity increases HDL cholesterol levels and lowers LDL cholesterol levels, so lowering those two risk factors improves the overall cardiovascular risk profile. As well, there's evidence that moderate alcohol consumption decreases risk of coronary heart disease. So, while these studies all point towards an association between obesity and cardiovascular problems, how much impact each one has depends largely on which type of diet they follow, and at what age. A healthy adult who eats a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet can still be overweight later on if he decides to increase his calorie intake during adulthood, whereas someone with metabolic syndrome (type 2 diabetes) might gain weight earlier than someone without such conditions. It's important to emphasize that there isn't a clear ""right"" or ""wrong way"" to change diet; instead, it turns out that the optimal lifestyle may vary depending on which type of diet the person follows, which part of the body changes, and whether the goal is to burn fat or muscle. In other words, there isn't just one right way of doing things! Also, note that although BMI and BMI categories were used to classify individuals into categories, there are many ways to describe them. For example, an individual classified as underweight may actually be a bit heavier than average, based on the fact that their body mass index is lower than average.

gpt2-large_131,"To start with, you want to use a foam roller and have someone push the puck down your body. It's very important that the player knows what he wants to do before doing it.

Next, you'll need to move the puck across the ice. This is where you will try different angles on the blade of the stick and also make sure to get in good position between the circles of the boards. Don't overdo anything in this step! The goal is to be able to make a quick move without having a lot of time taken up by waiting until a pass comes in or being caught off guard. Just keep moving forward, and hopefully, the puck goes through one circle into another. Keep doing this until you can just barely see the center of the net. If that happens, take some time to adjust yourself because you are still not properly aligned at all times.

After that, it's time to work on getting in front of the goalie. First, put as much weight behind the stick as possible; this way, you won't tip the stick off balance when you move from side to side. Next, hold your stick straight out and in front of you while you practice putting pressure on your opponent's back hand. Try to maintain constant pressure throughout the entire length of the rink. As long as you stay centered and keeping solid contact, you should eventually succeed. Once you're comfortable with this part, it's time to begin working on your positioning around the blue line. You'll want to place more emphasis on making sure your stick is facing the right direction so that you don't cut off passing lanes. Once you've got these two things worked out, it's time to work on finding other areas of the ice to attack. One thing I learned during my time playing in Europe was that trying to find an area to sneak through is often counterproductive—it leads you away from your objective and gives a false sense of security.

Q: What causes hair loss? Answer: Hair follicles are dying. This means they're dying from the inside out because of an infection or other conditions. Your hair cells are being attacked by microscopic organisms called keratinocytes. These keratinocytes, known as melanocytes, produce a substance called eosinophil protein that allows hair to grow back. When you remove your hair and put it into another person's hands, there is nothing preventing them from using this new hair tissue to replace their own. So, your hair grows back! If you have no hairs left on your body (a condition called alopecia), this process may be irreversible (that is, permanent). In addition, the growth of hair does not occur evenly across your entire scalp - it can vary between different areas of the scalp. For instance, if you have very thin hair (less than 5 millimeters) at one side of your head, it will spread over much larger areas and take up even more space. And when you go bald, you will lose that hair shaft.

So how do we know whether a change in our hair color has something to do with a problem with your health? There are several factors that might contribute to a change in your skin tone. The most important factor is sun exposure. It seems obvious to us now, but when you were young you probably had intense amounts of sunlight on your face all day every day for years before you started getting sick. Sunlight penetrates deep into the skin and creates pigmentation changes throughout your body. Since your skin contains melanocytes, this pigment is produced and stored in your cells. Over time, the light intensity makes these melanocyte cells turn white while the darker ones become brown or gray. One study suggests that sun exposure increases the risk of developing blackheads and pimples on the forehead, temples and chin. Other studies suggest tanning beds are bad for your skin since they expose you to more ultraviolet light. The combination of UV radiation and tanning beds can increase the amount of vitamin D in your bloodstream and decrease your ability to make vitamin E. Vitamin E helps prevent macular degeneration. Some researchers speculate that vitamin E supplements can cause acne because they may block the absorption of vitamin A and folate from food sources like fruits, vegetables and meat. Some scientists say the increased use of sunscreen may also play a role in certain types of dark spots forming on your face and neck.

If you think you are having worsening symptoms after taking these medicines, consult your physician immediately.


Q: My MS has been going on for nearly 12 years, but the symptoms haven't gotten worse since then. Is there anything that could make my disease even worse?\nAnother symptom of MS is fatigue. You may also notice other signs of problems such as feeling restless (feeling like you want to go somewhere) and difficulty concentrating.


A: The most common cause of fatigue in MS patients is decreased muscle tone. Many people think that MS causes their muscles to atrophy because they cannot train properly, but it doesn't work this way at all. In fact, many studies have shown that many MS patients who are receiving medication for their disease actually appear to improve their performance in tasks requiring strength, speed, balance and coordination, which may result from changes in the nerve fibers themselves.


As far as the rest of the symptoms, I'm afraid we still don't know much about them. There are no objective diagnostic tests available. The best thing to do is follow your own doctor's advice, and spend time with a health professional who specializes in this area to get more information. There may be some cases where it helps to do both.


Q: Can I get multiple sclerosis without getting treatment?\nYes, you can get multiple sclerosis without being treated! There are two ways to get MS; one is through an autoimmune attack caused by a specific virus called Sjogren's Syndrome (which occurs when the body attacks itself). This condition usually happens within the first few years of life, and can be extremely painful, especially if it comes on suddenly. Although this condition affects approximately 1/3 of all children born in the U.S., there are no known vaccines or treatments for this type of MS. Another type of MS, named autoantibodies (meaning they attack the immune system), is often triggered by certain types of infections. If your immune system is underactive due to infection, you might experience pain, itching and stiffness. While other types of MS can be treated successfully, many of us find our symptoms diminish over time.

This could mean treatment changes in everything from walking to speech to eating, which would make living with MS much more comfortable for those affected.

vitamin D deficiency and MS\nAnswer: vitamin D is an essential nutrient for the body and is produced primarily by our skin cells. As with many vitamins, the amount you need will depend on your weight and activity level. In general, people who are overweight or active should aim to get sufficient amounts of this important mineral. People who are less active may have lower requirements than those who are more active. For example, individuals with normal levels of calcium in their bones should receive at least 600 international units (IU) daily; those with low calcium levels, such as those with osteopenia and osteoporosis, may require significantly higher doses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advises taking 1,000 IU daily of vitamin D for children between 6 months and 2 years of age. However, these guidelines do not apply to pregnant women or lactating mothers. Research suggests that women who take birth control pills should be cautious when they supplement with vitamin D because their bodies may produce too much. It is also best to consult with your health care provider before starting a regimen of oral vitamin D supplementation for adults.",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-10.345257759094238,74,question,6,0.3627450980392157,230,0
gpt2-large_54,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease. It affects the central nervous system and spinal cord, resulting in nerve degeneration and disability. The immune system destroys white blood cells that fight infection and inflammation. These white blood cells also destroy some of the small nerve fibers within the brain called myelin sheaths. This causes pain, weakness, loss of muscle coordination and numbness. For people who have MS, symptoms are often worse than they were before they developed the disease.\r

There are three main types of MS. First, there are primary MS and secondary MS. Primary MS, or relapsing-remitting, involves an attack on one of your nerves or more than one nerve at a time. It's characterized by progressive loss of motor function and sometimes paralysis of the arms and legs. People with this type usually have no other health problems. Second, there are fibromyalgia attacks -- attacks of pain throughout the body -- where a person might develop severe fatigue and loss of feeling around the stomach area. And finally, there is MS unilateralis, which means the disorder results from both sides of the body affected. The most common form of MS is known as relapsing-remitting MS. In this case, you start to experience new symptoms after the first attack. Relapses are more likely during early periods of MS, but you can recover and go about normal life. Most people with relapsing-remitting MS are still able to work and enjoy social activities. They may find that their physical and cognitive abilities gradually improve over the years. \r

All these forms of MS affect different parts of the body. They can be very similar, such as the first type of MS, or they can be quite different. For example, there is also a form of MS that only affects the muscles and bones of the face, neck and back. You cannot feel any movement or strength in those areas, nor can you make use of them for many hours without assistance. As a result, if you have relapsed, the effects of the relapse are often immediate rather than gradual. Symptoms may come and go quickly or last several months. Some people have long-term damage that includes loss of vision, hearing or the ability to walk normally. For others, however, symptoms appear suddenly or persist for months. Many patients with MS suffer from serious medical problems including depression, memory impairment and neurological complications. However, people with MS generally live longer than other people because of fewer complications and better treatments.\r

What causes mental health problems?

If you've had the disease of mental illness since childhood, such as bipolar disorder (manic-depressive disorder), schizophrenia, major depressive disorder (MDD) or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), then there is a greater chance of developing mental illnesses later in life. These disorders do not all occur at once. You may develop one type and another type within the same family or family group. As children grow up, however, they usually become more tolerant of being different from other people, especially when it comes to emotions. At times, this tolerance can lead to inappropriate behavior. In adults, certain types of moodiness and irritability seem to be normal or even healthy. But too much of one kind of emotion leads to mood swings and a range of behavioral issues. This is why some people seek professional psychiatric care for psychological problems.


How can I tell if my child has mental health concerns?

It can be hard to know what to look for because mental health affects everyone differently. Some parents may feel that a particular behavior or attitude is unusual or odd, but they don't know how to explain it to their child. Your baby, toddler or preschooler will need extra guidance on how to interact with other people. To avoid having this happen to them, discuss this issue with them directly. You'll also want to pay attention to things like eye contact, smiling, eye contact and physical activity; these can be indicators of emotional stability. Keep in mind that mental health may go unnoticed until adulthood. Sometimes we miss warning signals until someone else tells us to. Here are some tips:

Don't take advantage of a person's bad moods to make yourself feel better.

Avoid making smalltalk to strangers unless you're really sure you understand each other.

It also includes everything from natural products such as herbs, minerals, plant foods, and so forth to synthetic drugs that have been developed and refined to produce desired effects.\n

How can one be certain that one's body is not being used for medical purposes? \n\nThe way to know is to follow your doctor's orders. For example, if you have an infection or cancer, you should seek treatment immediately. If a practitioner prescribes a drug, then he has the authority to prescribe that medication without regard to whether there was a legitimate reason for its use in the first place. The only exception would be when the drug itself causes serious harm. This is a good rule of thumb. But if this is the case with the prescribed medicine, then the patient needs to pursue alternative treatments. \n\nIf this is not the case, then the practitioner may not perform his duties according to a proper form of ""integrative"" medicine. For example, a person who has had a heart attack at home may not get a transplant there. However, if that person went to a hospital where they did receive a transplant (for instance, a large kidney), then the individual could go back home and continue using those organs as long as he has not received any new transplants since. The same principle applies if another organ is being replaced. It is not possible to take a pill that kills you while the body still functions. Another example: Someone is having a heart attack on their own, and they find out that the doctors have tried to prevent the heart attack by administering antibiotics. When the doctor gets out of bed, he starts taking the antibiotic, but before they can finish taking it, the man passes away. Why do we call these cases of death ""natural""? Because people die naturally all over the world all the time. The only thing different about our daily lives is that we try to protect ourselves against illness and death through some kind of organized action. Allowing for exceptions, we can say that anyone can become healthy and strong simply by following proper care; however, if someone uses pharmaceuticals that will end up killing them instead of saving them, then we need to speak up loudly to stop this abuse. We must support legislation that prevents doctors from prescribing harmful prescription medications to patients.

Some people believe that some people with this condition don't actually qualify as ""borders,"" but instead, just have traits that can sometimes cause problems when their brain is not functioning properly.

gpt2-large_85,"A number of factors are known to influence relapses in MS. Among them, the underlying cause(s) and treatment regimen, as well as the individual's level of disability at time of relapse/recurrence, can all be important factors.

Relapse rates for chronic fatigue syndrome patients were reported at a rate of 25% (1). However, the incidence of relapses may also be influenced by other factors such as: the severity of the illness; whether or not it is treated with steroids; how long MS has been ongoing; and whether it has been caused or exacerbated by another medical condition. The causes of relapse for MS have yet to be clearly established, but there is evidence that certain immune-related disorders may affect relapses. For example, T-lymphocyte activation has been shown to reduce both acute and chronic relapses (2, 3). In addition, several studies suggest that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which commonly accompanies COPD patients with MS, may impair immune function (4–7). Thus, it appears that the presence of any of these conditions could exacerbate relapses.

Some of this information may lead us to conclude that some people with MS should avoid taking immunosuppressants, like corticosteroids, during periods when they are already experiencing exacerbation of their disease. Alternatively, people who do take immunosuppressant drugs should talk to their healthcare providers about whether or not they would be better off getting help for their MS.

If you've got the right treatment, it might work well for you. If not, then maybe other methods are in order.

In these cases, a second, more thorough, neurological evaluation may be necessary as the first one could have failed. You can use this same approach with any condition that needs help; it's important that you understand what kind of therapy would best suit your situation and how much time you'll need.

In answer to your question I would say that the most common cause of fatigue in MS is postural instability which has a direct impact on the lower extremity (hip and knee) muscles. This condition can lead to the symptoms you describe including pain, weakness, muscle cramping, tightness or weakness in these areas. If you have problems with postural instability there are some things you can do, such as stretching, exercises to strengthen joints and strengthening of your body's own natural movements. Other things you can try are: changing positions while lying down; walking or doing other activities that will allow you to stand up straight without losing balance; standing with arms fully extended while sitting down or leaning forward; and using push ups to increase strength.

gpt2-large_68,"The following list is a list of commonly experienced symptoms associated with MS, but there are many other possible causes for these symptoms, and not all of them will be present in every patient. Some patients may experience a combination of symptoms, or none at all. Symptoms that have been listed here include fatigue (not just feeling tired), headaches, neck stiffness, joint pain, depression, loss of appetite, and more. While it's important to recognize the importance of each symptom as an individual case, sometimes they aren't all associated with the same underlying cause, so you can learn about their potential triggers and make your own diagnosis based on your clinical findings. When looking at a patient who has specific, chronic symptoms, you should look for any evidence of MS activity in the patient or his/her family members. If MS activity is suspected, ask if this person is currently taking medications to treat the condition and whether he/she has ever had a medical examination by a doctor with a neurologist specialty. For example, some people with MS may become ""dysfunctional"" without any treatment at all due to medication side effects or changes in lifestyle. Ask to see any tests done by a neurologist who specializes in MS. In addition, check out the following article on MS from the Mayo Clinic, which details what testing might be needed to find the underlying cause of MS and determine the best course of action.

How common are MS symptoms?

Symptoms are different depending upon the severity of the disease. If you're having difficulty concentrating, thinking clearly, walking long distances, or making decisions, you may not be having trouble with physical activities or social interactions, but you are likely experiencing significant impairment in functioning.

It may help to think of the MS symptoms in terms of 3 levels of severity, ranging from mild to severe. A level 1 problem usually won't result in much impact on daily life, but it could take longer than usual to recover completely. It also depends upon how seriously or severely the symptoms affect your ability to work, study, care for yourself, or perform basic functions such as dressing yourself or bathing. You may need additional assistance with tasks that require mental alertness. Your day-to-day living should remain normal, even though you're being treated for a serious illness.

The next level of severity is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, including:

Level 1 problems usually start in the early 20s, but they typically don't occur until age 50 or older. These symptoms include memory loss, problems remembering",68,List of multiple sclerosis symptoms,-0.1010502055287361,0,question,6,0.0,428,22

Q: How long will I need? Answer: 5-7 years depending on how well you do the treatment. This is why we don't recommend MS medication for a shorter duration. Some people feel better after two or three months of treatment.

Q: I have an immunodeficiency disease and the symptoms are worsening. What should I do? Answer: You can try to get your immune system functioning more normally in order to improve their response to the drug. Also, there might be other reasons that you experience such severe symptoms. For example, your body may not like the medicine being injected into it. If you get a flare up from your medical history, please refer us for help.


You also need to keep doing regular physical exercises, including walking at least 20 minutes every day. This will strengthen your joints, muscles and bones as well as increase circulation and blood flow. Keep in mind that all these steps are recommended by Doctors who know about the condition and have treated it many times before with no problems. There is no specific information as to whether the prescribed medications may make you sick, but it's best to take them according to your doctor's recommendations.

Q: What happens when my treatment is finished? Answer: Your body starts producing antibodies against the active ingredient that was used during the treatment which is what causes your inflammation. So, whenever you start getting new symptoms, your body will reactivate its own defenses and this makes things worse. This is the reason why some patients seem to ""get off"" therapy even though they haven't fully recovered. In fact, most patients just want to go back to normal activity again while trying to recover the effects of the illness.

Q: Where should I keep my pills? Answer: The most effective way to store them is to keep them under the counter so that they don't contaminate food or drink.

gpt2-large_86,"As a result of the progressive disease, you may need to have your spleen removed.

Treatment for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis is based on the clinical characteristics and response of the patients to treatment. A single therapy can be effective in all patients, but there are some patients who respond well only to one or two therapies, thus requiring more aggressive treatments. This approach has been employed with success in cases where the primary course is unresponsive.

To date, several different types of immune-related agents have been used as immunomodulatory agents. The most widely used antineoplastic drugs are cyclophosphamide (CPA), interferon alfa (IFN) β1α/β2, and erythromycin. These drugs have shown promise in animal models of MS and in early human studies were found to improve disability and survival time when compared with standard disease management. However, many of these early reports failed to demonstrate whether CPA or IFN β1α/β2 was more effective than placebo in treating MS symptoms. In a double blind randomized trial comparing CPA and IFN β1α/β2, however, both drugs showed efficacy, although neither drug had an advantage over placebo. In a subsequent phase II study using CPA alone or combination with IFN, neither drug was superior to placebo in reducing disability and improving quality of life [28]. Similarly, a double blind controlled trial of IL-10 administration versus an active comparator revealed that in the case of patients with relapsing-remitting MS, IL-10 improved symptoms compared to placebo but not IL-12 [29]. Although IL-10 does show promise in treating MS, its effects on disease progression are unclear. There are few data available regarding the possible role of CPA, IL-10, or other non-immune-stimulating agents in the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. In a recent Cochrane review that focused exclusively on the use of immunotherapies in the treatment of relapsed or refractory MS, it was concluded that there is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to support any specific therapeutic strategy, suggesting that future research should focus on identifying novel target compounds with potential efficacy in this important indication. Additionally, there have been no major developments in the area of alternative treatments since publication of the Cochrane review in 2008.

There have been advances in our understanding of how cells behave in autoimmune diseases, which make them much easier to treat. It has become clear that various factors",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-0.0139643289148807,4,question,6,0.03007518796992481,385,5

MS does cause daytime fatigue, which can have serious consequences; however, sleep disturbances and the inability to remember things do not seem to be associated with MS in later life. Sleep difficulties and memory problems are more common among older adults who suffer from other psychiatric conditions such as depression or anxiety disorders.\r

\r


In fact, many patients with MS also experience sleep disturbance symptoms, even though they do not have a specific diagnosis of MS.\r


Sleep problems and the lack of recollection of memories may result from a variety of reasons, including excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating, and poor recall of information during periods of wakefulness. Unfortunately, studies examining the causes of these problems are limited because so few participants have been evaluated using standard cognitive testing methods, resulting in underpowered studies (e.g., see [24]). In addition, clinical observations often fail to address the issue of the role of mood and personality changes in memory loss and the ability to retain information. Therefore, future research should investigate whether MS affects aspects of personality/psychological functioning in relation to memory impairment, focusing on possible mechanisms involving memory-related brain abnormalities and emotional regulation behaviors.\r

What does this mean for parents who choose to vaccinate their children against a common disease? How should parents interpret information about safety and efficacy from different vaccines?

Vaccines may have different responses to the same illness or condition if they are given at the same time by different people. For example, some vaccinations can cause nausea when given to one person. Other vaccines that are similar in structure but differ in how they are administered might also cause nausea in certain individuals (for example, flu vaccines). In addition, different types of vaccines may be able to produce different results depending on whether they are given as monovalent or polyvalent vaccines, which means that there might be differences between them even among the same vaccine type. Because of these concerns, manufacturers should consider giving individualized instructions for vaccination based on the symptoms experienced by each individual before administering a particular vaccine. Some other examples include:

The influenza vaccine contains an adjuvant, such as aluminum hydroxide. Although a significant amount of aluminum was removed during manufacturing, the risk of severe side effects remains. Thus, it is important to check with your health care provider before getting the influenza vaccine because you may be at increased risk for complications.

Are you thinking about becoming involved in research for MS treatment? If so, what should I expect?

If you're considering getting involved in research for MS treatment, here are some important things to consider before joining an organization that may work together toward a common goal:

1. Consider the project's background and its goals carefully. This includes determining the potential impact of the project on individuals living with MS. A team composed of people from different backgrounds who have similar expertise will likely find differences in their responses to MS-related questions. And even though everyone would like to help, different groups might take radically different approaches, such as asking those with MS to focus only on symptoms while focusing on ""normal"" behaviors or activities; or those with MS taking patients' reports at face value but ignoring any side effects that may be associated with these behaviors or activities. As a result, each group may come up with slightly different answers. The good news is that the researchers behind the project already know what works, which means that they've got experience with making decisions based on the best available evidence. It also means that the researchers want all participants to agree on the outcome of the study--so everyone gets equally much out of the research.2. Make sure that your interests in MS are aligned with the investigators' goals for the project. As with most scientific projects, there are benefits and costs associated with being part of a consortium. But overall, the cost savings to participating organizations is often enough to offset the benefits received by others from cooperating with the project.3. Be informed about the risks and rewards of collaborating with any research group or organization involving yourself in research related to MS. Although some research is done without any specific knowledge about the individual patient, scientists must always be cautious about treating patients who haven't yet had symptoms. Many new treatments for MS may affect someone differently than those who were previously treated because of genetic or inherited characteristics. Furthermore, researchers conducting research aimed at understanding the underlying mechanisms underlying MS do so under the assumption that the person receiving treatment won't become ill again--even if that belief turns",79,Can I pass multiple sclerosis to other family members?,-0.0636218413710594,0,question,6,0.0,447,12

Response to the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention Study Group Questionnaire (NCCPSGQ)


National Council on Health Care Quality in the United States, 2006

The questionnaires used were developed by NCHCQ to collect information from a random sample of U.S. adults aged 18 years or older who had been screened for breast cancer at any point during their lifetime. The questionnaires included questions about symptoms associated with these symptoms, such as chest pain, fever, and fatigue. Additionally, the questionnaires asked about physical activity and smoking habits, which are known risk factors for breast cancer.[1]

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide and has become one of the leading causes of death among men worldwide. About 50% of women will experience invasive breast cancer within their lifetimes. In the United States, nearly 14 million women are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer annually.[2] Breast cancer is more prevalent in black than white women;[3] it also occurs less frequently in Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, and Native American women compared with Caucasian women.[4][5]

More information about breast health and screening can be found on the CDC's website, www.cdc.gov/breastcancer.

Results

Table 1 provides an overview of survey results from 2007 that include summary statistics regarding specific types of breast cancers (BRCA1 and BRCA2), the number of breast cancer cases in the study population (1,857,743 women and 597,907 men), incidence rates, mortality, and quality of life scores (based on five subscales). Because the NHANES was conducted using self-administered questionnaire instruments, there may have been bias in some cases due to nonresponse. However, given the relatively small number of cases reported, the observed differences between the two groups did not reflect this issue. Table 2 summarizes findings related to specific characteristics of patients identified through both questionnaires and clinical examination. As noted above, women with no history of breast cancer were slightly younger, had lower body mass index and waist circumference and higher levels of education. Women in the highest quintile of income, education, and age at first birth tended to have less advanced stage BRCA2 tumors, while those in the lowest quintile had a greater likelihood of developing breast cancer than did those in the top quintile.[6] This finding suggests",116,outcome prostate cancer,-12.342822074890137,221,question,6,0.8911290322580645,372,11

What is the prognosis for Multiple Sclerosis?

The prognosis for your own health is far more important than the prognosis you get from having another's disease. It will vary depending on the type and severity of the condition, where you live, what you do for work, if you have any family or close friends who are affected by the disease, etc. The main factors that determine the prognosis include: age, gender, blood types, ethnicity, history of medical conditions, ability to take medication and how active you are in the treatment program.

There is no specific set prognosis that has been established yet. The best advice I can give you is this; keep yourself healthy and active. If you have problems controlling your body weight, exercising regularly, taking supplements and consuming certain foods, consult an endocrinologist and dietitian before doing anything drastic. Don't wait until you feel like you are dying to address these issues. If you need treatment to treat your medical condition, talk to your doctor about whether there might be something that can help.

I have MS and have found several websites that discuss ways you can stop the progression of my illness and improve my quality of life. What should I read first?

For people with multiple sclerosis (MS), it is not known whether stopping all medications will prevent the onset of multiple sclerosis. This is because there is currently no way to tell whether medications used to manage MS will make their way into the bloodstream, especially when they come off-label.

If your symptoms continue after stopping all medications, it is highly likely that you will have serious complications resulting from prolonged use of these medications. In addition, patients with MS often require additional care beyond their regular medicine regimen, including psychological counseling.

In some cases, people have started using ""off label"" drugs without consulting their doctors. For example, one well-known drug that was approved for MS, natalizumab, is now being prescribed to treat Crohn's Disease in patients already receiving immunosuppressant chemotherapy. The side effects of natalizumab are similar to those of the current standard of care treatment for MS, so it is unlikely that patients would receive the same benefits.

If You Have A Big Back, Stretch Your Shoulders First

You don't have to go all the way down and squeeze everything that moves. Some people will just feel their spine ""tugging"" on the floor, and it's fine for them because they only had one muscle. If your spine has problems moving, maybe just doing some light stretching helps. Just start with 30 seconds on each side and work up from there. I recommend getting out of your chair and stretching in front of the mirror so you can see how much space you have to move through. Start out by bending forward at the waist. Bend your knees, take your arms behind your head, push off the ground with your lower legs (as shown) and then slide down until your feet hit the floor, pressing hard against the floor. Do 1-3 reps for your upper back and 5-10 for your lower back, taking care not to hyperextend the knee joint. Take care not to hurt yourself while doing this, as the stretch is fairly easy to do. Repeat 10 times. This stretch works both the mid-back and the lumbar region. Once you've done this, try standing up without your hands holding anything or with your elbows in front of you and pushing yourself into the wall. Again, do 2-5 reps per arm, using the same exercise order.

Do 3 Sets For The Arms And 4 For The Legs

This stretch works primarily in the traps, chest, and triceps. To perform it: Stand facing a wall with your arms straight overhead, and slowly raise your palms toward the ceiling, palms facing away from you. Now, turn around and hold with your thumbs facing towards your torso, palms facing inward. Pause for a second, then rotate your torso 180 degrees, squeezing your abs together and pushing the arms out as far as possible. Keep your arms still and repeat for 5-8 repetitions. This stretch also works the bicep, elbow flexors, and latissimus dorsi (lats). For the legs, do the opposite exercise, but bend your ankles so the knees stay bent even when lowering.

What is the average age at which patients first start receiving radiation therapy? Answer: 55 years, according to the American College of Radiology\n

Is there any difference in the treatment effectiveness between low and high risk subgroups in patients who have had multiple procedures? Answer: No\n

In the current study, when we evaluated the risk of death, we did not identify any differences in mortality between subgroups as defined by the presence or absence of other diseases and tumors. The only indication of higher mortality in high risk subgroup was the occurrence of lymphoma as compared to those without lymphoma. Therefore, no conclusions can be drawn about whether these risks will change if further studies are conducted. We also included a comparison group of patients whose disease was well controlled before surgery, but after they underwent surgery were diagnosed with disease, their tumor was removed, or they underwent some other type of invasive procedure. In all, 2200 patients from 18 centers participated in our analysis. To summarize, we found that the following factors may affect the survival rate of metastatic lung cancer patients: 1) patient characteristics; 2) time from diagnosis to randomization; 3) site of entry, 4) amount of radiation given, 5) number of adjuvant agents used, 6) timing of radiation exposure, 7) number of previous surgeries performed, and 8) number of previously treated lymphomas. As mentioned earlier, the data show that the mean overall survival with single dose radiation is 81% with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.964. In addition, while we detected no significant differences in incidence rates among groups at baseline (p =.14), we observed significant reductions at every 5-year interval. For example, at year 8, we saw an increase of 19% in the median age of patients receiving single dose radiation versus 39% in the matched control group, whereas in year 9, the difference was 20%. We have identified two possible mechanisms responsible for these improvements in overall survival. First, we found that the use of adjuvant agents significantly increased the probability of achieving complete remission without further treatments (hazard ratio, 0.962).

What does psychotherapy look like? When you are feeling down or distressed, you might try talking about it with someone who knows what you are going through. Sometimes you need to talk to somebody who has been there before and understands what you really want. If possible, let your therapist know that you are ready to talk about something important; however, you must be very clear about exactly what you want to say. You can use this kind of information to develop a plan of action to deal with whatever problems you are having right now. Therapy is not about changing things inside your head; rather, it is about helping you recognize those parts of yourself that aren't working at the moment. While some types of therapy involve talking about specific problems, others involve examining aspects of your life that you think are bothering you. It might help to write down everything you've ever thought of as ""bad"" about yourself, then read this list of these bad thoughts so that you can start making changes. Once you start thinking about how things could be different, your mind will begin to question itself. Psychotherapists sometimes try to encourage such questioning with questions such as this one: What should I tell myself that would encourage me to stop being unhappy? Or, what words of encouragement can I give to myself to help me get rid of negative beliefs?\r

The most common, severe case is acute diarrhea lasting 2 days or more, often accompanied by abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, fever, malaise (fatigue), and/or loss of appetite. This condition causes the patient to have a difficult time remaining calm and rational, which makes it hard for them to keep their jobs and maintain control over their health. Chronic diarrhea also frequently results in dehydration, which may cause skin ulcers, kidney disease, and, in some cases, death.

Treatment: If symptoms persist after 48 hours of treatment, or if they worsen during recovery, consult a physician.

If you're concerned that your medical records might be compromised by your personal or family history of food allergies or autoimmune diseases, seek out an allergy specialist who specializes in dealing with food intolerance. An allergist will identify specific foods that should not be eaten in order to reduce your risk of developing an allergic reaction and prevent further damage.

And the answer is: There are many different things you can do about this:


-You could use an adjustable pillow, which would allow you to set the height slightly above your jawline, and give you a comfortable fit with no problem at all.

-Or you could get one of those high neck pillows that looks like something out of a movie (I don't know if they're still around) and keep it up so that it doesn't fall down when you try to sleep.

-You could always lie on your back, but this might be uncomfortable for your neck to handle when you have a wide area of neck pressure.

-Finally, there is something called ""cable tension"", which involves tying a small knot under your hair and then tightening it by pulling and pushing until you feel the knot pop free from your scalp without any pain. If you'd rather just go with wearing a loose shirt and pants you can try doing this. The main thing to remember is that if you want to wear a loose shirt and pants you should wear them long enough so that the collar is going to hang loose.If you've done all of these things (and your neck hurts while sleeping), you probably won't need to worry about it as much anymore. The most important thing to note here though is that it usually helps to rest after using the pillow, whether it's a pillow, foam, etc., so it's worth trying to rest in between uses.",119,best pillow neck pain,-0.9300973415374756,54,question,6,0.31952662721893493,318,8

gpt2-large_112,"You may get more severe when the air is not as dry and there are less clouds. When the air is wet and cloudy, you might also get asthma symptoms but they would be milder than those from allergic rhinitis.

How can I tell if I have asthma? Answer: Asthma is a disease that occurs in people who have an immune system deficiency. The condition is caused by chronic inflammation in your lungs. These small air sacs called alveoli secrete mucus to protect your lungs. If your skin becomes inflamed or irritated, it can cause flare-ups of airways inflammation which causes asthma.


This disease is most often found in children who live with their parents or grandparents or other family members with asthma. It is usually diagnosed when someone has been in an emergency room for 10 years or longer. In many cases, this means a parent or grandparent was treated in an ER after suffering from frequent attacks, especially at night.


Children with asthmatic episodes can become very sick within minutes without any warning signs. Even infants and young toddlers can experience these problems. Symptoms of asthma include coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightening, and difficulty breathing. Your doctor will examine you to see whether you have a history of allergies or asthma. He/she may recommend medical testing such as blood tests or echocardiograms (heart rate monitors).


If you feel like you're having trouble breathing, you'll need immediate care. For example, you could call 911 immediately if you've had a deep cough or wheeze, or if you think you can't breathe normally because your upper body hurts too much. Ask your doctor what type of test he recommends to confirm your diagnosis.

Asthma Facts

There are four types of asthma: acute, chronic, seasonal, and chronic relapsing. There are three main types of asthma attacks: positive and negative. Children have two types of asthma: acute attacks, which occur between the ages of 2 months and 3 years old; and continuous or recurrent, which occur after age 5 years. Children with either type of asthma require long term health care services.

What causes my asthma attack? Answer: Certain conditions make the air inside the lung grow thicker or heavier. This thickens the airway and makes it harder to clear. A person's chances of developing an asthma attack increase if she: has asthma, has recently undergone surgery, was admitted to the hospital with symptoms that lasted less than 1 hour",112,symptoms of asthma,-0.2124635577201843,9,question,7,0.04285714285714286,409,22

gpt2-large_83,"As Dr. Michael D. Davidson, M.D., explains in an article titled ""Multiple Sclerosis and the Medical Bias"", MS is considered to be a progressive disease, which means that patients with MS eventually develop relapses. This can happen for many reasons, including poor treatment (for example, drugs like steroids are often given when a patient has not had any symptoms) or a change in lifestyle that leads to more frequent attacks. Sometimes the changes don't cause a relapse but just make it harder to control MS symptoms. For this reason, doctors may recommend getting MS tested at least once every five years.

What's a good way to know if your condition is a relapsing one? In fact, you might have already been told to see a neurologist in case you got MS from something else. However, most people don't realize that they should also go see their primary care physician as well. The doctor who treats you will usually treat a whole range of diseases, so he or she would probably be able to tell whether MS was causing these problems. And even if the problem doesn't seem to be caused by MS itself, the doctor may still want to check in on how your situation has changed over time. Also, since the symptoms of MS tend to worsen in response to therapy, the doctor might ask about other treatments. Finally, there are several medical conditions for which there is a great deal of anecdotal evidence suggesting an association between MS and some kind of neurological dysfunction, such as ALS. Although it's possible that all of these factors contribute to the development of MS, it would certainly take a lot of research before we could say with certainty that they do.

Can You Get Diagnosed With Multiple Sclerosis Without Having Symptoms? \nYes, indeed! But what causes it? What does it look like? How does it affect your life? Well, here's where things become complicated. There are two ways to get diagnosed: through a blood test called a biopsy and by doing a physical exam. If you have been told that you have MS, then you need to meet with a doctor who specializes in MS to discuss your options. The best way to find out if you have MS is to visit an MS specialist. Even though MS isn't known to cause symptoms, it does occasionally occur after being treated effectively, as with neuropathy or Parkinson's disease. So, if your symptoms disappear within months or years of starting MS medications, then you won't have MS. Likewise, if your symptoms start again, you",83,Why get episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis?,-0.0108362082391977,0,question,7,0.0,431,51

This makes the most sense for patients who have a good prognosis but are at high risk of complications and side effects from chemotherapy. Then they need to decide whether to continue on the same medication or switch over to a different one. This may be the best option if the new therapy seems better than what they had before. If not, they should ask their doctor about switching to a brand-name (brand name=generic), newer form of drug that has fewer adverse effects. For example, some drugs that were used in stage 3/4 cancers like BRCA1 and CCR5 inhibitors have been shown to work well in stage 2/3 tumors. If there's no improvement in the new treatment after several months, your doctor will probably prescribe another drug such as an antiproliferative agent or hormone therapy.",118,stage 4 triple negative breast cancer treatment,-12.053707122802734,134,question,7,0.600896860986547,175,3

However, if you are thinking about getting a degree, look into the many opportunities available in the MS community—there is an enormous amount of information for students looking to learn more about the disease.

Q: What should I tell my family or friends when I talk about having MS?

A: This is one area where it seems like everyone's opinion has been heard. Some of our patients have told us that telling their families will help them feel better about their condition. Others say that telling someone close to you what your illness means will make you feel less alone. Still others have said that they've felt very lucky that their loved ones knew. But it is important to remember that sometimes there is no right way to handle these situations. For instance, you may wish to speak at length with someone whom you think would benefit from knowing how difficult it is for people to live with MS (for example, a healthcare provider), or you might decide to share your own experiences of living with the disease without giving away too much personal information (for example, by sharing your feelings). Either way, try to keep your words short and simple so as not to overwhelm your audience or leave them feeling overwhelmed themselves.

Q: How does MS affect my ability to get along with other people?

A: When we hear someone saying something negative about MS, some of us are concerned that she/he may be blaming us for her/his symptoms. Asking questions such as ""how long have you had MS"" often helps answer those questions, but it also creates space for us to respond with empathy and understanding. Sometimes, though, some of our patients aren't aware that the answer to this question can be difficult to come up with in light of the complexity of the disorder itself. So before you ask the question, try to find out why the person was asking the question. Often times, patients don't realize that someone else may not understand their situation, either because they didn't experience it firsthand, they're unsure about what to say, or they didn't realize that any type of explanation would be helpful. In any case, talking things through makes the experience far easier.

When asked these types of questions, most people with MS will relate two different stories. One story may be a little easier for you to digest than the second; therefore, you need to consider both before responding.

For instance, a patient may",81,Can I work and study full-time with multiple sclerosis?,-2.989611387252808,5,question,7,0.0228310502283105,436,13
gpt2-large_77,"There is no direct correlation between the two. The diagnosis of MS in women does not exclude any other medical conditions and, in fact, many women with MS have other illnesses such as cancer or diabetes that can interfere with their menstrual cycles, which could be a possible contributing factor for these symptoms. It should also be noted that there may be genetic factors involved in both MS and menstruation.

Q: What are some other reasons why menstrual cycle problems might occur in people with MS?

A: Many MS patients report difficulty maintaining normal fertility because they experience pain during periods. In addition, other symptoms of MS, including nausea and dizziness, may cause significant discomfort during menstruation. For example, the following symptoms may increase blood flow to the uterus (amenorrhea) and lead to bleeding during your period: dizziness

diarrhoea

headache

chest pain

dyspnea

fainting Q: Do you think MS causes menstrual irregularities? A: Yes. MS is associated with an increased risk of menstrual irregularity; however, it is important to note that MS can result from several different conditions, so the exact cause of the problem cannot be established conclusively. Therefore, it is very important to evaluate whether one's own health status plays a role in creating a problematic menstrual cycle.

Q: What are the most common types of MS symptoms?

A: Other than MS itself, the most commonly reported MS symptoms include fatigue, depression, headache, anxiety, joint pain, infertility problems, mood changes, sexual dysfunction, rheumatoid arthritis and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Of course, some of these symptoms are associated with other diseases as well, including cancer, kidney disease, and autoimmune disorders. However, because MS affects more than 10 percent of all women who get diagnosed, and because of its increasing incidence over time, MS has become one of the top ten leading causes of female disability worldwide.

In addition, MS appears to affect women differently depending on their age. Women 65 years or older tend to have a higher rate of migraine headaches, depression, and fatigue than younger women do. Additionally, women with MS are less likely to develop breast cancer and cervical cancer. However, those women who develop MS within the last decade are at increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Finally, researchers believe that the overall number of new cases of MS will continue to rise due to the aging population, which will eventually require greater care and",77,How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?,-0.0880948305130004,2,question,7,0.008264462809917356,403,15

The answer to this question was ""No"" because the wisdom teeth don't need to be crushed to dissolve the gum, they are just being broken. The reason that you can see a tiny hole in the center of the wisdom tooth is because the gums have been pushed up into the top of the tooth, when this happens it causes some blood to pool around the area where the teeth were and this prevents the blood from flowing out (like a sieve). If you look closely at the photo above, you'll notice that the white part on the bottom right is actually the ""sieve"", which keeps all the blood away from the area where the teeth have started to come out.

You can ask your boss or supervisor when they might be willing to come into your office and talk about something personal related to MS, such as a family member's death or an ongoing illness (for example, when you go through a period where you feel ill). 2) Try to make sure that your health insurance covers all forms of disability benefits. This includes any medications you receive and other treatments, including physical therapy and occupational therapy. 3) Look into getting professional help, and if possible find someone who has experience treating people with MS to discuss options. 4) Ask your bosses and supervisors to provide support as best as possible for you while you're dealing with this disease. They may be able to offer advice like scheduling appointments, providing referrals, making suggestions for effective communication between you and your doctor and more. 5) Be careful not to let negative stereotypes affect your approach to treating people with MS, because most of us tend to treat others with respect instead of scorn (see the interview below). It would also be helpful if you could avoid speaking negatively about people with MS by avoiding using words like ""crazy"" and ""mentally retarded."" 6) In case you decide to seek out medical care, check the guidelines of state Medicaid programs and Medicaid offices about coverage.

How much does a ketogenic diet cost you?

It depends on how far along you have gotten into your program and how many years you've been diabetic. However, you can usually expect to pay anywhere between $150-$300 for a complete ketogenic diet. This includes everything from meal replacement shakes to customized nutrition plans.

What kind of protein do I need to eat to lose weight?

The amount of protein needed varies greatly depending upon where you fall on the BMI scale. Low-calorie diets such as low carb, low fat or Keto will help those with diabetes and prediabetic conditions achieve the best results.

Should I follow a ketogenic diet when my blood sugar levels get too high?

There's no evidence that a ketogenic diet causes hypoglycemia (low blood glucose). A ketogenic diet may even help those with Type 1 Diabetes to lose weight because they burn more calories than they take in during a normal day.

How long will it last?

A ketogenic diet may last up to 2 weeks on average. If you have diabetes and want to lose some weight, this could prove to be very helpful.

If you are receiving a combination of two or more therapies (eg, steroids), your symptoms may start to improve within several weeks after starting therapy. However, if you have only one therapy and your symptoms are severe, they can take longer to respond. It is not clear why this delay occurs but it is likely related to the fact that some medications work by changing how cells communicate with each other and thus affect how well the immune system treats them. As long as the medicine keeps working, the body will keep fighting off the disease. Treatment options For most people who want to stop MS medications completely, there are three main types of treatments available: anti-inflammatory drugs called immunosuppressants

antibiotics such as amoxicillin and penicillin

blood pressure medication called ACE inhibitors. The first four all require you to get regular blood tests before treatment starts and then every couple months afterward. After six weeks of taking these medicines, you should be able to resume doing normal activities. You might need to go back to your doctor for more frequent blood testing and follow-up appointments. People who have been diagnosed with HIV infection usually have their MS medication stopped right away once they've had a few weeks of undetectable viral levels in their blood. In rare cases, medications used to treat certain cancers may cause problems. These include chemotherapy drugs like temozolomide, carboplatin and cyclophosphamide, which may slow down or stop the healing process. A blood test showing a low level of antibodies against cancer-causing genes might also prompt an early discontinuation of a particular drug. Another option is to switch from one type of immunotherapy drug to another (such as an antibody called MOG-1). While MOG-1 isn't approved for use in the US, it's widely available in Europe. Because MOG-1 doesn't interfere with the functioning of the immune system, most doctors recommend switching over when the new version appears to be safer than the old one. Other drugs may make it harder for you to eat, drink or sleep, so talk to your doctor about possible alternatives. Your doctor probably won't recommend stopping most of the different therapies until you're no longer sick, because a change in medication could lead to serious side effects.

What is my risk of complications during pregnancy? Answer: Most women develop some degree of pain during labor but this is temporary and usually goes away on its own within a few days after giving birth. For most people, however, complications don't occur until much later in pregnancy. They often start early in the first trimester, before they get into the second stage of labor and often begin to happen even before childbirth has started! The most likely cause of any type of complication is severe pelvic infection so make sure to see your obstetrician or midwife soon after delivery!

How do I prepare myself before giving birth? Answer: The first thing you should do is to read everything you read online on vaginal births, birthing, postpartum periods and breastfeeding before you come to labour! Also, make sure you watch videos such as C-section video tutorials and read more books to learn more about the process, especially if you've never had a c-section before. Also check out the various resources available at www.vaginalbirths.org.

Is there anything else I should know when giving birth? Answer: Don't worry if you don't understand anything that comes along with giving birth! There are lots of great information sites online, both written and visual, and there are tons of blogs about all sorts of different things.

How Can I Tell If My MS Is Bad?

Once a diagnosis has been made about you and your MS, doctors will begin making plans. Your doctor will tell you if there's anything he/she wants to do to help improve your condition (such as taking medication), if there's something they're worried about (like surgery) and how long you'll need to stay in the hospital before you get better. They'll also ask you questions such as: How many years have you had MS?

Have you ever lost more than 25% of your blood volume due to MS?

Are you willing to talk to your surgeon?

What kinds of medications will you need for your disease?

What types of treatments will you want to use?

If you have children or grandchildren, will they care for them?

Will you be able to work at the same level or above when you're fully recovered?

Does the loss of one limb make you feel sad? Or does the loss of one limb make you laugh?

Do you know what type of exercise you'd like to do after getting back into work? When you recover? And even more important, how much money would you be willing to pay to keep working? Some people who have MS will try to explain their situation to the doctor to see how comfortable he/she is being honest. They might say, ""I've always thought of myself as different, but I couldn't stand up straight without a cane."" While the information that the doctor receives might seem unusual, it's normal for everyone else in their position to have similar feelings. The only way to really know the answer to these questions is by talking to another doctor – sometimes the doctor can give you a list of questions the doctor expects patients to answer for themselves. These are some typical questions asked by someone with MS: What kind of medicine do you usually take every day?

Long-Term Effects and Risk for Multiple Sclerosis

Multiple Sclerosis is a disease that results in an immune disorder that affects a person's ability to regulate his or her body's immune system. The body's immune system fights off diseases such as cancer, viral infections, infectious diseases, bacterial infections, influenza, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B/C, arthritis, Parkinson's disease and AIDS. It also attacks tissues such as the brain and spinal cord, causing these tissues to malfunction, or atrophy. The damage caused by multiple sclerosis occurs on a cellular level, meaning it does not occur at one point but rather over time (in the context of the disease). This leads to chronic inflammation, which can lead to neurological complications. These symptoms include joint pain, numbness, tingling and other sensations associated with peripheral neuropathy, including headaches, depression, memory loss, difficulty concentrating, fatigue and even blindness. Neurological issues can be severe enough that people who have them may need medical attention. For example, patients may find that their cognitive functions are reduced and they may require a wheelchair due to muscle weakness or paralysis. There can be no cure for this type of disability.",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-0.012930710799992,0,question,7,0.0,204,8

A symptom is any physical or mental sign, such as muscle weakness, loss of function, pain in the face, dizziness or nausea that happens when the body's immune systems are activated. There are no symptoms for people who have MS, but many people with MS do not know they have this disease because they don't realize they're suffering from it. This condition affects approximately 1 percent of all Americans. People with MS may experience fatigue, joint problems, vision problems, headaches, joint stiffness or trouble walking, memory loss or concentration issues. They also may have changes in their bowel movements and urine. Some people find that their muscles become stiff and crampy after they move. Others may feel like they have constant pain or numbness. Many patients say their health has improved since they've had treatment. However, some people with MS never recover fully. People with MS often report feeling tired after having treatments, even though they felt fine before getting those treatments. In most cases, the illness doesn't go away completely, but symptoms sometimes improve within two to three years.

What causes multiple sclerosis?\n Answer: There are several theories about what causes MS. A genetic predisposition plays a role in causing this disease. The cause of MS can vary from person to person depending upon a number of factors. These include age, gender, genetics, diet, environmental exposures, medications, and other lifestyle factors. Because there is no cure, prevention is key in preventing MS. To learn more about how to prevent MS, see Preventing MS.

A. I would be concerned about how the person was behaving. This could be a problem for you as well because there is no way to know whether it's true or not.

This can cause problems for parents who are trying to parent with these individuals. If your child has had one of these disorders and may also have a history of some other psychiatric illness such as bipolar disorder, then I would feel comfortable contacting them and asking them to tell me everything that happened during this period in their life, including what was said to them about this mental health issue.

BPD Symptoms and Behavior - Diagnostic Information

What Is BPD Like?

The DSM-IV describes BPD as:

(1) An enduring pattern of unstable interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating periods of intense instability (depression, mania, rage), marked by impulsive and antisocial behavior, with a tendency toward grandiosity and impulsivity;

(2) Avoidant/restrictive mood states (anhedonia, apathy);

(3) A need for constant stimulation (inability to engage in activities that most other people find pleasurable); and

(4) Frequent lying, manipulation, and conning behaviors.

These four characteristics of BPD make it very difficult for someone suffering from BPD to change into healthy, happy behavior. The individual experiences high levels of depression, hostility, and anger, so there is often little hope of success.

There are many different types of BPD in which the mood swings are cyclical. Some patients experience cycles of extreme highs and lows for years at a time. Others experience cycles of extremes. Most are characterized by two distinct phases each lasting months or even years, but there are several subtypes of BPD such as Obsessive Compulsive BPD and Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). In spite of the fact that BPD is a condition often misdiagnosed, there is still much research going on in this area. It is recommended that you talk to a qualified psychiatrist or psychologist before making any decisions regarding treatment.

[top]

I just want to know why my symptoms are different from those of someone with normal TSH.

Hypothyroidism symptoms may not be as common in females because of female reproductive hormones. You also should not assume that a person with hypothyroidism has high levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). People who don't produce SHBG often have low TSH values (less than 7.0 mIU/L), which may indicate an increased level of estrogen or progesterone and/or a lowered production of DHEAS (the hormone responsible for converting testosterone into estradiol) by the liver, adrenal glands, pituitary gland, and testicles. There is no evidence linking elevated TSH levels to estrogen or progesterone problems, and some studies suggest that higher TSH levels may be associated with increased risk of developing prostate cancer.[1] [2][3]

What causes hypothyroidism?

While it's clear that thyroid function plays a role in determining whether one develops hypothyroidism or not, the exact mechanism behind this relationship is unclear.[4][5] One possibility is that abnormalities of the hypothalamus (a region within the brain involved in regulating body temperature), as well as the immune system, lead to an imbalance of the thyroid hormone receptors (TRs).[6][7] While there is no conclusive evidence of this theory, it seems likely to explain at least part of the variation in hypothyroid symptoms found between individuals.

Another possible explanation involves the action of a thyroid hormone called thyroxine. Thyroid hormones are produced mainly by the thyroid gland. However, some cells in the body produce more T 3 than others. A specific type of cell in the pituitary gland makes large quantities of TRs, whereas other cells make smaller amounts of TRs. This means that certain types of cells, such as the microtubule transport system (MTTS), get their energy from circulating T 4 and thus require extra iodine to function properly. Another area where this is true is in the kidneys, where TRs do need to be made up of T 3, though they're not converted into T 4 directly. To compensate, thyroid hormone also requires additional",123,hypothyroidism symptoms,-1.2740285396575928,15,question,7,0.09259259259259259,378,7

Possible Solutions for Multiple Sclerosis

1) Exercise and Diet

For many people who have a history of MS, exercise has proven helpful in managing symptoms and improving function. It is important that you choose exercises that work well for you, as too much or too little exercise can be detrimental to health and progress. Exercise must be balanced to prevent muscle weakness and pain, and to build strength. Ideally, each session should last no longer than 30 minutes. Make sure you include at least 15-30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity three days per week.

2) Immunotherapy

There are numerous immunotherapies available for treating multiple sclerosis, including T cells, cytokines such as interferon and others, steroids, corticosteroids and anti-CD19 antibodies. Each type has different benefits and side effects, so it's best to determine which one works best for you before starting treatment. Some patients prefer to use one approach while other patients will find more effectiveness by combining two approaches.

The following strategies are considered effective treatments for multiple sclerosis; however, some studies do show mixed results and some research suggests there may be additional potential benefits from combination therapies. Keep in mind that many types of immune reactions may interfere with each other and cause an increase in risk of developing autoimmune disease. If your doctors recommend any of these options, make sure they are safe and effective for you.

3) Immunosuppressants

Inflammation, which occurs when certain proteins bind together, causes inflammation and scarring in many inflammatory disorders, especially in MS. A common immunosuppressive therapy is cortisone. Cortisone reduces inflammation and increases blood flow and oxygen supply within the brain, helping reduce muscle spasms and improved movement. However, this drug may decrease the body's ability to produce new nerve endings, making symptoms worse over time. In addition, this drug can lead to serious problems such as blindness. Patients taking cortisone are advised to avoid activities like playing sports, traveling and eating high protein foods.


4) Surgery

Surgery can greatly improve patient outcome with respect to relapses, disability and cognitive decline. Recent studies suggest that surgery alone may significantly slow down the progression of MS symptoms.

I am sure you have heard of this, but Microsoft Word cannot open PDF files (like.doc or.xls format) as it doesn't support them. You need to use another application such as Adobe Reader (which has both a text and pdf file support). It is important to note that some documents may require other programs such as Acrobat for saving or printing.


Question: I'm having trouble opening the word document at all. Is there any way that I can fix my problem?

Answer: First of all you must understand how Microsoft Word works. As a matter of fact, it is much harder to edit words than photos or images. So if you want to edit your own words, make sure you keep all the formatting intact. Also remember that words are made up of many small letters. So the first thing you must do is write down what each letter stands for before writing anything else. This means that in order to change what a word stands for, you will need to find the place where a specific letter is written on the page (such as 'a' when referring to the A-word). If you look closely at the picture above you will notice that the second A-word appears after 'a'. However this does not mean that you need to add that letter in front of the word 'A', however this would be better than changing the whole letter altogether. Now we are going to take a look at how Microsoft Word deals with different types of pages. Some of these pages are very simple while others are quite difficult. Let's start by looking at this example.


If you were to go back into Word and type ""a"" instead of simply typing it, Word would display your input correctly. Therefore, if you were to type ""a"" without using a space between the two letters, then there would still be nothing on the screen because the space would just disappear. However, if you try to enter the same letter in this manner, Word will also treat your input correctly. For example, if you typed the word ""a"" with a period between it and ""a"", Word would not interpret that as ""a"".",95,Reading problems in MS,-10.936742782592772,160,question,7,0.7582938388625592,429,3

Q: Is it a requirement to use the word ""Windows"" as opposed to the word ""Operating System""?

Answer: No. The term Windows is used by OEMs, and we recommend that you do not refer to any other operating system. If you are referring to a specific OS version, such as Windows 7, or an older OS version, then ""XP"" is fine as well.

There are also situations where you may want to avoid using certain words on the product name or box in order to make your work more clear and concise. For example, ""Win 7,"" would be confusing for some consumers when they see this type of language. Similarly, ""Microsoft Word 2003"" could be confusing for customers who have never heard of Microsoft Office before!

If you really need to use the word ""Windows"" because of technical considerations (for example, the fact that Windows is often installed on CD-ROMs) the following guidelines should help:

Use the words ""operating system"" instead of ""system."" Use a capitalized abbreviation of ""OS"" such as ""Windows"" or ""Microsoft Windows"" instead of the standard abbreviations such as ""MS-DOS"" or ""WINDOWS""

Use the word ""Windows"" and/or ""Windows XP""

Cessation of activity in a particular area of the brain has been reported to improve muscle strength and decrease muscle stiffness [6]. However, this has only been found to occur after 4 weeks[7] and a more complicated mechanism seems to have to play a role. The study by Hernández-Fernandez et al. found ""a correlation between the magnitude of improvement and the duration of the intervention"" but did not provide any explanation for the correlation. Also it must be noted that ""the study had limited statistical power, which limits the reliability of our results.""

Some researchers think this fatigue may be caused by a decline in the activity of specific cells within the muscles themselves. Other researchers suggest that fatigue could be due to ""tiredness induced during exercise"" [8], although they do not know why this might happen in healthy people. There is also evidence from animal studies suggesting that exercise can increase levels of serotonin, a mood regulator. While the effect of exercise on serotonin hasn't been studied in humans yet, there is some evidence that exercising increases dopamine levels in the brains of rats; however, this doesn't seem to help with fatigue [9]. So far all the studies that have looked at whether physical exercise helps reduce symptoms of fatigue have found that it does, and the research isn't conclusive so take those findings with a grain of salt.

Another possible reason for increased fatigue is that the body's immune system is damaged due to aging and/or disease. If you've ever taken immunosuppressant drugs such as warfarin or cyclophosphamide, then you're probably familiar with the feelings that you get when taking these medications for months without a break. Researchers think that if older adults were given vitamin C supplementation throughout their lives instead of taking them every few years like many Americans, their immune systems would be able to survive longer and fight off infections better, which may explain why we see fewer serious illness in elderly people than younger people [10]. Vitamin E supplements have been shown to help lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels in people over 65 [11] though they don't appear to do much for reducing fatigue.

Q: Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis? How does that relate to MS?


A: The primary reason for MS is inflammation and a host of other illnesses including cancers, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus, obesity, heart disease and stroke. However many people don't realize it is just as important for the immune system to attack those diseases as it is to protect against the inflammation caused by these conditions. When you have multiple sclerosis you also have an increased risk of developing cancer of the breast, prostate and colon because your body doesn't function correctly under stress.


As far as the secondary progressive multiple sclerosis thing, this is actually a type of secondary progressive Multiple Sclerosis which affects about 10 percent of all cases of MS and often doesn't require any treatment at all. If you already had MS before and were still being treated with steroids or other medications in addition to therapy, then if your MS became worse, the cause was likely not because of MS but rather you developed secondary progressive multiple sclerosis after getting off treatment. It's rare, but if you are treating yourself you should see a doctor about it!",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-0.0119861364364624,2,question,7,0.015037593984962405,202,17
gpt2-large_93,"Yes, multiple sclerosis is associated with sleep disturbances (e.g., insomnia).

Sleeping disorders and memory impairment

Sleeping problems are one of the most common medical conditions for which research has been conducted on treatment. The two primary sources that have been used to examine this topic include studies using standard sleep tests such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index or the Stanford Sleepiness Scale and clinical trials of medications like melatonin and benzodiazepines (such as alprazolam) [2]. Although both approaches have their limitations, they do provide valuable information about the prevalence of symptoms and the extent to which these affect the ability to function. In particular, the more frequent occurrence of symptoms suggests that some underlying cause exists. To date, there is no evidence showing a causal relationship between multiple sclerosis and sleep disturbance, but several recent reviews suggest a possible association, including an article by Littman et al. [3] and another by Zimmet et al.[4]. A Cochrane review found a small positive effect of melatonin therapy for atypical MS on sleep disturbances in individuals who were taking medication [5], although a further study of the same population failed to show any benefit [6]. Although it is true that patients can be prescribed medications to treat insomnia, the authors note that many patients also suffer from other sleep disorders that may interfere with sleep, such as depression or anxiety. They conclude that insomnia does not seem to play a direct role in the development of MS, but rather contributes only indirectly to the disorder's progression through the CNS. This may indicate that the severity of the disease itself influences how well patients can tolerate sleep disturbance, making them susceptible to developing the condition. While numerous studies have shown no relationship between multiple sclerosis and sleep problems, it remains unclear whether the observed effects are due simply to the presence of MS or to the symptoms themselves. For example, some researchers believe that the risk of developing MS is related to the length of time a patient has suffered from the disease [7]; others have suggested that it is not the number of MS cases experienced that determines the course of the disease, but the frequency of relapses [8]. Nevertheless, a large meta-analysis examining data from over 40 studies reported a significantly increased incidence of insomnia and daytime sleepiness among those suffering from MS compared to healthy controls [9]. Although a causative link between MS and sleep disturbances cannot be ruled out, the findings should be interpreted cautiously. Because insomnia and daytime sleepiness are frequently co-morbid conditions, it may be",93,Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?,-0.00283684884198,0,question,7,0.0,428,36

gpt2-large_116,"yes, there are about 1.3 million cases per year. There is a strong link with smoking and other risk factors. However, the exact reasons for this effect are still not clear. It could be due to the fact that the cancer cells are more vulnerable to hormone therapy than normal cells and they are thus able to survive longer in treatment.

In a study conducted by Dr. Jürgen Graf at Johns Hopkins University, he found some interesting results regarding how much testosterone is necessary for prostate cancer patients to achieve a clinical response. He studied men who were either diagnosed with stage IV or III prostate cancer and had undergone surgery for metastatic disease. When comparing patients with advanced cancers who received testosterone therapy (15 micrograms of testosterone every four weeks) versus those receiving placebo injections (no treatment), the researchers saw a decrease in the number of deaths from all causes related to prostate cancer. These patients also experienced a significantly greater improvement in their quality of life after undergoing testosterone therapy. In other words, even though these patients did not receive any additional treatments, their cancer went down in size and, according to one study, the overall survival rate increased.

Another intriguing result was a case study of a man whose prostate cancer started as stage I but then returned as stage IV. Although the patient's doctor gave him an aggressive course of drugs including radiation, chemotherapy and surgery, his prognosis remained pretty good so long as his body produced testosterone. But when the man became overweight and began using steroids, his tumor grew rapidly and reached Stage II. The doctors attempted another round of steroid therapy, but it didn't work out and the man died within two years. After his death, his family asked Dr. Graf if he could take a look at what happened to the cancer cells. What he discovered shocked them. They found that the cancer cells were no longer growing properly because the levels of hormones such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), sex hormones (estradiol and testosterone) and prolactin (a hormone released during sexual activity) had dropped to abnormal levels.

The next step will be determining which therapies work best for each individual man and whether we need to use different doses of testosterone. One thing is certain, however. Testosterone supplements don't cure cancer. That said, they can help treat symptoms of the disease and reduce its frequency over time.

However, because other medical conditions often predispose people to strokes, these findings may be more specific to patients with MS than those with other diseases. Therefore, when evaluating the risks associated with aspirin use in patients with MS or any other condition, physicians should ask about other medications and lifestyle factors as well.

What are some alternatives?

Some individuals will find it difficult to tolerate the drug and avoid taking it altogether, but if you're looking for another option to prevent heart attack, stroke or vascular death, there are several options available.

Consider getting blood tests to check your cholesterol levels or test for signs of hypertension before starting to take aspirin. The American Heart Association recommends daily doses of 300 milligrams (mg) or less of aspirin to lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol. This type of medication also lowers blood pressure and helps protect against stroke. People with high blood pressure should also be advised to consider avoiding alcohol consumption. High amounts of sodium can lead to low platelet counts. Also, high levels of triglycerides can cause fatty deposits around artery walls that can trigger a stroke. Another alternative involves avoiding food containing excessive amounts of saturated fat. Although there's no evidence linking saturated fats to stroke, they are known to increase the risk of certain types of atherosclerosis, which leads to heart attacks. In addition, dietary guidelines recommend limiting animal products such as meat, eggs and dairy products.

There are many other drugs on the market that might help reduce risk for heart disease in the long run. These include statins, beta blockers like warfarin or simvastatin (Silberfloxacin), ACE inhibitors and statin drugs such as Crestor or Lipitor.",58,Risk to develop multiple sclerosis,-4.474464416503906,35,question,7,0.15151515151515152,326,15
gpt2-large_113,"the airways are not closed by means of bronchodilator \s.l.a.t., and therefore inhaled air does not cross to the lungs, but is carried in the sinus passages and passed into the diaphragm through the trachea. The respiratory movements are controlled and regulated by the autonomic nervous system \s.e.\s\s\g\b\r\h\i- nome. The parasympathetic nervous system controls respiration by secreting a hormone called epinephrine which increases the amount of water vapor that enters the blood stream and causes it to be more easily transported across the pulmonary vessels. This increase in the volume of air entering the blood stream causes an increased heart rate. The heart beats faster because there are more molecules being removed from the blood stream during respiration. In addition, the sympathetic nervous system releases adrenaline, which is similar to epinephrine but has greater effects on the heart. The effect of these two hormones in causing the blood flow to be expanded or constricted can also alter the way in which oxygen is absorbed into the cells. For example, if one is breathing in more carbon dioxide than normal, the lungs will receive less oxygen, as well as the other nitrogenous compounds present in the blood. One result of this increased delivery of oxygen is that red blood cell production slows down. When this happens, it makes sense for the body to begin taking in smaller amounts of blood, increasing the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Another possible cause for this slowing down of blood supply is an imbalance between certain proteins within the red blood cells and the red blood cells themselves. If this protein imbalances have been caused by excessive intake of carbohydrates such as starches (white flour, rice) and sugars (fruit, sugar cane), the body's ability to absorb fat may also decrease. Therefore, even though a person who is overweight may appear to have plenty of energy and drive, there could also be underlying issues with his metabolism which could contribute to obesity. There is also evidence that the stress placed on the immune system, and the stress itself, can actually slow down the rate at which the body builds up antibodies against bacteria and viruses. Finally, studies suggest that people who are obese also tend to produce excess amounts of white blood cells, resulting in higher levels of cytokines, and thus increase the chances of developing chronic illnesses such as cancer.

It's meant to encourage you to get into the habit of stretching every day.

Question: what does it feel like after you have done some yoga? Answer: The sensations you experience may vary based on how much you have stretched and how well you did at keeping yourself loose. As usual, do whatever feels good!

Question: How often should I practice yoga? Answer: Yoga is best practiced twice a week. Some people find that they need less exercise than this so they can do it three times a week instead. But most people feel comfortable working their way through all the poses in this sequence at least once. So take advantage of it and don't miss it!

Question: What kind of stretches are recommended by various teachers/practitioners? Answer: They vary from person to person. You might hear something like ""don't overdo it"" or ""take it easy"". These statements would apply very differently if someone told you you had to perform a hundred push ups before sitting down for a whole hour (or something similar) while other people say ""I don't mind when you have your hands in the air for a minute or two."" It depends on your experience level; if you enjoy yoga and like to stretch it regularly, chances are you will be able to figure out your own body language and tell where everyone else is trying too hard or making mistakes. On the other hand, if you prefer to keep things simple and stick to one thing each time, and can manage to complete all the steps within twenty minutes without any effort, then there may still be room for improvement. Try different stretches first in order to see which ones feel good and which ones don't. Try them until they become second nature to you. When you feel comfortable with it, try another.

If you think you have the stage of primary, secondary or both of lung cancer, then you need to be careful. You may not get a diagnosis if your overall survival is 50-70% from stage 4 to stage 5. If your overall survival at stage 4 is greater than 70%, then it's unlikely that you are going to die of lung cancer. In general though, most people will survive their first few months after they've been diagnosed, but there is a very small proportion of people who do not make it through this period. The reason for this is because if you're in your 30s, 40s or 50s, chances are quite high that you'll actually have some residual cancer left by the time you reach 60 years old. As well as being able to tell how you did during this period, you can also know the stage of your disease. This gives you an idea of what type of chemotherapy is likely to work best for you. There's nothing wrong with having extra information like this as long as it doesn't mean that you can't take action.

Don't wait! Now that you're aware of your condition, it's important that you start taking steps now to ensure that you don't suffer any longer. For example, you might consider getting regular checks over the next two weeks so that you can be sure that all your symptoms are gone. If your condition is progressing more quickly than expected, it could cause problems with your ability to care for yourself, or even lead to complications which could put you out of action. It's also worth checking with your family doctor to see whether he or she has noticed anything unusual about your symptoms before.

A couple more points...

The people who have had the best success with low carbohydrate diets include those doing it because they are obese (as opposed to having health issues due to diabetes) and/or have other medical conditions like heart disease, high blood pressure or cancer. There is no specific diet recommended for every single individual, so you need to do your research and figure out what works best for you. Many of the foods that people suggest as low-carb are actually quite ""moderate"" in carbohydrate content. They are usually not very hard on the body and may even help with weight loss. For example, whole grains contain fiber which helps absorb excess calories and prevent cravings for sweets. The same is true with fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans and legumes.

For many years, Dr. Michael Eades' Low Carb Diets work was considered by many to be the gold standard of healthy eating by the public and by doctors. In my opinion, his diet is an excellent starting point - especially if you've already been overweight or obese. But it's very expensive and does come with a lot of restrictions. So there is certainly something to be said about using common sense when shopping around. Remember that you will likely get better results if you follow a lower carb diet first. If you are still concerned about your health and want to make sure you stay within the guidelines of a health care provider, talk to a nutritionist who specializes in the area you are working with.

In addition, you also need to consider the cost of the food itself. It can be a bit confusing because low-carb recipes often call for ingredients such as butter, egg whites, cream cheese, sour cream, oil, etc. While these items are part of the traditional high carbohydrate diet, they were added to our diets for reasons unrelated to helping us lose weight. Some of these items might even increase the amount of fat you consume. These items should not be eaten on their own, but rather combined with a nutritious low-fat meal. A protein supplement such as whey proteins or eggs can go along with a good fat source - such as coconut milk or avocado oil - which has the proper ratio of calories to carbohydrates.

It may be done by using either a single session, with an experienced therapist or group; or more frequently, by using several sessions for different problems and situations, often over a period of weeks or months. The aim of therapy is not merely to help people become better in some way, but rather to enable them to solve their problems effectively on their own and work through the problems themselves. A psychiatrist may also use psychotherapy to identify causes and factors which might have contributed to a particular experience. This can include examining a person's past experiences, feelings, attitudes and beliefs about their life and relationships (such as why they are feeling this way), and considering their thoughts and feelings about what has happened to them so far and how it will affect the future. The primary focus of psychotherapy is to provide the individual with tools, information, skills and techniques to facilitate personal growth and self-awareness.

There are many types of therapy:

Psychological (psychodynamic) therapy : based on a theory that holds mental states and emotional reactions are caused and influenced by underlying physiological processes. Psychotherapists use both cognitive and affective approaches to attempt to understand how we come to respond emotionally and psychologically to various situations and challenges. They seek to develop a client's ability to think clearly, reflect on his/her behaviour, learn to manage feelings appropriately, cope in stressful circumstances and improve communication and relationship quality.

Behavioural (behavioural) therapy: Based on theories about how emotions function and interact with our minds, behaviours and environments, behavioural therapists try to find ways of helping clients deal successfully with negative and challenging events, and establish positive routines and changes. They try to teach clients new strategies, ideas and techniques, such as changing habits, learning to communicate effectively, working independently, adjusting to change, and developing a sense of control. Some psychologists consider themselves primarily concerned with improving clients' abilities to understand and interpret stressors, while others are more interested in understanding how to reduce these.

How does diabetes affect my life?

Diabetes affects people differently. People with diabetes are often frail, confined to bed, often depressed and sometimes even suicidal. Some individuals manage their condition by taking insulin injections daily and eating food normally. Others need special diets to control their weight. Those who are severely obese may require a wheelchair to get around.

Can I lose my diabetes?

There may be some people with type 2 Diabetes who do not lose it completely. However, most Type 2 Diabetics have lost it at least somewhat and many don't regain it. This means that if you want to prevent developing Type 2 Diabetes, it's very important to follow all recommended precautions and diet to make sure that you do not develop this disease again.

Some people with type 2 Diabetes are also referred as ""insulin resistant"". Insulin resistance is caused by abnormal production of the hormone insulin (which controls blood sugar levels). If this happens, there is no way for your body to turn down the amount of glucose (sugar) that enters your bloodstream without causing trouble.

People with type 2 diabetes are also susceptible to certain infections such as hepatitis C and HIV. Therefore, it's essential that they practise regular exercise and avoid these diseases if possible. You should also see your GP regularly to check if you're having any illnesses that might indicate your diabetes is worsening.

What medications do diabetes patients use?

While there are many different types of medicines available which treat diabetes, they all work by inhibiting the action of sugar. In order for your body to get rid of excess sugar, you must take medication regularly (usually once a day). The following are some examples of medicine that help to regulate blood sugar levels, including those used to treat Type 1 Diabetes:

Antibiotics: Antibiotics are antibiotics used to kill bacteria. They cause problems for some people when taken too frequently. When they come into contact with certain drugs made by bacteria, there could be an allergic reaction (as with some antihistamines or allergy medications) which can lead to an illness called hyperglycaemia.

Some people get a little red mark on their cheeks when they have a cold, but most will never notice anything if it's only there for a few days. The same goes for the throat. Some people just feel sore or tender after coughing. It's perfectly normal and fine. There may also be some inflammation and redness, especially if you've had a cold before.

Other Questions

Q1: what if I want to delay or stop my regular monthly cycle?

A1: There are no studies showing that this affects your risk of breast cancer. However, there have been studies on whether stopping a woman's cycle early can lead to uterine fibroids. In one study, women with a history of irregular bleeding were six times more likely to develop uterine fibroid tumors than women whose cycles started at normal (non-menstrual) times. This study was conducted in Japan and China, where ovulation usually happens in the late afternoon, between 3:30 and 6 p.m., as opposed to the usual midmorning or evening time for most women. It seems that hormonal changes during pregnancy are linked to the development of ovarian fibroids because these changes occur in women with a high frequency of menstruation. There are also several studies linking hormone levels to the risk of developing uterine fibroids. The effects of hormone replacement therapy on the risk of developing uterine fibroids was studied in two trials, which showed that women receiving hormones had lower rates of uterine fibroids compared with women not receiving hormones. Women who started their periods after age 25 were eight times less likely to get uterine fibroids than those starting before age 25. These findings are consistent with other evidence suggesting that menstrual cycles can increase uterine weight. Researchers theorize that estrogen can cause blood vessels to expand, leading to higher uterine weights, and they believe that long-term use of hormonal contraception will reduce the risk of uterine fibroids. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not regulate hormonal contraceptives. In addition, although the FDA does review the labeling on hormonal contraceptive products, there is currently no regulation of labeling for hormonal contraceptive preparations containing progestins or estrogens. Some experts think that the FDA needs to establish standards regarding how labels should describe potential side effects from medications and treatments used during the first trimester of pregnancy. There is a recent case study about a woman with severe acne who developed ovarian cysts after using an intrauterine device. Although there was no known cause for her condition, she was prescribed a nonhormonal treatment regimen, including topical medications, which caused her uterus to swell significantly.

Some examples include peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, dairy products, etc. In some cases, sensitization can lead to anaphylactic shock and death.

5. SENSITIZATION TO SPECIES OF MUSHROOMS HAS BEEN PROVEN IN THE U.K. AND OTHER COUNTRIES BY THE UK ANIMAL SERVICE. They have had several incidents where rabbits were killed for eating one type of mushroom.

6. The term sensitized can also refer to an allergic reaction to any chemical. There may be instances of sensitivity to some chemicals, but this doesn't mean those chemicals cause allergic reactions.

Answer: yes, if you have this problem it is more likely that you will be getting a cold than anything else. The most common symptom is chills which usually goes away within 24 hours or so after you get out of bed. This isn't very dangerous because it only happens when you sit on cold surfaces such as cold hard floors and chairs. It's probably just a sign that the virus has been in your body for some time (like a cold sore). If you haven't had any other symptoms of the flu lately then you should consider yourself lucky. If you did get sick before the flu, you may want to try a milder version of the flu vaccine, one that doesn't contain the influenza virus (the FluMist), which you can order at http://www.fluisafe.org.uk/. As for the nausea, this might come from something called gastroenteritis - basically, inflammation of the gut caused by the digestive juices, but also it could be from vomiting as well. Another possibility is that your immune system has developed antibodies against a certain protein in the food that causes nausea and vomiting.

gpt2-large_83,"If you are using MS medications, it is most likely your first symptoms were due to an autoimmune reaction in the body. The immune system attacks and destroys myelin sheath around nerve cells called axons. This leads to numbness, tingling, weakness, pain or stiffness. These symptoms usually subside when you stop taking the drug.\nBut if your brain has been damaged (radiation therapy), the damage can be permanent. Your brain will never fully heal after radiation. It may go into a state that can cause new diseases or problems such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and/or Lou Gehrig's disease. So it is important for patients with multiple sclerosis to see their neurologist every 3 months to make sure they are still receiving all appropriate treatment.

Q: What symptoms do I have to look out for at the office?

A: There are many signs and symptoms that may indicate a neurological problem. Most people who come to our office for MS symptom checkups are very surprised when we tell them about other physical signs and symptoms associated with MS that occur naturally in the body including: headaches; fatigue; nausea; vomiting; dizziness; sensitivity to light; muscle aches and pains; memory loss; depression; vision changes; joint pain; skin rashes; weight gain; and more. And many times these same symptoms are only detected during a routine visit to the office. We recommend that patients do a thorough examination at home before getting a visit from us because so often MS symptoms don't seem to emerge until later. For example, some women with MS develop chronic morning sickness that goes away on its own but others become ill with morning sickness once they start working full time. Often MS is not noticed until late in life when there are obvious symptoms such as tiredness, lack of energy, headaches, neck and back pain, mood swings and mood disorders. Symptoms like this happen frequently and need no special explanation. When you have symptoms that seem common in MS we want to investigate further to find the root causes. Our MS specialist will help you determine which type of symptoms are due to the primary cause: inflammation, neurodegeneration or a combination of both. In addition, if you have any of these secondary conditions then your doctor may refer you to a neurologist. But in cases where both conditions are present, our specialists may refer you to a neurologist for an extensive evaluation of both main causes and secondary effects. Sometimes patients with MS have trouble recalling certain events or remember things incorrectly for years.

Other forms of employment may also permit you to work. For example, some college courses are available in MS. In other words, the government allows people with MS to work. The Department of Labor has published regulations on this, including rules for working while using a wheelchair. However, there are many limitations that apply. For instance, even if your employer does allow you to use a wheelchair, the cost of doing so will depend upon the size of the company. It is important to remember that if you lose your job because of your disability, it may become very difficult to find another one again if you want to continue to pursue your education and training.

Can I take out student loans to pay for my medical expenses?\nThe federal government requires all borrowers who borrow money from the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) to obtain insurance coverage through their jobs, including those at nursing homes and assisted living facilities. This means that if you are a senior citizen, you could potentially face significant student loan repayment costs over time. Some states allow students to qualify for a waiver based on income levels that would not require them to qualify for FFELLP insurance if they were to become unemployed. If you receive financial aid assistance, consider carefully whether your current job covers your health care needs (see below).

What about the law that says that all children should have access to public schools?\nThere is no federal policy requiring school districts to provide services in MS. But when it comes to education, school districts often offer programs that meet certain criteria for funding. These programs typically include physical therapy or speech therapy, tutoring, ESL lessons, arts and music instruction, or special education services. These programs usually come with high fees and/or strict requirements. Therefore, if you plan to enroll in these types of programs in your community, ensure that your local school district provides these services.

If I don't want to enroll in any of these educational programs, how can I attend class?Some universities offer additional activities such as art classes, clubs, musical performances, etc., and your school district might give you some help in determining which of these options are most suitable for you. However, it is likely that these extra benefits are more expensive than attending a traditional school.

gpt2-large_77,"Although the onset of MS is thought to be similar, women who have MS may also experience symptoms related to menstruation and/or PMS. This is because they may also have periods or have hormonal changes that can affect their menstrual cycles. Menstrual symptomology in MS is typically milder than in other forms of MS, but it does occur frequently, with some reports indicating up to 50% prevalence.[11]

PMS (period-related neuropathy) occurs when nerve cells in the legs are damaged or die due to a lack of blood flow. Symptoms usually appear within days to weeks after the initial injury, with varying degrees of severity depending on the type of pain involved. These include pain associated with muscle spasms, loss of sensation in certain muscles, numbness in others and painful swelling. Patients often report feeling tired during these early stages of PMS, and many complain of increased difficulty walking and balance, decreased mobility and mental functioning.

The most common symptom of PMS is tenderness and redness of the face, neck or back. It is more prevalent in women than in men, especially in younger women. The majority of people experiencing PMS will not seek medical attention for it; however, those suffering from PMS should consult a health care provider if their symptoms worsen.[12]

If you've ever had period symptoms but feel there's been no proper diagnosis, don't despair! There are several simple tests you can take to confirm that your period is normal, including a urine test called hysteroscopy—which allows doctors to measure the pH level of urine—and an endometrial biopsy, which allows them to detect abnormalities such as tumors, fibroids, cysts, or inflammatory lesions. If both these techniques show abnormality, your doctor may suggest treating the disease using medication and surgery instead.",77,How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?,-0.3583772480487823,2,question,8,0.008264462809917356,292,12
gpt2-large_1,"Chronic disease is one of the most serious threats to our health. The World Health Organization has defined it as the ""chronic, high-level inflammatory disorder of the immune system that produces a wide range of harmful symptoms"" (WHO). It includes such conditions as type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), Crohn's Disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, hepatitis C, asthma, lupus, and cancers. According to Dr. Kripalani, diseases like cancer, heart disease, depression, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other forms of neurodegenerative disorders also contribute to chronic diseases. In fact, more than 30% of all deaths worldwide are attributable to chronic diseases. \r

A major cause of death in developed countries is cardiovascular disease, which can be divided into two main categories: ischemic and non-ischemic. Ischemic heart disease is caused by atherosclerosis and is the leading cause of death globally. Non-ischemic causes include coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, lung cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, and colon cancer. Cancer is one of the top 10 causes of death in developing countries. About 10 million people die annually from cancer worldwide - 2.5 times the number who die from HIV/AIDS. As you may know, AIDS is an opportunistic infection, meaning that the virus can infect healthy individuals and cause them to become infected with HIV or develop AIDS in spite of having no infectious agent. People often think that AIDS does not exist because there are not enough cases reported but this simply isn't true. There are millions of people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide but only about 1000 cases of AIDS are ever discovered each year due to the difficulty and expense involved in testing for HIV. Also, AIDS remains unknown among those who have had positive tests because they have not been tested enough. That means that only 60% of all people diagnosed with HIV are actually infected. A good way to understand how many thousands of people may be suffering from AIDS is to consider the population of France. If you take the total number of French people aged 18 years and older and divide it by the population of France you get 0.03%. However, if you multiply the percentage by the number of new infections each year (approximately 300,000 per year) you get approximately 6,500 people who are affected. Another way to better understand the magnitude of AIDS is to compare it with tuberculosis, another contagious disease. Approximately 4 million people suffer from tuberculosis",1,What are the most common chronic diseases?

However if there are sharp teeth inside the device and you are using these teeth on a daily basis, then it might be wise to remove the appliances after only 3-5 uses just to be safe.

This is what I am dealing with now. How can I help you more?

ANSWER: You should first seek professional help for yourself before seeking medical attention for your symptoms. See my article entitled ""Cognitive Behavioral Therapy For Multiple Sclerosis"" for tips on how to obtain the best results from CBT. My personal experience has taught me that when a person feels they have nothing more they can do to improve their situation, they usually stop taking action. Often times this is a sign of depression or suicidal thoughts.

Answers to other commonly asked questions:

Q: What if I don't like the way my MS looks? Is there anything I could change?

A: Yes. It would be nice if you felt comfortable wearing an outfit that doesn't show too much skin, and you'd look good doing so! That being said, many patients find themselves wishing they could go back to normal everyday life as soon as possible (i.e., dress like a student again). To remedy this problem you may wish to try wearing pants to school/work and wearing a T-shirt at home. If you're still uncomfortable, you might consider having your doctor make changes to your current regimen in hopes of improving your comfort level. Alternatively, you could take medication such as steroids or oral antibiotics to reduce swelling in the affected area. A quick Google search will turn up several articles which detail ways to decrease inflammation in MS.

Q: Why did I develop MS?

A: The exact cause of MS has yet to be determined, but there are a number of factors thought to play a part including genetics, age, environmental toxins, disease, and stress. The combination of all these factors causes varying degrees of severity, depending upon the individual. There is no single cure for MS. All therapies aim to manage the symptoms and promote recovery by removing any remaining triggers causing the problems.

gpt2-large_35,"The Ketogenic Diet is not the best choice for those suffering from Type 2 Diabetes, especially if you are diabetic. The Ketogenic Diet will make your blood sugar rise and give you an energy boost in the form of fat burning calories but it will also have negative side effects such as weight gain, insulin resistance, increased risk for heart disease and many more. It may be recommended by your doctor or a professional who has experience with Diabetes. However, it can help a person reduce their carbohydrate intake to some extent when they are on low carb diets. If you suffer from any other chronic condition that causes insulin resistance, then a lower carb diet might work better for you and may even cure your problem!

Q: How much protein should I consume during my ketogenic diet?

A: Your body needs about 20 grams per pound of lean muscle mass and 70 grams of total protein per day. For example, a 200 lb woman would need 3200-3000 grams of protein to maintain her healthy weight and healthy muscle mass. You can calculate these numbers on this website. Keep in mind, however, that this number does not take into account the amount of fats consumed (see below).

Protein sources include meat, poultry, seafood and nuts/seeds. Vegetables and fruits do not contribute to optimal health so a balanced diet needs to be supplemented with vegetables, fruit and milk products like yogurt. Eggs, cheese and eggs yolks are great sources of protein.

See the section above on how much carbs should I eat during my ketogenic diet. See also: What's the difference between carbohydrates and fats and why the distinction matters.


How much fat should I eat during my ketogenic diet?

Most people think of eating less fat because there's no room for excess calorie intake or ""bad"" fats such as saturated fat. But this isn't true. A good ratio of fat to carbs is 10:1 or higher (see the chart below). Also see our Fat Intake Chart which shows how much fat should be taken up by each food type.

Note that the recommendation for carb intake is based upon a 1500 kcal/day baseline and a person's daily activity level. A person at or above the normal metabolic rate can use 500 - 1000 extra calories per day.

Head pampering/brushing may cause more skin irritation than the underlying problem. When you brush your head, some bacteria get into the hair follicle and this causes more infections. In addition, you need to wash the scalp every day, which also helps protect it from bacteria. You should also try not to shampoo your head too often because it might irritate the scalp and make it itch. The best way to prevent this is to use mild soap with a lather. After brushing or after washing the scalp, put on clean cotton gloves and let the hands dry before putting on fresh gloves. If you feel like you have a lot of excess oil on your forehead, massage a small amount of coconut oil under your eyes for 3 minutes to release oil. Also massage the oil on your face and neck.

Q: I have had severe psoriasis for years, but now I am seeing results. What's going on? Answer: Psoriasis (Psoriatic Arthritis) is a chronic inflammatory disorder caused by a combination of factors such as genetics, age, lifestyle, stress and disease severity. The symptoms include scaly patches of skin that look like brownish-black spots with red edges around them. These areas usually occur at night time and last throughout the day. They vary in color from dark brown to light yellow to deep purple. Psoriasis affects both men and women. Psoriasis is typically treated through medication and is reversible if treatment is started within two weeks of onset. However, psoriasis does require periodic visits to a doctor who specializes in psoriasis.


If you do not have psoriasis, then psoriasis is not a serious health concern, as long as you keep up the prescribed medications. Psoriasis treatments typically include topical creams, ointments, injections and surgical procedures. Some people choose to go without surgery altogether. See our Treatment Guide for details.

Q: What should I do if my mother is experiencing early MS symptoms after she has had three children?

A: You need to see your doctor immediately. Your mom might be suffering from a neurological problem that has yet to be diagnosed because she hasn't been tested for MS or other diseases that could trigger her symptoms. There's nothing wrong with her health, but the first step in addressing these issues is to ask for help.

For example, if your mother has been taking a high dose of corticosteroids (which can cause muscle pain), then she has an increased risk of developing late-onset MS symptoms after pregnancy. She needs to stop all medications before delivery. Other things you can try include getting regular checkups as soon as possible so your doctor knows what's happening and why you're not responding as well to treatment.

Q: Should I get blood tests for my daughter when she's younger than 5 years old?

A: Not unless you know the test results are normal. The risks associated with older blood tests can be dangerous for young people who don't understand their consequences, such as the increased chance of heart disease and stroke. To protect yourself and your child, talk to your pediatrician about any concerns related to blood testing.

Q: How does one avoid contracting HIV while being infected by another person?

A: Do your best to keep your sexual partners healthy. It's important to stay sexually active in order to maintain a low viral load. A viral load level between 100 and 150 copies per milliliter (cpml) indicates no infections were detected and therefore there was no exposure to HIV. That means that no transmission occurred; however, infection with HIV is still considered HIV-infection even though it didn't result in any physical damage or impairment. Keep in mind that being infected with HIV is not the same as contracting it through sex. This may sound confusing because HIV and AIDS share similar terms, but both relate to a condition where someone becomes sick from a virus. So, knowing which kind of HIV is most likely to affect you is helpful because it helps you decide whether or not you want to continue engaging in sexual activity that exposes you to this potentially life threatening virus.

gpt2-large_59,"not yet, but it's a possibility. It could lead to some kind of damage or dysfunction in certain brain areas and it may be possible that you have a genetic predisposition to MS.

Q: if it is true, what other options are there?

A: You have two options to address this issue. One option would be treatment with an antibody called interferon beta1a (IFN-beta1a), which blocks the inflammatory response caused by the disease. Another option would be to go under general anesthesia for several days. Anesthesiology is one of the most well-studied medical procedures, so I think the evidence behind this is pretty strong. However, it does require a great deal of commitment from your doctor, because once they know that you're going into surgery, that's when their attention shifts to the next patient. They might feel pressured at all times to get you out on time or to give the procedure just enough time to pass. So the only way I can see this being feasible in the near future is if you'd get the operation within 6 months after diagnosis. If you were able to go into an operating room within 3 weeks of diagnosis then you wouldn't have to worry about the anesthesia or being rushed through.

I don't see any downside to having to go under general anesthesia. You really shouldn't be going into surgery unless there's a serious reason, like if you've had your appendix removed or something else.",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-9.48516845703125,65,question,8,0.31862745098039214,244,0
gpt2-large_54,"The patient's physician will use a medical history, physical examination and laboratory results to determine if the disease is MS. If the doctor suspects the person has MS, they may order an MRI or other tests.

After determining that the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis exists, a specialist in neurology performs a spinal tap for imaging purposes. This test, which looks at brain fluid (spinal fluid) levels, tells doctors more about what's going on inside the person's head than how the disease affects their muscles. However, it doesn't tell them anything about whether the disease might affect the rest of their body. For example, there could be damage to nerves or blood vessels, such as bleeding from a ruptured spleen, and inflammation of the brain (encephalopathy).

Multiple sclerosis can cause symptoms such as headache, fatigue, weakness and numbness in one leg. A nerve injury caused by a stroke could also contribute to muscle pain, weakness and stiffness. Severe depression can make the condition worse. And people with MS who have had recent accidents or injuries might feel fatigued or depressed when they're resting, even though they're doing fine.

If you think you have MS, talk to your doctor right away. He or she can get an evaluation of your symptoms so he or she knows which treatment options are best for you.

gpt2-large_51,"You might think that there are two definitions of holistic medicine. The first definition is the one used by the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians, which includes ""a system of complementary therapies based on a multidisciplinary approach to healing."" \nThe other definition would be the one used by the International Society for Integrative Medicine (ISIM), which includes ""integrating all aspects of health into a therapeutic model that has been proven effective in promoting positive effects in patients with various disease states."" In other words, an integrative doctor may practice both types of medicine simultaneously. \nAccording to ISIM, there are many different kinds of holistic medicine, but they generally tend to focus on four basic components: \n1. Healing through the body's natural systems.\n2. Healing through our emotional and psychological systems.\n3. Healing through our spiritual or religious systems.\n4. And finally, healing through consciousness. \nWhat is your take on this? Can you share some of your thoughts about this matter? I've read several articles over the past few years discussing the difference between traditional and alternative approaches to holistic healthcare. For example, Dr. Sohrab Nafisi wrote an excellent article entitled ""Is There A Difference Between Traditional and Alternative Health Care?"" In my opinion, they don't make much sense from an unbiased perspective because everyone can benefit from each kind of care. So far, I haven't come across any scientific studies proving that there isn't a clear distinction between these different ways to heal, but perhaps there will someday. It could just as well be that there are no differences at all. One thing is for certain though; people are constantly searching for the ""right"" medicine and if we ignore all science-based facts like evolution or nature itself, then the whole medical field becomes irrelevant. But that doesn't mean we should reject science altogether! People are often swayed by sensational stories and unfounded claims made without any evidence whatsoever, but if you're looking for something real, look up actual research done by scientists. If you're still skeptical, consider that even some mainstream doctors accept the concept of humanism - or, rather, its opposite: agnosticism. I'll leave it up to you to decide which one makes more sense, but my advice would be to stick with the idea that we shouldn't believe everything we read or hear.

If you want to see if your partner exhibits the same symptoms, you can ask him or her about them during sex.

Step 2: How do I know he or she has it?

Ask yourself three questions to determine whether your partner has Borderline Personality Disorder:

Does he or she exhibit any of these behaviors when there's not enough time between sexual encounters for intimacy (e.g., ""I'm too busy""), but you still want to have sex? Does he or she complain about feeling empty? Has he or she been the victim of abuse by one person?

Is he or she depressed? If so, what causes it? Is he or she unable to express his or her feelings effectively? Is he or she easily upset? What is his or her pattern of anger or frustration? Are his or her relationships with others good or bad, stable or unpredictable?

Are you concerned about the quality of your own life? You might be worried that this guy or girl may harm himself or herself. He or she doesn't seem happy at home and at school. Do you feel powerless over the issue? Or did your partner give up on life long ago?

Do you worry about how he or she will take care of themselves when they get old? They don't like their current diet, exercise routine, or other changes, which may put them at risk for heart disease or diabetes. Can you tell if this man or girl has high blood pressure? Will they need medication or go under the knife when they reach middle age? And would you like to avoid a situation where the doctor asks you what kind of treatment you're going to recommend?

gpt2-large_85,"Yes, that is a very common syndrome. It is called'multiple sclerosis re-entrant' or MSR or MSR for short. As the disease progresses, it begins to cause symptoms that are similar in intensity to those of relapses. Symptoms include weakness, pain and stiffness in one arm or leg; fatigue and muscle aches; depression; memory loss; problems with vision, hearing, balance and swallowing; and many other conditions. The severity of these symptoms may also vary from person to person. In general, MSR is often caused by an autoimmune process which involves the immune system attacking the myelin sheath covering nerve fibers (nerve fibres) that surround nerves. MSR can be seen as a progression of relapses resulting in chronic pain and difficulty with movement.

Q: What causes MSR?

A: There are many different theories about why people develop this condition. Many scientists believe there has been a genetic mutation that leads to MSR and most researchers agree that the disease starts when the gene responsible for producing white blood cells - MTHFR - ceases to function properly. If someone with MSR inherits two copies of this faulty gene and one normal copy, they will have no risk of having their own child to pass on this inherited trait. However, if both parents have two mutated copies, then the chance of passing down this mutation increases. People who inherit at least one mutant allele should not have children, as they may suffer lifelong health consequences. Some research suggests there may be environmental factors that contribute to MSR. For example, it was suggested that some people with MSR may experience a certain chemical reaction during pregnancy that might damage the baby's developing brain. This could increase the risk of birth defects.

The symptoms of MSR appear to begin in early childhood and are thought to involve an overactive immune response, which is known as autoimmunity or auto-inflammatory disease. Autoimmune disease occurs when your body produces too much anti-receptors (antibodies) against a particular type of antigen – proteins produced by your body when you eat foods like peanuts, eggs, dairy products or soybeans. The antibodies you produce in response to these food substances attack and destroy the tissue lining your lungs (eosinophils). These cells line up along the walls of the airways and help remove bacteria and debris. You get tired easily, you feel weak and dizzy. Your breathing becomes shallow and it takes longer to breathe deeply. Often you cough frequently, even after coughing",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-2.740074396133423,94,question,8,0.47715736040609136,409,1
gpt2-large_123,"I've had this problem for about 2 years now and have tried everything to get it under control. I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis in May of 2014, and the thyroid hormone test result came back negative on July 5th of that year (I'm 32). Since then, my blood work has come back negative as well, so I know they can't be thyroid related.

After a few more tests, it became apparent I still had elevated levels of TSH/TSH; which are usually normal for someone with a healthy thyroid gland. My doctor ordered some blood tests to see if there was something else going on. They found high levels of C-reactive protein, a biomarker for inflammation, which is extremely common when you have a chronic disease like Hashimoto's or autoimmune thyroiditis, so these were all positive. The only surprise in the whole thing is the low thyroxine level – because that should go up with age! He also discovered a history of unexplained fatigue from being too weak to exercise regularly (the usual culprit here) and his wife's constant complaining about her loss of energy and the same symptoms. He gave me an anti-thyroid medication and told me not to worry about it, since he knows I'm just doing what nature intended. However, I got pretty concerned after reading the results of my initial blood test, and started looking into other possible causes. As most people do, I read up on the internet, searched medical journals, talked to friends, etc. I found lots of articles saying this condition isn't real, that everyone who has it has been eating way too many animal products, that certain herbs help, etc. After a while, I decided I'd had enough and wanted to take matters into my own hands by trying to figure out why. There were many different things that could be causing me to experience these symptoms, but none of them seemed to fit together nicely. When we tested both my husband and myself, our bodies told us we each had slightly higher than normal C-Reactivity values; and our TSH levels weren't quite where they normally would be without being hyperthyroid. We discussed this with my mom, who suggested I look at a few studies on this topic. She recommended taking a small amount of supplements that might make a difference, so I did. One of those supplements is called DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), which actually helps our body convert omega-3 fats into their longer chain form.

gpt2-large_95,"The following is a complete listing of all known solutions for this problem.

Solution:

There are six possible ways to solve the problem, but only three are correct:

Using an array as the solution (which creates a new array). This produces the same results but with much fewer memory allocations. Using an array and a pointer to it. Which will use twice as many allocs as using an array directly. That means that if your program uses pointers you must allocate them before every operation. Doing nothing. Which will create as many allocs as the first two options, even more than that when doing nothing.

As far as I know there are no other answers for this question.

The answer is obviously that everything should be done with arrays!

This may seem like cheating, but it's not. When we write code we often have to think about how something works in isolation from its context (whether it's a function or data structure) so we can make better decisions about what elements should be allocated based on their particular needs. We're making choices because we want to do things properly; if they were independent and left us free to choose without regard to context, we'd just put everything together and get rid of things as soon as we saw fit.

Many experts believe that a healthy diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables is important because it can help prevent certain illnesses including heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer, Alzheimer's and arthritis. But not everyone has access to quality, whole foods. Research suggests that poor diets may increase the risk for several diseases, including Type II Diabetes and obesity. It may also be worth considering whether specific dietary patterns should be used to reduce your risk of these conditions.

gpt2-large_86,"The primary progressive disease is a progressive loss of muscle mass. There are various degrees, and it can be severe enough that the patient will lose all function in the limbs, including walking and breathing, as well as their ability to use their hands or arms. This is the most common form of MS.

Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS) is when there are no signs of progressive atrophy in the muscles of the trunk or legs, but symptoms still exist. It can be diagnosed by an MRI scan, or if a person has one of several other imaging tests. People who have PPS often report fatigue, pain, weakness, and abnormal movement. Many doctors suspect PPS because they do not see any changes in brain functions like memory, thinking, speech, or coordination. Many people experience problems with swallowing, vision, hearing, balance, etc., which may also indicate PPS. Although many people with PPS remain in denial about what's wrong with them, at some point they realize that their condition is slowly killing them. Patients must learn how to live independently again; many make a living from assisting others with disabilities such as walking, cooking, cleaning, nursing, etc.; however, some only survive for up to 3 years after diagnosis, although some recover completely.

Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS) occurs after one of these two types of MS develops. It is characterized by significant muscle atrophy, but does not always show the same features of PPS. Symptoms may include joint stiffness, spasticity, weakness, numbness, tingling, cramps, or paralysis. These symptoms usually occur within 6 months of the onset of the first sign of disease. Rarely, SPMS may cause neurological deficits like difficulty speaking or walking. Patients commonly report feeling tired all day long and sleep problems, and sometimes even depression or suicidal thoughts. Some people develop severe physical limitations, while others require extensive support. Most patients go on to find another career, but those who need help often choose medical assistance due to stigma attached to this type of disability.

Treatment options for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis include medications, surgery, therapies to strengthen joints, and psychological treatments. Depending on the severity of the injury, treatment typically takes between 2-4 weeks to complete. However, a person may benefit greatly from immediate therapy before being placed on medication, since more than 80% of patients die within the first year.

Your doctor may recommend that you do not use a sleep aid for the duration of your MS. However, if you are able to tolerate it and feel good enough to perform your normal daily tasks, consider using one or more effective treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).\r

For example, CBT has been shown to reduce symptoms of insomnia. You can find a list of recommended therapies at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/.

In addition to failing to conduct actual research into vaccines or vaccines in general, the antivaccination movement also does a poor job of communicating their position on vaccines. For example, they have spent more than $20 million trying to discredit the MMR vaccination because of claims that it causes autism, even though there is no evidence to support this claim and even if it were true, there would be absolutely nothing wrong with having the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccine administered to children at ages 7 months through 12 years to prevent diseases such as chickenpox (chicken pox). This approach is very common among antivaccinationists and is known as ""cherry picking,"" which means going after one group of cases and ignoring other groups or issues due to political or financial reasons.\r


Another way to look at what happens when you stop vaccinating your child is by comparing those who do not get vaccinated to those who do. In 2015, there were approximately 616,000 unvaccinated Americans aged 13 years or older and about 11 percent of them had been previously diagnosed with some form of childhood illness. These illnesses include allergic rhinitis, eczema, asthma, and hay fever.\r


Of these children, nearly 80 percent had never received a single dose of vaccine, the CDC reports. \r


There is good news! While the number of unvaccinated children has increased slightly since 2014 (from 518,800 to 531,500) there are still millions of kids out there who will benefit from a healthy dose of vaccinations -- especially given that the majority of vaccines don't work, according to the Mayo Clinic.

For more information, please see the following article : Sex and Multiple Sclerosis - A Review and Update on Current Research: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=sex+and+multiple-sclerosis

Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), gonorrhoea, human papillomavirus (HPV), genital warts, human chlamydia, HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis, trichomoniasis, and other STDs are much less common in sexually active men than in women. These conditions have been found to be associated with a reduced risk for several STDs (e.g., HPV infection). Although these findings do not necessarily imply that all infections caused by bacteria or viruses are equally important causes of STDs, it does suggest that certain bacterial or viral species are more likely to cause disease than others. For example, HSV-2 is thought to increase the risk of acquisition of some types of anal and oral cancers by about 10-15% (Aguilar et al., 2002; Mireles et al., 1999; O'Rourke, 1999). However, this conclusion can only be made based on epidemiologic data. It should also be kept in mind that there is a considerable amount of debate regarding the association between HSV-1 and other STIs. While HSV-1 has been shown to increase the risk of cervical cancer, its relationship to infection with genital herpes is still controversial. This is especially true when considering the fact that genital ulcerative lesions are commonly mistaken for genital warts. Thus, the best available evidence indicates that the benefits of routine screening for HSV-2 may vary depending upon whether you consider genital ulcers to be genital warts (i.e., ""hysterical"" lesions that appear on an individual's genitals), or genital warts that represent genital inflammation (i.e., ""noninflammatory"" lesions that don't affect external genitalia).

Another condition associated with decreased risk for many STDs involves sexual intercourse during pregnancy, which may have implications for both health and pregnancy outcomes. As discussed above, most studies show that exposure to HIV or syphilis increases the risk of miscarriage. According to one study, when a woman was infected with both HIV and syphilis simultaneously she had a 30% higher probability of having a miscarriage (O'R",58,Risk to develop multiple sclerosis,-3.820047616958618,29,question,8,0.12554112554112554,352,16

""There are many different types of shoulder poses. For example, you could do the traditional shoulder stretch with your back straight, or you can do a frontward bend to strengthen and lengthen your shoulders."" -Dr. John F. Coyle, MD

This is an easy stretching exercise that can help get your back in shape while improving your posture (or even relieve some aches!). You'll need to do it at least 3-4 times each week for about 6 weeks. If it's not working for you, try doing a few of these exercises on one arm, and then switch arms. Do this every day until you feel like your back is completely healthy again. As long as you're getting regular work done and you don't stop, we know that your back will look amazing!

The Back Stretch Workout

For those who would prefer to keep things simple, Dr. J. F. Coyle offers you a free online workout program which does exactly what it says, only better. The benefits of this program include:

Easy to follow instructions that require little technical expertise

Exercises designed to strengthen the entire body

A variety of exercises designed specifically for back health

Great results without any equipment needed, so you can try the exercises out whenever you want

No special diets required

You can find this great program by visiting his website: www.jfcoely.com/backstretch.htm.

Another common question people have about the back stretch works is whether there is anything special you should be doing before starting this routine? Well, when I started practicing yoga 2 years ago, I couldn't find a single ""back stretch"" video on Youtube, so I decided to create my own. After watching many videos, I discovered that this was actually pretty much all there was – no fancy postures or gimmicks here. My goal was simply to focus on how to get the most benefit from the basic pose, without trying too hard to make it seem more advanced than it really is.

So that's why my version of the back stretch works best if you just stick to performing it correctly. Remember, once you've mastered the exercise properly, you can try other variations such as pushing your shoulders forward, bending your knees, raising your head and elbows towards your chest, etc., but remember that it's very important that you stay true to the original movement patterns.

In a retrospective cohort study, the authors reported that the risk of survival in patients with stage I (low-grade) and II (moderate-to-high grade) metastases was significantly higher for those who were prescribed high doses of alkylating agents than those given lower doses.

Surgical Intervention

Stage IV lung cancer is often referred to as ""surgically aggressive"" or ""invasive."" The term ""aggressive"" implies that it is more invasive than stage I, II, or III. In fact, all three types of lung cancers have been classified as nonmetastatic by the American Cancer Society, as are most other tumors. According to this classification scheme, advanced stages I, II, and III of malignant melanoma do not require surgical intervention and thus can be treated surgically without any harm to the patient.

According to the Mayo Clinic on the use of radiation therapy in cancer treatment:

The incidence rate of metastasis from these tumors is approximately 100/100 000 per year. … At present, there are no reliable estimates regarding the effectiveness of radiation therapy with regard to reducing the progression of metastatic disease; however, preliminary evidence suggests that radiation may reduce some but not all tumor growth rates. There has been much debate about the relative efficacy of different radiologic modalities for improving outcomes following surgery for advanced skin cancer (see Surgical Intervention), although at present no clinical data exist documenting an effect of specific modalities over others. However, because of their potential role in controlling metastatic disease, the benefits of such therapies should be considered before they are used to treat other forms of cancer.

If the goal of treatment is to slow tumor growth after removal of cancer cells, then low dose radiation therapy seems like an obvious choice. Low dose radiation therapy includes ionizing radiation therapy, i.e., gamma rays, x-rays, neutron activation, X ray machines, and magnetic resonance imaging. When used effectively by people with very old, small tumors, it is also called radiofrequency therapy.

The American Cancer Society recommends:

There is little doubt that the risks associated with low dose radiation therapy are low, yet its benefit appears to outweigh these risks. This conclusion has been confirmed by multiple studies, which suggest that low dose radiation therapy is safe when performed in accordance with the guidelines of the American College of Radiology.1 2 3

Please read the following information carefully before proceeding. Please also see our FAQ's for more info about this disorder.

What causes it?

The most common cause of heavy flare-ups is chronic, or relapsing, sinusitis that does not respond to medicine. The other cause of the pain can sometimes be an underlying infection in the ear canal (e.g., bacterial meningitis). Sometimes the problem appears as either a burning sensation on one side or the entire head of the nose (called ""the ""double-whammy"" condition) - especially when you have no cold symptoms. In these cases, if left untreated, there will be persistent inflammation until the infection disappears or the person regains normal function.

How are the flare ups diagnosed?

A medical history is important in determining the type and severity of sinus infections which are responsible for the excessive swelling associated with the double-whammy. A complete physical examination including an x-ray of the body and evaluation of the skin and mucous membranes should be done to determine the source and extent of the infection. If possible, you should find out who has been exposed to the infection(s) while wearing the device. You may need to visit the nearest emergency room or another health care facility. To help reduce complications from the condition, keep a log of all visits to any hospital, clinic or doctors office.

Do I have a hearing loss?

If you do not hear or feel pain while using the device, and/or if you believe you have a hearing loss, please let us know immediately. We recommend getting your hearing evaluated by a physician. For further assistance regarding hearing loss, call 1-888-934-2624.

The first is to eat mainly fruits, vegetables, whole grains (brown rice), legumes, nuts, seeds, etc. This means that you should avoid red meat, fish, cheese, eggs, butter, sugary foods, sugar-sweetened beverages, dairy products, animal fats, and other processed foods.

The second way is to consume more fruits, vegetables, whole grain, nuts, seeds, beans, and whole milk powder than the average person consumes in one year. This means that you need to consume about 200 grams less per day.

For example if your total caloric intake was 1000 calories per day then it would be better for you to have only 2200 calories in your body weight than 10 grams less in body weight. If you want to lose weight faster then you should aim for having 100 grams of fat per day.


How much weight can I lose?

Weight loss from 5% to 10% is possible depending on your calorie consumption. Weight loss from 10% to 20% requires 1.5 times as many calories.

To lose weight fast you should try to consume about 400 kilojoules per day or 200 kcal/kg of fat per day. Keep this constant throughout the day until you reach your goal weight. You could even use a scale while counting calories. In order to increase your metabolic rate by 20%, you must burn an additional 30 kJ/kg of fat per day!

gpt2-large_53,"Psychotherapy, more broadly defined, refers to the treatment of a range of mental disorders by means that focus on changing and integrating personal experiences into one's thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. It involves both cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy, which are approaches to working with patients in their everyday lives as well as within institutions and larger groups. Both CBT and IPT have been shown to be effective at treating anxiety and depression symptoms and stressors, while also being very useful for managing other life challenges such as relationship problems.

The American Psychiatric Association defines CBT as follows:

""Effective CBT employs an integrated approach to treatment based upon the principles and concepts of psychoanalysis, existential psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy, developmental theory, dialectical behavior therapy, therapeutic collaboration, and interpersonal psychotherapy.""\r

Psychoanalysis is considered an analytic philosophy of mind (i.e., an understanding of mental states), whereas existential psychology focuses on individual human experience. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy refers to psychological practices aimed at improving social functioning and self-esteem through various methods that involve applying rules and procedures derived from psychology or sociology. The concept of interpersonal psychotherapy has been developed to address social issues associated with relationships, including conflict resolution, interpersonal communication, dating relationships, intimacy, and relationship maintenance.

IPT seeks to improve people's relationships with each other and with others by focusing on individuals' perspectives and actions. It attempts to develop a sense of belonging within this group so that people can see themselves in meaningful ways and can feel good about who they are and where they come from. Intimate therapist/patient work has traditionally involved talking with clients, listening closely to how they describe and act out their emotional needs, and then helping them identify and deal with those needs. Interpersonal therapist work emphasizes discussing and resolving conflicts among patients. This may be done either face-to-face or via video conferencing systems, using a variety of techniques such as eye contact, eye gaze management, nonverbal cues, and gentle touch. Interpersonal therapists typically take on the role of ""protective parent,"" providing guidance and support to clients during times when it seems important to talk openly and constructively with their partner(s). Many aspects of this work will require ongoing training, but the basic premise remains the same: building client trust and competence in order to bring about real change.

She went through treatments that left her with disability, then eventually died from complications from this illness.

After all, why would you want to have your own private medical opinion done to you? This also means that if something like this ever happened in front of an audience at an event, I wouldn't be able to speak up on stage without having to worry about being called out by the crowd or worse yet, being harassed by the health care provider (not to mention how uncomfortable being seen with MS might make me feel).

I am a member of reddit's /r/MensRights board. I'm going to post here for two reasons: 1) I am afraid that I could lose my membership and thus my ability to participate with my fellow men, both on /r/mensrights and elsewhere; 2) As someone who has been involved in the movement since its inception, I am worried that the discourse regarding MRAs will become increasingly polarized, and that the discourse surrounding MRA activity may become even more polarized. While there has never been any official position taken by /r/MensRights, there seems to be a tendency towards taking positions that appear to validate the viewpoints of MRAs (including some that seem quite extreme), and which are difficult to reconcile with reality. The lack of focus on other perspectives within the community, particularly those of women, leads to a feeling of 'other'ness among the members of /r/MensRights that sometimes feels alienating, and makes it less likely that I can find allies amongst other men. In addition, some of the things that are said about us in /r/MensRights are simply unacceptable to me.

This may seem like a lot of money, but remember this is not enough for most women who are in need of treatment. The average family income in Texas can easily exceed $100,000/year.

The most important thing to know about cancer chemotherapy is that it does not cure any of your symptoms. If you experience side effects such as nausea or vomiting, these will likely continue until all the cancer cells are removed from the body. Therefore, if you want to stop taking chemo, it's best to do so as soon as possible after diagnosis. This could be as little as one week following surgery or three weeks afterward. After your first round of chemo, it's wise to take a few days off to let your system recover before returning to work. You may also wish to limit your exposure to light during chemo therapy; that way you won't see any changes within the body. Remember that chemotherapy isn't the same as radiation therapy (or radiotherapy). Radiation is used when there is no hope left, while chemotherapy is used when an entire tumor has been removed. However, as we've seen above, all chemo treatments can cause severe physical problems and some people may even go into shock. So always check with your physician before deciding on a course of treatment.

There are several types of chemotherapy drugs currently being used:

Lithium is commonly given as either oral (oral) or intravenous (IV). Lithium is taken orally as a pill. A single dose of lithium pills takes approximately 10 minutes to come down in your bloodstream.

People with MS may also wish to pursue a career as a teacher or counselor for others with MS. These individuals are permitted to do so under a special exemption from the ADA. However, they must be able to demonstrate that they would not otherwise be qualified to perform the duties necessary for employment as such. Therefore, it is important to know whether you qualify for this exception before making any decisions about your future as an educator or counselor.

Q: What is covered by the disability insurance program (DI)?\nA: There is no specific definition of disability, but DI covers certain medical expenses related to MS, including medical care, rehabilitation services, rehabilitative equipment, and prescription drugs. Generally, there are three types of benefits: (1) a medical benefit for those patients with moderate to severe disabilities; (2) an educational benefit for students enrolled in accredited postsecondary schools or colleges; and (3) an income support plan for low-income working families where some members receive more than 50% of their net earnings through government programs.

Q: How does the ADA apply to my child's school?

A: If you own and operate a private school, you must comply with all applicable federal laws and regulations concerning disabilities in education facilities and activities. Your child's school has access to Federal funds, including Title IV educational grants and scholarships. As long as the school complies with state law regarding education, it will not be responsible for complying with the requirements of the ADA.

The ADA requires that any student in a public school participate in all activities and facilities that are consistent with his or her particular needs and abilities. If a student cannot attend an activity because he or she has a disability, the school should make reasonable accommodations to meet these needs, including placing him or her on the disabled list when appropriate. You may consult with legal counsel if you believe your school has violated the ADA or another federal statute. In addition, be aware that many states require school districts to provide ""reasonable modifications"" for students with disabilities. Some examples include accommodating a wheelchair user who uses a walker, changing the seating arrangement of a classroom, moving a person with an intellectual disability to a separate seat, and changing or adding supplies and equipment.

Q: Is there any good reason for having a tubal ligation before you become sexually active?\nA: It is no longer recommended that women be sterilized before beginning sexual intercourse. In fact, it has been found in one study that the procedure could increase the risk of HIV infection by as much as five-fold. Even if you are not at high risk of HIV or other STDs, having a tubal ligation prior to sex might mean less chance of getting an STD during that time.

Q: What's the best way to prevent a pregnancy after I've had a tubal ligation?\nA: If you have not already started a family plan with your physician, he will perform an ultrasound scan on you and recommend fertility treatments such as donor eggs or sperm donors. Some doctors prefer to wait until you're fully fertile to start trying new birth control methods. This makes it easier to make sure a pregnancy does not occur.

Q: Do women have a right to go back into the uterus after tubal ligation?\nA: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends against this practice because of the risks associated with complications and death from uterine rupture after tubal ligation. You can read more about the risks of abortion and contraception here: http://www.ahrq.org/advocacy/abortion-and-contraception/.

Q: Can a woman get pregnant while undergoing a hysterectomy? \nA: No. A hysterectomy only removes tissue from outside the body. Your cervix doesn't enlarge. However, it may leave behind some scar tissue. If this happens, it isn't considered pregnancy since it won't result in delivery.

Q: Are all women treated similarly with tubal ligations and hysteroscopy? \nA: Yes. Both procedures involve removing part of the fallopian tube (the opening between the womb and the vagina). They both require follow up care as well as the same kinds of blood tests. Many women need to undergo further testing, though. These are called hysteroscopy scans. For example, a gynecologist might use special equipment to check the internal lining of your uterus. These scans aren't necessary unless you get other test results too.

gpt2-large_132,"headpats scalp psoriasis.

A: Head pats are a common symptom of psoriasis, and they don't usually cause any problems at all in most cases. For others, however, headpats may indicate an allergy or sensitivity to the hair-care products being used. There are three main types of treatments for headpats: laser therapy (light-based), creams and ointments (such as antihistamines) and topical steroids.


What is a typical day look like? A: One of the symptoms of psoriasis is that it's painful when you're not shaving. The pain can be so intense that you need to use your hands every few minutes to minimize the effect on yourself. You might even have trouble wearing clothes without having to hold them up over your head. When we think about these kinds of discomfort, we probably imagine someone who has suffered from the disease for decades, sitting cross-legged in a chair with his face pressed firmly against the pillows. Unfortunately, many people do not experience this kind of discomfort at all—they simply complain of ""headpats"" sometimes after shaving. This isn't actually true; it's more likely that the psoriatic patient complains of headpats because he hasn't shaved enough recently. In such a case, his body has been spending time repairing damage caused by years of hair loss. However, some patients also suffer from milder complaints of headaches and stiffness during the day.

Q: How long does it take to heal? A: It depends entirely upon how much scar tissue is left in the skin. Most psoriatic patients recover completely within two months if treatment with one of the different types of creams and ointments is continued. Once the initial inflammatory process is gone, the healing process takes longer than usual. In fact, healing times often vary widely depending on the size of the area involved and whether it was shaved lightly or heavily. Some people will only need to see their dermatologist once and then never go back. Others, however, will continue for several weeks to months until the underlying causes of the inflammation begin to clear out. And still other patients experience no improvement at all once their dermatologist decides what type of treatment is needed. The best way to determine if there is any potential problem with your psoriasis is to have your doctor perform a physical exam. Ask him or her to make sure everything looks normal.

In the early stages of MS, the symptoms may not be noticeable, and you might think they don't matter. After several months or years, however, your brain's memory can begin to slip, and you'll notice many things about yourself that are odd, unusual, or just plain weird. Your eyesight, for example, won't function as it should because of blurry vision; you may find that you need glasses even when you're wearing contacts. If you can remember what you ate yesterday, why didn't you eat anything last night, or how did you get there from where you were going yesterday—you've experienced some form of visual impairment in an MS patient before. This is called progressive degeneration (PD) dementia. PD does not necessarily mean that you will experience any loss of vision. In fact, most people who develop PD do not lose their sight completely, but simply suffer from blurred vision and/or other cognitive impairments.

It's important to note that not everyone who experiences these cognitive impairments will develop PD dementia. Some people with PD don't develop it at all. For example, someone with PD who has only had mild signs of disease (such as fatigue or low-grade fever) over the past several weeks doesn't appear to suffer from any serious symptoms during this period. On the other hand, those with a more severe neurological problem such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease, or Huntington's disease will often develop PD dementia later on, especially if they also have a history of infections in their digestive tract or blood vessels. People who develop PD dementia should always consult a doctor because PD may require surgery to remove some portions of the nervous system. Also, if you suddenly experience significant problems with your vision, such as seeing very small objects or being unable to make eye contact, be sure to see a doctor right away!

Answer: A lot! Read it all. Every day for about 10 days. The instructions are simple enough that you can learn it on your own before you start nursing, but keep them handy just in case. The whole process takes less than 30 minutes per day (depending on what type of diaper bag you buy). You'll also want to give yourself plenty of time to get over the fear and frustration you will feel when trying this out. If you're having trouble remembering where to put things or if it seems like some items might be missing, try placing them next to each other on your nightstand instead of in your diaper bag. (This makes it easier to find what you need.) Also, try to avoid putting anything in your diaper bag that could hurt your child. Some common culprits include: large pieces of fabric, wet wipes, cotton balls, pacifiers, water bottles, hair clippers, glue sticks, needles, small objects, etc., as well as any type of sharp object (including knives, scissors, or razor blades), as these are not safe to put into a toddler's diaper.

Also, remember that while it may seem like your child gets an extra diaper bag at every feeding, that isn't true. The actual number of times a mom uses her baby's diaper bag varies from one month to another depending on the type of diapers she uses.

Answer: a number of studies have been done showing that patients with MS are less likely to develop chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in response to chemotherapy than those without MS, but this study was short-lived and has not yet been replicated in larger cohorts. There is also no evidence that low levels of TNF-alpha will cause problems for people who have high levels of it. The best advice would be to limit exposure to TNF-alpha through medications such as corticosteroids or immunosuppressants such as aspirin, which can lower blood TNF-α levels.[13] It may also help to avoid taking medicines containing histamine, particularly in older adults or children, and use antihistamines if possible, especially if you have had an allergic reaction or experience any other symptoms.

The good news is that even if your immune system is impaired there are ways to make it stronger and fight off infections - especially for chronic conditions such as type 1 diabetes, asthma or arthritis. You should still seek medical attention when you notice changes in your symptoms, for example loss of appetite or weight gain, or unexplained vaginal discharge.

If you have major depressive disorder (MDD), your doctor may suggest that you stop taking antidepressants immediately. They are often helpful in treating mood swings, feelings of emptiness, sadness and loneliness.

If you do not want to quit all antidepressant medications, or if they make you feel worse, discuss this with your psychiatrist. He or she will tell you what further treatment options might be available for you at home or in an outpatient setting. These treatments also include psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In addition, antidepressants may help you deal more effectively with stressors such as divorce or job loss.

You should also talk to your family members about their own experiences with mental illness. Often children of depressed parents experience more symptoms than other children of depressed parents. It can help if someone with bipolar disorder knows that his or her parent has been diagnosed with some form of mental illness. The mental illness may be treated by medication or therapy. Some people who suffer from bipolar disorder cannot tolerate the side effects of these drugs and will try alternative therapies such as meditation, yoga, or cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) if there is no effect on symptoms. Learn about your options so that you can choose the best ones for yourself.

What can we do to improve our mental health?

In addition to practicing good habits, we can take steps to ensure our emotional well-being and physical health as we age.

Meditation. Meditation helps us reduce anxiety and promote relaxation while maintaining focus and attention. There are many different types of meditation styles, including body scan, mantra, and visualization techniques. While mindfulness meditation helps you see the bigger picture, it doesn't replace traditional psychological approaches such as social skills training or talking about important topics. For example, if you want to become stronger physically, keep active and learn how to strengthen the muscles involved in walking, biking and lifting heavy objects.

Mood management. Medication and therapy work together to treat certain symptoms and prevent others. Depression, panic attacks and phobias often develop during periods of distress. Mood disorders such as anxiety, OCD and PTSD tend to worsen over time because of changes in our bodies and minds. We don't know everything about each person's genetics, brain chemistry or genetic predisposition. So getting better information through research and education is crucial.

It is a very important distinction to make here, because for many of us who are not diagnosed with BPD we may feel like the diagnosis doesn't apply to us, or that it's just an umbrella term for other conditions that we have. I've been reading this thread and seeing lots of people whose symptoms don't fit into any of these categories, so I'm wondering if there can be more than one ""borderline"" mental health condition. One thing I noticed when going through my own research was how much different things looked in different countries around the world; in Canada they call it Borderline Personality Disorder, but in New Zealand there's no such label at all (I think the only reference I could find for them was a list of symptoms). Is this a problem? If so, what might it mean? It would seem like it would help people more generally identify with their condition better if it weren't lumped together as ""borderline"". Or perhaps the question needs clarification. Maybe there's some way to separate the two?

(Response from Dr. D) The ""Borderline Personality Disorder"" diagnosis does not exist internationally. This is why most psychiatrists do not use that term. However, you should be aware that there is a diagnostic framework that exists, which has its roots in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM] - the same manual used by doctors worldwide (there is also an international version in the form of the International Classification of Diseases, Version 4 [ICD-4]). In the current edition of this document, the following types of personality disorders are categorized: Anxious/hostile; Psychotic; Schizoid; Antisocial; Narcissistic; Histrionic; Paranoid; Obsessive Compulsive; Sensory Gating; Disorganized; Dysfunctional interpersonal relations; Socially disruptive; Paranoid type; Dependent. The majority of DSM-5 proposals have focused on these five diagnoses. The DSM-III classification criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder included both a ""paranoid"" and ""borderline"" category, meaning that there were two groups of individuals, one with a paranoid view of the world and another without such a view, although either group had symptoms of the other type. In DSM-IV, these two classes have been merged. The new diagnostic system proposes that there be two sets of clinical characteristics, one for those exhibiting the traits of an anxious or hostile person, and the other for those displaying traits of a psychotic or",114,borderline personality disorder symptoms,-0.4391008615493774,22,question,9,0.2037037037037037,390,9

gpt2-large_107,"A lot of people have an adhd/anxiety disorder and they are just very sensitive to certain drugs. They may be sensitive to any type of drug, but many people who are sensitive to stimulants will get a reaction from a stimulant when they're using them. So if you take something like Adderall or Ritalin or whatever it is that stimulates your brain to produce more dopamine in the bloodstream then you might develop some sort of reaction. And I've heard that there's also a specific kind of sensitivity that occurs when you use antidepressants. There's been a report out there by the National Institute of Mental Health where someone was taking these sorts of drugs for depression and they developed this type of response, but not everyone reacts to all kinds of medications. For example, if you think about prescription pain killers - when you start with prescription painkillers you can sometimes feel their effect on the body for days after you take them, so if you use those as a treatment for pain you might not react to the same level of side effects as other people do, although you might still experience one or two of the typical negative side effects associated with prescription pain killers.

Question: What does being able to see my family, seeing friends and hearing their voices mean? Answer: It means you're not trapped inside. You can really communicate with people even though you don't always understand what they're saying. You might say things that make them laugh and upset them and give them hope. You might hear their stories and find yourself moving past something that happened or a part of yourself that wasn't healthy anymore. That makes it easier for you to move forward and overcome those things and you know, that's why a lot of us try to keep a close relationship with our families. It's good to talk to them sometimes because if we don't we could be in danger and they might die. We need to figure out how to stay alive together. It sounds weird, but I guess it's true.

In this way, all of us will be free from debilitating symptoms and no one will have to live in constant fear of death! The best way to treat multiple sclerosis (MS) today is through immunotherapy, where immune cells are injected into the body to attack the diseased tissues. If you suffer from chronic inflammation, it may take months for your immune system to recover from the first injection, which can often make treatment more painful and uncomfortable than if you had been taking traditional medications. Another approach to treating multiple sclerosis is an integrative approach using natural therapies such as acupuncture, meditation, yoga, etc., so that we do not become dependent on conventional medicine alone.

Q: Do you think that the government should provide a benefit/cost comparison for those who can afford private insurance plans? I am considering enrolling in private insurance but my husband says he does not see how it makes any sense. Is there anything you think about? Answer: There are currently only two publicly funded health programs – Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B. Each program covers roughly $9 billion per year, which means that they each cost approximately $11,000 per person in total annually. This figure includes the costs of covering people with disabilities such as high blood pressure and diabetes, as well as other medical expenses associated with disability (such as hospitalization), but excludes the costs of insuring individuals who choose not to purchase insurance coverage. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that the combined annual expenditures for these programs amount to about $200 billion. Because each of these programs also provides financial support for public services such as home care, child care, education, and social service programs, it is important to consider whether one could pay for these services out of their own pocket without paying into these programs directly. When evaluating the value of various health care options, consider the overall cost of providing health care through either federal or state government funding sources. As with every health care decision, it's important to determine what will most benefit the individual.

A: In this case, the only thing that might work is to remove all references to ""Microsoft"" from your system files. To do so, you can use this command at a Windows command prompt:

bcdedit /set {default} DisableAllWindowsCodes True bcdedit /set {default} EnableAllWindowsCodes True

The two commands above will tell Windows about the default setting for each type of document and set it to true (or false) for both Windows 2000 and XP. If you want to keep using other versions, just copy over the appropriate one. The instructions below assume that you are running Windows 2000 or 2003. You should note, however, that there's no guarantee that any particular version will behave the same way in the future.

Beware: Be careful when removing these settings because if they're not removed, those files may later be reinstalled again when someone else tries to edit them. There are some good reasons why you shouldn't delete documents. Here are a couple of examples:

The file has been modified by somebody else in a way that makes the changes permanent. This could happen when you update something on your computer; especially if you've updated the.EXE,.MSI, or even.COM files (which might contain security holes); or if somebody takes ownership of the file (for example, by adding a new owner to the group). These kinds of things happen often enough that you should leave these files alone. However, if you really need to make certain that your files aren't deleted permanently, you should probably create a backup first (as described later in this topic), which requires that you know what permissions your users have on the files (either through Group Policy or an account-based password system such as Active Directory Domain Services).

You have an older version of the software installed. By default, newer versions (such as those available from the Internet) come preinstalled on most computers. If you install the old version, then you must run the installation process again, usually after you upgrade to the latest version of the program.

gpt2-large_92,"there are many different types of fatigue, with some being more severe than others. For example, while you may not experience fatigue from sitting for long periods, it is common to have a ""feel-good"" effect from sitting for a long time. This can be due to a combination of your physical and emotional state (though, it is also possible that the feeling of relaxation, happiness, or contentment from sitting may lead to the body's ""fight or flight response"") or simply because you are more aware of how your body feels at any given moment.

In general, an increase in activity level can cause discomfort and pain. The most obvious signs of this include cramps, backaches, stomach pains, headache, or mild dizziness. Other symptoms include headaches, fatigue, muscle aches/pain, sleep problems, etc.

Causes of fatigue in MS\nAnswer: there are several factors that contribute to fatiguing. One factor, however, is likely the primary culprit. It is usually due to insufficient blood flow to your central nervous system, which leads to reduced blood circulation, slowed heart rate, and difficulty getting oxygen to all parts of your brain. While not as frequent as chronic fatigue syndrome, other factors like hypertension, alcoholism, eating disorders, and depression may make a person susceptible to falling asleep during workdays or getting too little exercise on a regular basis.

Other Causes of Fatigue In MS\nAnswer: a variety of medications, including anti-anxiety medications, mood stabilizers, antihistamines, sleeping pills, antibiotics, drugs used to treat certain conditions, and even over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen. Many people believe they do not need these medications or just take them as directed. A study by the National Institutes of Health showed that taking anti-anxiety medication as prescribed was associated with higher rates of daytime sleepiness, poor concentration, increased tolerance for alcohol, and increased risk of falls, but only if those prescriptions were taken on a daily basis. Similarly, drinking and smoking cigarettes seem to aggravate fatigue symptoms. Alcohol abuse, especially heavy drinking, can worsen insomnia and reduce concentration. Smoking can exacerbate MS symptoms by causing insomnia, making you feel tired or irritable. People who smoke are often unable to stay awake when their body's circadian clock does not work properly.

gpt2-large_22,"yes, it is true that you will develop type 2 diabetes as a consequence of the high level of fat intake. But I do not think this is a reason to stop eating meat and butter. To me it seems more rational to eat a diet rich in plant foods than a low-fat one. There are many good reasons for vegetarians to include animal products.

Q: can vegetarians be diabetic?

A: No. In fact, some studies suggest that people with type 1 diabetes may have higher risk for obesity because of their lower carbohydrate consumption (6). However, these differences were mostly due to an excess of carbohydrate. People who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet tend to consume less carbohydrates than those on a low-carbohydrate diet, which means they have more energy available for exercise during the day. Thus they tend to lose weight faster compared to people on a typical Western diet (7) – the difference between the two diets was about 25% after eight weeks. That said, if you are trying to keep your weight under control then reducing the amount of protein and fat you consume might reduce your risk for future weight gain. A vegan diet does not seem to have any significant effect on the risk for type 2 diabetes. One study showed that vegetarians had much lower risks of heart disease than did nonvegetarian men (8). Another study found that vegans were less likely to die from cancer than were omnivores (9), although other research has shown mixed results on whether vegans suffer more from cardiovascular diseases than do omnivores (10). Finally, there is a large body of evidence suggesting that vegetarians and vegans should be healthier overall than are nonvegetarians and most of the time they are (11). So even though vegetarians do not appear to be at increased risk for type 2 diabetes, they may still benefit from avoiding refined carbs. It is also important to note that it's possible for many people to become overweight without having type 2 diabetes, although many factors influence the rate of weight gain in this population. For instance, women with breast cancer usually weigh less than men, but they often have more visceral adiposity, meaning they store calories in the abdominal area. This could make them heavier than would otherwise be expected (12). Vegetarians who are lean may actually have more muscle mass, allowing them to maintain their normal weight. As well, there are many other factors involved; see below.

A person can also develop multiple sclerosis if they've had a stroke and their blood vessels become damaged. In this case, there is no treatment available. Many patients with multiple sclerosis report having trouble walking, swallowing or remembering things. Some people may experience cognitive impairment, vision changes or hearing loss. It's not known which specific areas of the brain are affected by MS but there are some research studies suggesting that an area called the temporal lobe may play a role.


In most cases, symptoms will pass within three months after being treated and many will never need treatment again.

gpt2-large_86,"As with most diseases, the progression of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis is not linear. There are many factors that contribute to the development and progression of this disease including age, genetics, treatment, and environmental factors (e.g., medications, nutritional status). Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis: The primary progressive multiple sclerosis stage can be broken down into two separate phases: early-onset and late-onset. Early-onset is when there is no change in symptoms but is characterized by a single or partial loss of movement of the upper limbs. In these cases, patients typically experience pain on one side only for about 4 weeks before any worsening occurs. Late-onset is when symptoms worsen over time and the patient has difficulty walking due to limb weakness or paralysis. Patients who have both early-onset and late-onset MS usually require an advanced course of therapy at least 6 months apart.

What is the diagnosis? What is the prognosis? What causes secondary progressive multiple sclerosis? Is the diagnosis correct?

The diagnosis of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis depends on the characteristics of the individual case, the specific cause(s) of the disease, as well as the presence and severity of symptoms.

Is it possible to get sicker with each successive episode of MS?

This question was asked frequently during the initial rounds of clinical trials. However, this question needs to be reevaluated because the overall incidence of new onset MS has risen dramatically since the 1980s. For example, from 2000–2004 the incidence of first MS episodes increased by 50% while the number of subsequent cases declined by 45%.

If you think you may have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, you should consider contacting your healthcare provider. You may also want to ask if you will need further testing before receiving treatment. If so, you may wish to consult with a neurologist or neuropsychologist (a mental health professional trained specifically to diagnose MS), a pediatrician, or a genetic counselor.

There is no reliable way to test for MS. To find out if you are susceptible to developing MS, some experts recommend testing for the antibodies to TNFα, which are present in large numbers in people with active MS and appear to play a role in preventing new disease recurrence. But testing for these antibodies is expensive and rarely available. And even if antibody tests were available, they would probably not give you much information; however, they might be useful as screening tools against other types of autoimmune disorders, such as lupus erythe",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-0.0201654303818941,11,question,9,0.08270676691729323,410,17
gpt2-large_93,"Yes. It is not unusual for those with MS to suffer from insomnia or forgetfulness. There are a number of factors that may lead these symptoms, such as the nature of the illness, age and sleep habits. The most common cause of chronic insomnia in MS patients is lack of adequate quality sleep. This can be due to difficulty falling asleep and excessive daytime napping. As previously mentioned, many studies show that the proportion of patients who cannot fall asleep during the night was over 50% in the late 1990s.1 In addition, there have been reports showing an increased incidence of sleep apnea among MS patients compared to healthy controls.2-4 Although no conclusive data are available on this issue, there appears to be a link between sleep apnea and MS.5-7 Some researchers suggest that excessive sleepiness in patients with MS may interfere with their ability to regulate their bodies' natural circadian rhythms and contribute to the development of disease.8-10

MS is known to be associated with the presence of a wide range of systemic disorders.11 These include myelin damage (which damages the myelin sheath around nerve fibers), fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, autoimmune diseases and several others.12 Therefore, it is important to discuss whether chronic sleep disturbance is related to the occurrence of a variety of clinical disorders and how they might affect one's functioning. Sleep disturbances also play a role in the pathophysiology of other conditions, including depression, diabetes mellitus and obesity.13,14 Additionally, it has been shown that certain types of sleep loss can impair cognitive function15,16 and that sleep deprivation can result in long-term negative consequences17,18 and even death19 at times.20,21 Despite being more prevalent than any other psychiatric disorder, it seems that most people do not understand why this condition exists. A few people may believe that the main reason people experience poor memory is because they spend too much time awake while driving. But although driving does make us feel sleepy, we do so in small amounts and we rarely miss a turn.22 While many people are aware that they need less sleep than they did 15 years ago, they still have trouble understanding what causes this phenomenon and what is the best strategy for improving our daily schedule of sleep.23 Understanding MS will help you understand how your own body functions and helps you better manage the disease.

gpt2-large_72,"No, it does not. The drug was originally developed to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a cancer of bone marrow cells that develops in patients with MS. When you take CML medicines or receive injections, your immune system attacks some of your body's cells and prevents them from working properly, leading to severe disability and even death. So if you're on one or more CML drugs like glatiramer acetate (GPA) or cyclophosphamide (CyPh), or have had other diseases caused by their use, the disease may be worsened by the corticosteroid medicine. Because the drug is so effective against this cancer, many doctors prescribe it to all those who are taking these treatments and believe its benefits outweigh any potential risks.\nOne study published in the Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology found that over two years, patients treated with Covid-19 had significantly worse outcomes than those receiving placebo. Also, patients given the drug were also less likely to develop an infection, such as MRSA or fungal infections. In another study of 30 patients, 10 of whom received CML chemotherapy, and 7 of whom received placebo treatment, researchers did find that those who took the drug experienced mild side effects such as headache, fatigue and nausea. But there wasn't enough data to draw conclusions about long-term safety.\nAnother study of 21 patients with relapsing-remitting MS found that both the active and placebo groups lost at least 5% of muscle mass during therapy. And there was no difference between the two groups in how quickly the loss occurred. However, none of these symptoms would necessarily lead to serious medical problems, according to the FDA, which regulates drugs used to treat MS. \nA recent study showed that patients who got the medication before they developed progressive spasticity (aka ""spasticity"") suffered far fewer side effects and had better recovery after surgery compared to those whose pills arrived later. \nAccording to a 2004 article in the British Medical Journal, the FDA decided to approve the corticosteroid agent for new uses only after concluding that the drug doesn't cause muscle pain or stiffness when taken alone, but it can worsen the condition. It also stated that ""no additional medical information has been identified regarding the risk associated with taking CCT."" The agency said that because ""there is currently no evidence to support the clinical application"" of the drug, it will continue to review the matter. \nIn fact, it didn't stop there.

gpt2-large_79,"No, because it is not an inheritance. The second question is why don't we have a law that says you can only pass one disease down by your own bloodline. In other words, if my wife inherits this disease, and then passes it on to her children in her next generation, then the children of those children are NOT considered sick or diseased. What would be the point of a law against inheritance if the offspring would NOT get this disease? The third question is how do we know what genetic mutations are inherited by siblings?\n\nIf there were no genetics involved then our society would collapse under its own weight. We would probably have no sense of decency. The answer, I believe, lies in the study of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y chromosome DNA (Y-chromosome).\n

In general, mtDNA (pronounced ""muh-TAY-din"") is passed from mother to child through each daughter's gamete membranes. Y chromosomes, which carry genes, are inherited exclusively by males. There may be some females who inherit their father's sperm. But since so few women carry the Y chromosome, men with Y chromosomes cannot pass them along to their sons. \r

There may be exceptions, however. A number of studies show that about 30% of all female carriers of the X chromosome produce healthy children without any evidence that they themselves carry the defective gene. This suggests that these women had no direct maternal lineages. Therefore, they must have had an additional male source of the defective gene. If such individuals existed, they might provide an explanation for the unusual occurrence of diseases in women with X chromosomes.\n

I'm curious as to whether or not you think something needs to change in order to make this a reality. Thank you for your time!

A: There seems to be a lot of misconceptions about how to treat prostate cancer and how to diagnose and manage it based on where it occurs. However, the majority of cases are misdiagnosed. About 20% of men with low-risk prostate cancers will develop metastatic disease, while approximately 80% of those diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer will die within five years. The difference between these rates should not be misinterpreted, however. Although the majority of low-risk prostate cancer patients will undergo surgery in order to stop the progression of the disease, approximately half will also receive radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy to decrease their chances of developing metastasis. Therefore, the average survival rate for this group is at least 5 years, and possibly longer.

Q: I am very interested in the potential link between male sexuality and sex differences in prostate cancer risk. For example, if men were born with higher levels of testosterone then they would have a greater chance of developing prostate cancer than women due to the fact that testosterone promotes growth and development of prostate tissue and affects the ability to function as a reproductive organ. Conversely, if men were born with lower levels of testosterone then they would have a lesser chance of developing prostate cancer because the hormone does not promote growth and development. It is unclear whether or not the latter hypothesis holds true, so my question is as follows: If men have more or less masculine behaviors, does this translate into increased or decreased risk of getting prostate cancer? Please help me understand this better!

A: I don't know whether or not there is an association between masculinity and male sexual behavior. What I do know is that more research is needed to determine the extent to which males' sexual behaviors influence how likely they are to develop prostate cancer. That said, I think it's safe to say that both",116,outcome prostate cancer,-9.451878547668455,109,question,9,0.43951612903225806,442,19

Q: Should I get the vaccine? Answer: No. The safety and efficacy of the influenza vaccine has not been established. Some patients experience serious adverse reactions after vaccination and should seek medical attention immediately. Vaccination is a good idea if you or someone in your family will be at high risk for complications from the flu. However, it is important that everyone else with these risks also receive this vaccine; however, there are no specific precautions necessary for those who do not have other health conditions. It is unknown whether the vaccine would prevent all cases of the disease.

Stage 1:

Stage 2:

Stage 3:

Stage 4:

Staging of Stage 1 is a complicated process. It begins with a complete physical examination and includes blood work, chest x-rays, ultrasounds, MRI scans, and other tests. All of these are done to establish the location in your body for any cancer that may be present. The following is a quick description of each stage, as well as an overview of the various possible outcomes from this stage of treatment. These pictures depict staging at each stage, but not all stages can produce a picture like this. As you can see, only four areas of the body are targeted by chemotherapy; the liver, lungs, spine (vertebrae), and pancreas (bile ducts). Some cancers have multiple targets depending on their size, and some have none.


Liver Cancer

The first step in treating a tumor that has spread to one or more organs (lung, heart, kidney) involves removing a sample of the tissue (biopsy) and analyzing it for evidence of disease progression. This is known as ""pancreatic histopathology,"" which is similar to taking a biopsy of a person's stomach. If there is cancer around the organs that were removed from the patient, then the doctor will order additional studies to determine whether further surgery should be done.

In most cases, there is no need for additional surgeries until the cancer is in one of these critical areas. For example, if the cancer has spread down through the abdomen, then surgical removal of the gallbladder could be needed.

If there is no evidence that cancer has progressed in any of these locations, then surgery may still be needed for some patients whose tumors had grown into vital organs such as the brain, heart, and kidneys. In those instances, however, surgeons would typically use less aggressive treatments to kill off the cancer, so they would remove the organ(s) while preserving as much as possible. Once the surgeon removes the organ, he/she then makes sure that the remaining tissue does not spread to the lymph nodes or other nearby parts of the body.

When a new type of cancer develops, it tends to cause fewer complications than when a previous cancer was diagnosed. Therefore, a second biopsy is often necessary to confirm that the diagnosis is correct before surgery can begin. Another advantage of the earlier biopsies is that they allow doctors to rule out many forms of cancer in",117,stage 4 metastatic lung cancer outcome,-3.623565196990967,27,question,9,0.10887096774193548,403,15

gpt2-large_96,"I think if you go to a natural food store, they'll sell you a lot of different stuff. You can get an entire plant based diet for $2 or less. And then some people do get really strict on it by limiting their carbs and protein, but that's not what we want in our body as humans. We have to be able to break down the foods we eat into smaller components.

If you've ever eaten at a restaurant where you had a big portion of meat or dairy, that was a mistake because you just ate too much meat or dairy. That's what your brain does when there isn't enough energy for everything else. Your brain works off protein and fat (and water) to keep you alive. If you're eating lots of sugar, those are going to make it hard for you to keep up with all the other needs. So let's look at what's actually healthy for us to consume:

Fats – The fats in food are our first line of defense against inflammation. If you were to take away all fats from the diet, your cells would start making inflammatory molecules called cytokines which promote inflammation. This is why saturated fat is so bad for you. It turns out that omega-3s like DHA and EPA are even worse than saturated fatty acids in this regard and may be even more important for maintaining good health. They also help reduce inflammation because they lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, so having high amounts of these types of fats in your system makes sense, especially if you're trying to maintain a balanced nutrient intake. Some research has shown that supplementation with the type of fish oil found in soy milk may protect against cardiovascular disease and cancer.

Vitamins and Minerals – Vitamin B12 plays a huge role in the human immune system. People with poor circulation problems tend to have trouble absorbing vitamin B12 and need to drink plenty of water throughout the day. Vitamins C and E both play a role in helping to prevent muscle loss due to aging and illness. Fish oils contain niacin and B6 which act as antioxidants and help to repair DNA. These nutrients also support normal digestive function, so consuming enough should improve health overall. A number of studies have linked the consumption of fish to reduced risk of heart attack and stroke.

Phosphorus – Phosphorous is another very important mineral. Without adequate phosphorus in your body, you cannot synthesize proteins nor absorb essential vitamins and minerals like calcium. In fact, your kidneys can only process around 3 grams of phosphorus",96,most efficient and sustainable diets,-11.149678230285645,19,question,9,0.2111111111111111,439,15

Psychotherapy has two aspects: 1) helping people learn to change their behavior (2) changing our attitudes about ourselves or others in order to improve outcomes for ourselves, our family and society. Psychologists define a behavior as anything that affects another human being - whether it's making someone angry, controlling them, avoiding them, hurting them. The goal of therapy is not only to help us become better people, but to make us more compassionate, understanding, loving, respectful, empathetic, and caring.

Asking yourself questions like ""what is empathy?"" ""how does my behavior affect other people"", ""do I act out because I am afraid/insecure?"", or ""are people hurt by me"" will get you a much deeper look at your relationship with others - and hopefully help you change it!

In this article, I'm going to give some examples of things psychologists say can trigger anger, which are known as ""triggering situations"". My hope is that if you listen carefully, you'll be able to avoid some common triggers so that your anger doesn't turn into something unhealthy.


1. Making Someone Feel Uncomfortable / Unable To Do Anything About It (e.g., crying, yelling, getting upset)

If you've ever had to explain yourself to people who don't want you to have an opinion, then this is probably one of those situations where you're likely to receive an uncomfortable response from them - especially if they think you know more than you actually do. If you ask them what makes you upset, they might respond like ""Oh, just...I was being mean."" Sometimes when people feel threatened, they may also express feelings of guilt (""Why didn't you tell me?""), but these aren't necessarily signs of anger. They could simply be responses to stress - which usually begins with having to deal with someone else feeling unsafe around you. Anger isn't often expressed when we're stressed, and in fact, it's most easily triggered when we're under stress or emotional stress, such as during a conversation, or when someone says something that upsets us. Stressful situations cause us to become overwhelmed, and even though our reactions might seem harsh to others, we realize that it's because we were trying to protect ourselves or others. You can imagine how much easier it would be for you if we all reacted to every bad thing that happened instead of letting everything go without saying anything!

4. This should be followed by a 2 year period of normal eating patterns, including an increase in fat consumption, decreased salt intake and increased dairy products.

5. The diet should include lots of vegetables, whole grains, fruits, lean meats and fish (preferably from wild caught). Avoid alcohol, caffeine and processed foods (like potato chips and sugary drinks) with added sugar or starch.

6. You may need additional calcium supplementation during periods of low calcium intakes or when you have very high blood levels of calcium.

7. Vitamin D supplementation should never be given without being properly diagnosed and evaluated by a physician. If vitamin D deficiency occurs, a supplement should be started immediately.

Question: Can I take a daily probiotic pill? Answer: Yes, if you are taking a prescription medication for diarrhea and/or constipation.

Question: Can I have my period without an appointment? Answer: No. If your period is more than four days long, or occurs on consecutive days, you need to see your doctor immediately. You may also be referred to a reproductive endocrinologist who can perform tests that can determine the cause of irregular periods. Your gynecological physician will evaluate whether your current contraceptive methods are suitable for you.

Question: How often do I need Pap smears? Answer: In most cases, you only need one per year. However, in those circumstances where your health insurance does not cover pap screening, you should discuss with your provider the possibility of seeking Pap testing through an alternative means (e.g., self-pap testing). This information should help you choose the test(s) that best meet your personal needs and goals.


If your healthcare provider determines that you should undergo another Pap smear, you must schedule this visit before the next scheduled exam. Once the procedure has been completed, you may begin using oral contraceptives again.


You should continue to use condoms during sexual intercourse during any Pap smear, even after having had sex, until you find out about any negative pregnancy test results. The purpose of a Pap smear is to detect abnormalities such as cancer cells (a Pap smear cannot tell when you were pregnant), abnormal uterine bleeding, ovarian cysts, and other medical conditions that could affect your ability to become pregnant or lead to miscarriage.

You are likely feeling a mixture of anxiety, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath, or tightness in the throat.

These patients can easily find themselves spending several more hours in the waiting room, even though their condition was just reported on the website for the first ER visit they ever had.

Q: What if I don't want chemotherapy? Can I just stop taking it?

A: Yes, but the chemo will take longer than normal to work because of the higher levels of hormones in your blood. That's why some people who are using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for their breasts may feel they have more pain during and after treatment; this is not a good sign! The reason why chemotherapy takes so long is because estrogen levels are reduced by HRT in order to lower the risk of ovarian cancer. If you are doing HRT in combination with an anti-estrogen pill or a progesterone injection, you should see your doctor as soon as possible to schedule a follow up appointment at least 6 months after treatment.

If you choose not to use HRT, you will still experience chemotherapy for 1 year; however, it may be much harder to get off the drug because of its side effects. In addition, you will probably experience loss of appetite, increased hair growth and weight gain, and a change in menstrual cycle.

You can stay at home with your family for a week or two to get back into it after having surgery and have an opportunity to go back into school; and, if you're really good, you'll be able to do that on your own. But there are limits -- as we've said before, there's no guarantee you will be able to continue working or studying at the same level once you leave MS. \n

Your doctor may suggest that you take some kind of medication. That could include medicines like Prozac (fluoxetine) or Paxil (paroxetine). It also might include medications such as Ritalin (methylphenidate), Adderall (amphetamine) or Concerta (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate). Some doctors prescribe a combination of these drugs called ""Combined Therapies."" Many people find they need them because they have trouble concentrating and remembering what they need to do and when. Others find they don't benefit from taking them but want to give themselves a chance to see if they could use them. If you decide to try any of those treatments, you should talk with your doctor about its pros and cons before deciding whether to start it.

Another treatment option that has been recommended by many physicians is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, which focuses primarily on how you think and behave while you're sick. This type of therapy usually involves listening carefully to a series of questions in order to learn more about yourself. These types of treatments aren't widely available in Canada, but you can find information online.

If you have severe symptoms of MS, one way to help reduce the severity of your symptoms is through medicine. The treatment options discussed above provide you with important support -- both physical and mental. Doctors often recommend medication to treat serious illnesses, including MS.

gpt2-large_77,"Although the exact cause of MS is not known, some researchers believe that certain factors may increase a woman's risk for MS and other autoimmune diseases. For instance, some studies have linked MS with certain hormones in women (e.g., estrogen) or lifestyle choices. Other research has shown an association between menopause-related problems and the production of proteins called cytokines by immune cells called T helper T cell lymphocytes (ThT). Since cytokines are important for keeping healthy immune system functions intact, they might play a role in the development of MS. Finally, there is evidence to suggest that menopausal symptoms may be related to decreased levels of circulating estrogen.

Menopausal symptoms like hot flashes, bloating, fatigue, and weight gain are common among women who don't get diagnosed with MS. As time goes on, these symptoms usually go away. However, some women may experience additional symptoms such as increased pain and joint pain during menstruation (menorrhagia), which can last longer than expected before resolving. This condition is referred to as amenorrhea. Women may also develop other conditions in addition to MS related to their menstrual cycles. These include endometriosis, osteopenia, and pelvic inflammatory disease. Menstrual blood clots and bleeding around the uterus (amniotic fluid embolism, PMDD) can lead to stroke or heart attack. It is very difficult to predict whether an individual will develop any of these issues later in life because many factors influence both menopausal symptoms and MS symptoms at different times.",77,How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?,-0.0320711620151996,0,question,10,0.0,242,13

There is growing evidence that many chronic diseases may be treatable at an earlier stage with a simple lifestyle change. In particular, there is strong evidence that people who drink alcohol do not live longer than those who do not drink alcohol; therefore, these factors must be considered when designing public health interventions.\n\nIn order to develop effective prevention strategies, it is important to understand which specific conditions lead to chronic disease and how they can be prevented. The following table summarizes the causes and causes-related effects of each of the leading chronic diseases listed in Table 1 of the WHO Human Health Index (1): \nFigure 2 shows the relative prevalence of different types of chronic diseases across countries (2). A number of global differences are evident, ranging from low prevalence of tuberculosis to high rates of hypertension, obesity, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and various cancers, among others. To explore the relationship between alcohol consumption and certain types of chronic diseases, we use data on lifetime and current alcohol consumption. For example, if someone consumes 10 g/day of ethanol, but has no history of drinking or heavy drinking, their lifetime average alcohol consumption would be <10 g/day, so they will have only minor effect on their risk of developing any chronic disease. Conversely, the same person consuming 30 g/day of ethanol would be at increased risk of having a hip fracture, diabetes mellitus, or other type of chronic disease.

A crown has three layers of tissue: the inside, middle and outer. Each layer acts as a guard to protect against external pressure and helps create an environment that allows the tongue to move freely around the mouth. A root will be located at the top of each layer. When the tooth is moved toward the tip it creates pressure on this area; therefore, if there is any obstruction in that area, the gums will feel like they have been punched through with a sword or something else sharp enough to puncture the skin below them.

When someone has a gum infection, these areas will swell up so much that they need special attention. However, there isn't actually anything wrong with a tooth that needs to be removed, just with your oral health. If someone has a really bad bite, then I would recommend getting dental care to correct the problem. Also, if there is some trauma (like a gunshot) that causes swelling, then the doctor may want to take out a portion of the tooth and replace it with a smaller tooth.",105,wisdom tooth cuts gum pain,-10.753042221069336,45,question,10,0.569620253164557,211,5

gpt2-large_131,"I like to lie down with my back straight, head up and eyes open. When you are sleeping on a pillow or in bed, this is not a bad idea as well. You can also try sitting at your desk or on the couch. If you have trouble getting comfortable, place one foot against the floor. Then move it until your body feels good. As long as your spine stays healthy, all else will work out just fine.

Other tips: Try to keep all of your joints loose so that they can't hurt when you bend over (this goes for most people). Use a brace on your knee if possible; don't wear anything too tight around your neck. Don't sit on pillows or furniture; use your knees instead. The whole goal is to relax your shoulders and make them look more relaxed while stretching. Make sure you get enough sleep before doing any exercise. It's better to go to bed early than to be awake late!

If you do choose to take part in an exercise class, remember that doing it on your own will probably be much easier and you'll see results faster.

Also, take care of your breathing: always breathe deeply through your nose by closing your mouth and taking a few deep breaths out the nose. And don't force your chest forward because that means you're working for maximum oxygen flow to your brain. So keep your head back and keep your chin held high. A little bit of breathing doesn't hurt either. Just focus on how your breath feels. If you feel like you need more air, simply inhale slowly and hold that position for a second.

The main thing about exercising? Resting between sets. That way you'll know how hard you worked and whether you actually got better. So if you went from 30 minutes to 2 hours, take a day off before you start again. This would mean resting between every 10 sets of each workout – or 4-6 weeks if you're using a heavy resistance band.

Once you decide what kind of program works best for you, find a strength coach who specializes in yoga and fitness.

And if that doesn't work, you might be able to tell if something's wrong by using this simple test. The doctor will put a tiny piece of metal into your hand, and see what happens when he touches his index finger to your thumb. It should come out limp at first, but then it may become stiff and hard as he tries to touch it. This shows that there is some damage, so the doctor needs to take the thing out immediately. When it does, take off the bandage, and call your doctor right away.

Q: I am having trouble swallowing my food. Why?

A: There are several reasons for this, but one has to do with how long your stomach has been empty. Your throat should feel dry and full after eating. After that, the digestion starts all over again until you feel full again, which takes about 5 minutes. That means you've eaten less than 15% of the meal!

The same goes for beverages such as water and tea. They usually contain an extremely small amount of liquid in them, so it just takes another 10-15 seconds before you feel full. As soon as you begin feeling full again, drink more, because you're basically going to need it again. (But really, that little bit of liquid is not important, and you shouldn't worry about the extra calories.) Once you start drinking more, keep doing this, and eventually the urge to eat goes away without much effort. The point here is to start out slow and build up to the point where you only have to stop once every 20-30 minutes.

gpt2-large_132,"The problem with hair growth, particularly on the face or neck is that it does not stay in one place and thus can grow to larger sizes. This can make skin problems worse when you have a lot of them and they are growing out of control. It also may be a sign of more serious problems (e.g. melanoma). When this happens, treatment might need to be done in some parts of the body for a long time.

- What kind of medication do you use? - Answer: There is no standard medication used to treat facial hair growth (other than laser treatments) but most people use topical products containing salicylic acid. These include lotions, creams and gels such as Permethrin, Alka-Seltzer, Neutrogena Hair Gel, and many others. You will also want to read about using these for other kinds of hair conditions. You should try to avoid all over-the-counter medications that contain aspirin, because you may be taking too much at once.

- If I am allergic to something I can't get rid of... - Answer: Most drugs cause an allergic reaction, which is when your body reacts to the substance by making its own immune system do whatever it needs to do to attack the object causing the allergy. Anaphylactic reactions usually happen within minutes. So if you're going to use a medication, don't wait until it's too late before changing it. Remember, anything you eat that contains sugar is probably going to trigger an allergic reaction in someone so keep it away from foods that are high in sugar like candy, fruit juices, coffee, etc. Also remember that medications come into contact with skin, so do not rub any part of yourself near medicine!

- What are some common side effects of topical or oral medicine? - Answer: Common side effects are itching, redness and swelling after application, irritation to eyes and mouth, burning sensation in hands and feet, nausea and vomiting. Be careful of all medicines and only switch if needed. Some people find that certain types of medicines have an adverse effect on their acne. Make sure to check all directions prior to starting. In addition, some medicines cause allergic reactions if taken internally. That includes antibiotics. Read and follow the instructions carefully.

- Are there any alternative methods of treating facial hair? - Answer: Yes, there are several options available and each has benefits.

What are my options for treatment after the first dose of a new medication?

Ask about what other treatments might be available in our MS Treatment Center where we can discuss options and provide guidance on treatment recommendations. There are many medications available that have been studied, but none are FDA-approved for MS. There are several different types of anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and others. These have specific side effects that require monitoring. Aspirin has been used for many years as an effective alternative to NSAIDs and is no longer recommended. Other types of painkillers are available to treat MS. Check with your healthcare provider before starting these medications so he/she knows how much to prescribe. If your MS is severe enough to affect your ability to drive, your physician might consider prescribing pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol). For chronic conditions like cancer and heart disease, there are also non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDS) and non-steroidal anti-depressants (NDRs).

How does treating MS improve quality of life?

When people who have MS are treated with medicines, they usually become more active and able to function at their normal levels. This means they can spend more time doing things they enjoy. In addition, MS patients often notice improvements in their mood, energy level and overall well-being. Many MS patients do not realize that their condition has improved until they take another prescription medicine or go on a walk. It's important to remember that improving one's health means making choices to make themselves healthier, which can include changing diet, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep and eating foods high in whole grains, fruits and vegetables.

Post 45 I'm 32 with severe eczema. I got it while living in California. My doctor diagnosed it as chronic eczema and prescribed steroids and cortisone cream.

Recently, my mom got really sick and didn't eat for 3 days (my daughter is about 15). One thing we discovered after she came back is that her eczema hasn't returned. She went to my house, saw me in bed, and told me I need to see a dermatologist to make sure this problem isn't going away because I am still experiencing symptoms. So I took my sister and dad there. The doctor asked about my eczema and what was causing it. He gave me some antibiotics and said if it keeps coming up, I should call him. The next day, he called me and said he heard something I thought wasn't right (it turns out, it was): itchy bumps around my mouth and/or throat. He said I shouldn't drink anything or chew gum.

What is the cause of my trouble getting pregnant?

The reason for this problem can be complicated and it may be related to many different things. The main cause seems to be one of the following reasons:

1) You have not taken any medication that could interfere with the production of estrogen (such as birth control pills). This leads to abnormal hormone production and leads to irregular periods. It might also lead you to get multiple miscarriages during your lifetime. 2) Your body does not absorb certain substances well - meaning some substances become trapped inside your uterus and don't reach your ovaries or fallopian tubes. If these substances come into contact with the lining of your womb, it can cause a condition called ectopic pregnancy. 3) You are a heavy smoker. Smoking increases estrogen levels and decreases progesterone. When the hormones balance out, it makes it easier for the egg to implant properly. 4) You have diabetes. This increase in hormones will make your blood sugar level higher and cause an imbalance between what is needed by your cells and what they need from you. 5) You are breastfeeding. Many women experience postpartum depression because their milk supply is low. Breastfeeding causes your breasts to grow, but they do not produce enough milk for your baby to drink. When you stop breast feeding, your hormones will go back to normal (and this time, they will help you deliver better-quality babies), but the loss of milk supply will still take a long time to recover. 6) Your menstrual cycle has changed. A woman who has stopped menstruating usually experiences heavier bleeding after her period. Also, if she stops having a period at all, she might continue to bleed while giving birth. 7) Your fertility is affected. Some women are born with high concentrations of oestrogen in their blood. This results in a higher risk of breast cancer later on in life. 8) Your hormones are abnormally high, which can result in anemia and other health problems such as asthma or osteoporosis. 9) Your diet is unhealthy. Certain foods can contribute to an excess of estrogens. Eating too much red meat, eating too little fish, being overweight, and consuming excessive amounts of caffeine can all have negative effects on your hormonal balance. 10) You live in a cold climate.

Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis \r

What is MS?\r

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a progressive form of multiple sclerosis that affects approximately 1 in 200 people worldwide, affecting some 2 million individuals. The exact number of cases has been estimated by MS Society International since 2000, but estimates vary widely because only a small fraction of people with MS actually get MS. With time, however, many cases of MS can lead to disability or even death, as seen with patients like former NBA player Yao Ming, who was diagnosed with MS three years ago. When someone develops MS, symptoms appear at least five days after starting treatment; they become worse with time and can last up to two years. Even though MS is not curable, most people can expect their condition to improve over time. People with MS often live longer than average without developing significant disability; however, for those individuals who do develop MS, disability typically lasts between 3-5 years. It's important to remember that this means that if someone has MS at age 60, the chance of them being disabled before 65 years old increases to about 5%. However, if you're 55 and still have moderate or severe symptoms, you could potentially end up having lifelong disabilities and even die before you reach middle age!\r

Symptoms of MS include pain, numbness or tingling in one hand or foot, fatigue, muscle weakness or loss, joint or nerve aches, vision problems, hearing problems, cognitive issues, depression, and memory lapses. Treatment generally consists of medications such as oral anti-inflammatory drugs and NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents), oral corticosteroids, immunosuppressants (such as steroids and chemotherapy medication), and sometimes surgery. The duration of treatment depends upon the severity of the symptoms. The treatments themselves can differ depending on the type of MS. The majority of MS sufferers have no symptoms of any sort",63,Will multiple sclerosis affect my career?,-0.0122524220496416,2,question,10,0.008,403,6

Q: What is the treatment for Multiple Sclerosis?


A: The most important treatment to fight this disease is lifestyle, and a variety of diets are available.

There are several kinds of diets that can help in fighting MS. However, there are no proven treatments or cures yet.

gpt2-large_54,"Multiple sclerosis is a condition that affects the central nervous system. It causes a loss of muscle control and pain in joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments and other tissues. In some people, it also produces problems with vision, speech or balance. People with MS can be diagnosed with it from time to time because they may experience symptoms. The severity of these symptoms changes as your age increases. For example, if you are aged 50, it might start out being mild, such as joint pain, swelling and an increase in difficulty falling asleep. As you get older, however, things will become more severe and you could develop long-lasting disabilities. If the signs and symptoms worsen or there's no improvement after two months, you should see your doctor. Your GP may refer you for tests (such as MRI scans) to diagnose MS. You should not have any treatment until this test results are known. Some symptoms will improve over time; others may require ongoing treatment. Read more about MS Symptoms and Diagnosis.

Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis – Blood Tests A blood test called an anticoagulant antibody testing (ACAT) is used when you're diagnosed with MS. This test looks at antibodies against a type of protein found on red blood cells. Antibodies against this protein help prevent blood clots. Many people with MS react very badly to their anti-MS antibodies, causing them to bleed easily and experience a range of short term effects including diarrhoea, fatigue, numbness and tingling around the eye and nose, dizziness, sensitivity to light, blurred vision, poor hearing and poor memory. Other symptoms can include headaches, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pains, weakness, skin rashes, depression, fatigue, confusion and anxiety. While many people with MS live normally, others need to take extra care if they do come down with a serious illness like pneumonia or flu. Learn more about Anti-Microbial Therapy (AMT).

Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis - Psychological Testing Anxiety is one of the main triggers for MS. Often people report feeling anxious around someone new or going through a difficult time. They worry about what to say or how they'll look. To help you cope better, a psychological assessment may be done by trained professionals who know more than you think about your symptoms. These tests aim to find out whether you've been diagnosed with a mental health disorder or if you need professional support. These tests can help guide your therapy so it fits into your life best and helps you feel well.",54,What does multiple sclerosis diagnosis include?

gpt2-large_52,"There is no one single answer to this question. A person's physical and social environment plays a significant role in their mental health, and often the individual has had some form of adversity that contributed to their condition. However, for the majority of people who suffer from any mental illness, the problem does not stem entirely from an issue within the individuals' own mind. In fact, research shows that many people do not experience symptoms until after they have experienced at least two life-threatening events (e.g., sudden death, accident, serious injury). Mental Health Awareness Month presents a unique opportunity to highlight these important issues so we may help reduce instances of suicide and other forms of mental illness for all Americans. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) has developed an annual theme for April 20th called ""Suicide Prevention"" which highlights how best to reduce suicides in our society through education and prevention programs. Each year, the APA also releases a report entitled ""The Facts About Suicide,"" which provides information about the risk factors of suicide, as well as some specific actions you can take.",52,What are the most common mental health problems?

gpt2-large_51,"The word ""healing"" as used in a medical context has two meanings. One meaning of the word is ""the treatment or cure by which health is restored to an injured, ill, diseased or sick body."" As part of that definition, holistic doctors are treating their patients with natural healing methods (including herbal medicines). Another meaning of the word is ""a system of thought and practice based on sound science and principles derived from the Bible, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Taoism, Christianity, Judaism, Islam and all other religions that seeks to restore balance between man and nature by means of the application of proper food, clothing, shelter, rest and relaxation.""

The term ""holistic"" is also frequently confused with ""holistic,"" which means ""of the same nature."" But this isn't entirely accurate. Holistic medicine can be both ""natural"" and ""cosmetic"" treatments; they may have many similarities but also differences. For example, some people use supplements without knowing whether any of them work. In fact, you don't need a doctor's prescription for most types of supplements--they come in pill form. Some uses for herbs, vitamins, minerals and dietary supplements vary greatly because each one has its own unique purpose and needs. In addition, there is no set standard for what constitutes a ""holistic"" approach to wellness. Many holistic practitioners try to apply all of these different methods to achieve optimal health in their patients. This variety makes sense when considering how often different therapies are applied in our daily lives. Each method is equally effective, though using one can help a patient heal more quickly than another.

How does holistic medicine differ from conventional medicine? To answer this question, let's take a look at the following list of common treatments:

1) Drugs: Most drugs are categorized as either drugs or dietary supplements. These substances affect human behavior and physiology so they must be evaluated individually before being prescribed. By contrast, holistic physicians evaluate all possible causes of illness and propose remedies based on scientifically proven and validated principles. Examples of commonly recommended pharmaceuticals include anti-depressants (such as Prozac), antipsychotic medications such as Risperdal, antidepressants (like Paxil, Zoloft, etc.), muscle relaxants such as Tylenol and muscle relaxers (such as Aloe Vera/Glycerol). The FDA, however, requires manufacturers to provide specific warnings about side effects before prescribing certain products to children under 16 years old, pregnant women, and those with heart disease",51,What is holistic medicine and what does it include?,-0.046696089208126,2,question,10,0.0106951871657754,394,29
gpt2-large_114,"Yes. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) was revised in 2013 to include a definition for BPD. However, there is no evidence that these new criteria are reliable enough or specific enough to make it clinically useful.

BPD: A new diagnostic term?


The term ""borderline"" has been used to describe an array of mental illnesses with varying levels of severity. It includes an assortment of conditions like depression and anxiety disorders. People diagnosed with BPD have recurrent episodes of intense anger and destructive behavior and often act out in dangerous ways such as running away from home, stealing cars, etc. They may also engage in repetitive behaviors and self-harm and may attempt suicide or kill themselves. There is also more subtle forms of emotional problems including mood swings, irritability, low self-esteem, impulsivity and difficulty regulating emotions that can last over several months or years.

For those who struggle with the diagnosis of BPD, it's helpful to know what types of BPD symptoms we're talking about here; the following list is not exhaustive but will give you an idea:

Panic attacks – this is when people experience extreme panic attacks triggered by something they find upsetting or threatening. For example, if your spouse leaves unexpectedly or a friend stops calling you, it could be an instance where you feel overwhelmed and have an unproductive time. Panic attacks can affect everyday life; they might happen during social occasions or at work. It may be easier to manage when a person has experienced them on occasion before.

Frequent physical aggression toward others – This kind of aggression involves frequent assaults, threats or acts of physical violence against others such as hitting someone, punching someone or kicking someone. It usually happens only occasionally, so a person's relationship to the aggressor doesn't seem to matter too much. Sometimes it might occur with minor disagreements such as arguing over a parking spot or complaining about how much food he or she left behind after dinner. In cases where one partner is extremely violent towards the other, it can lead to serious psychological consequences.

Hypothyroidism can cause a number of physical and mental health issues. It's generally not a good idea to have more than one thyroid in your body, especially if you are pregnant or trying for a baby. A diagnosis of hyperthyroidism should be confirmed by medical professionals who examine both the thyroxine (T4) levels as well as other signs like depression, lethargy, sleep disturbances, loss of appetite, weight gain, headache, fatigue, increased hair growth on the head and chest, poor concentration, nausea/vomiting, heart palpitations and constipation. You'll want to see an endocrinologist, particularly if you're also taking medication for depression or anxiety disorders. Read my article about the effects of hypothyroidism on pregnancy here. And check out this link about how to properly diagnose hypothyroidism.


The above question is also relevant because many women with thyroid conditions will experience similar symptoms. If they don't want to go through the pain and worry that accompanies going off their medications then it might be worth looking into options such as natural herbs or supplements. Check out this website for more information on natural treatments for thyroid problems. The following questions may sound rather silly but are very important to understand so you know whether to take them seriously or dismiss them as just being ""misunderstood"". For example, how do you tell when someone has hypothyroidism? Is there even a difference between hypo and hypothyroidism? Do people develop hypothyroidism at different rates and does the severity of symptoms change over time? Does hypothyroidism occur frequently or only during certain periods of time and why? What about autoimmune diseases like Hashimoto's disease, Graves' Disease, lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis, which all share common underlying causes? What is considered normal thyroid function and how much thyroid hormone production should we expect? These are all important questions to ask yourself if you are thinking of seeking treatment for hypothyroidism.

Thank you for your time!


My name is Karen, and I am currently in need of an internship at a major medical center because of my chronic pain syndrome (CPS). The reason I'm looking for this position is because my insurance covers only one doctor's visit to be evaluated and treated for my disorder (I have other health problems as well) so there isn't much more we can do besides pay for the hospital stay, which will cost between $500-$1,000/day depending on how long they take me or how serious my problem is. And if this doesn't work out, then hopefully I will find another medical provider who does cover her visits and medication costs.


So far I've had some success paying for outpatient treatments, but not all of them. I would like to eventually get into a facility where I'll also receive in-house medicine and therapy. If the job pays well, then it could save money since it won't have to go through a third party provider.


Here are two questions you may want to ask me:


What is my expected length of stay? A few days should be fine if I'm being admitted due to acute stress or any other reason, but a month or more is pretty extreme. I'd prefer to make a deal with my employer before agreeing to a longer period of time than that.


How many appointments/hours do I need to see/attend during each appointment? I really don't know what a typical day looks like without having to come back to work, but I can give you estimates based on what you say is normal. For example, I usually try to meet up every week from 9am to noon so I have an hour to walk around the building or meet someone for an interview if it's open. So assuming that's average, it might mean that I just need to attend 7+ appointments in 2 weeks, which wouldn't be unreasonable given the length of time needed for treatment.


Do I need to bring along any medications? I usually tell people that I don't need anything as long as I take them whenever I feel comfortable. My current medication consists primarily of Valium, Depakote, Tylenol, and Advil. Anything else would be good too, I guess.

What is MS?\n Answer: Your immune system attacks white blood cells, called T-cells, that protect your body against infection. The most common type of attack on the brain occurs when a person's own white blood cells are damaged or destroyed. This damage is caused by an autoimmune disorder (an illness in which your body is unable to fight off disease). According to some experts, one in four people have this condition. It can occur at any age but typically starts before the age of 30 and progresses over time. Symptoms include blurred vision and other visual problems. In addition, many patients report memory loss and difficulty concentrating. About 1 out of 4 people with MS have had the disease for 10 years or longer.\n

MS symptoms are different from those seen in other types of autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis or systemic lupus erythematosus. When diagnosed with MS, people usually lose their ability to walk, talk and swallow, but they don't necessarily go into a coma or die. While it doesn't affect daily life, the lack of movement can cause major depression, anxiety, fatigue and other physical problems, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. People with MS are also at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease.\n

2. Multiple Sclerosis – an autoimmune disease associated with destruction of nerve cells within the brain and spinal cord causing neurological issues. The most common form is called relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. This type of MS has been linked to a number of other conditions including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Tourette Syndrome. These include postural tachycardia syndrome, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome (RLS), depression and anxiety, depression-like behaviours, cognitive decline, and visual loss, among others.

3. Fibromyalgia – this condition, also known as ""the body's own worst enemy"" is characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, swelling and stiffness in some areas of the body, especially those muscles that control digestion, bowel movements, sexual function, and movement. Although not quite as severe as MS/ CFS it is a serious illness and often leads to disability due to reduced mobility, restricted range of motion and difficulty chewing, swallowing and speaking. In addition fibromyalgia sufferers are at increased risk for depression, low self esteem, poor self care, lack of energy, headaches and irritability, insomnia, fatigue, high blood pressure, kidney failure, bone fragility, heart attacks, and cancer, among other things. As a result many patients with fibromyalgia develop suicidal thoughts, even death. They may use drugs like Prozac and Zoloft or try other treatments such as acupuncture, massage, herbs, chiropractic, homeopathy, vitamins, physical therapy, and prayer.

4. Fibrous Myofascial Pain Syndrome - this condition occurs when the tissues of the lower back are compressed under tightness and strain resulting from repetitive motions. Symptoms include chronic tension headaches, neck pain, shoulder pain, low back pain, arthritis, muscle aches and pains in different parts of the body, cramps in the groin area, painful muscles around the knee, knee sprain, and low back pain. Many patients report being unable to sit up straight. Another symptom of FMPS is numbness in one side of their bodies and tendons and tendons across the foot.

What is insulin?

Insulin is an enzyme which helps to manage blood sugar levels. It does this by converting glucose (sugar) into energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). This process is called ""diabetes management"". A person's body uses a certain amount of insulin over time as their blood sugars rise. Insulin works best when taken with food and can cause side effects if consumed without adequate nourishment. When insulin has been given, glucose will flow through the blood vessels faster so that there is less need for more insulin. As a result, the patient may feel hungry or hungry less often, feel tired or fatigued, or experience other symptoms including thirst or urination. It also takes longer for blood sugar levels to return to normal.

How is Type 1 diabetes diagnosed?

Type 1 Diabetes is caused by genetic defects in the pancreas (the cells where sugar is produced), hormone imbalances and other factors. Treatment includes regular check ups, nutrition counselling and lifestyle changes. The diagnosis is usually made when a person begins to have signs or symptoms of diabetes and their doctor suspects that they could develop the condition themselves at any point in life. Some people who are already diabetic have no symptoms; however, many find symptoms begin suddenly during pregnancy or shortly after birth.

Treatment options include anti-insulin drugs such as metformin and glucagon (when combined with oral medications) which act on both the pancreatic and endocrine systems, reducing the production of insulin and increasing the ability of blood glucose to pass freely from the bloodstream through the small intestine. These medicines help control glucose levels in the blood and prevent damage to surrounding tissues. In severe cases, treatment options include surgery. Surgery removes part or all of the large intestine, causing the pancreas to produce less insulin. However, this approach is often used only if there is significant damage to the intestines (e.g., injury to the gallbladder) or severe illness. Other treatments like oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) are used to monitor blood sugar levels throughout the day. OGGTs measure how well someone can tolerate taking an intravenous dose of glucose or another substance containing glucose. They determine whether this individual can continue eating without suffering complications.",22,my risk for developing type 2 diabetes,-10.361740112304688,207,question,10,0.828,411,7

Q: What is the difference between acute and chronic MS?\nAnswer: Chronic MS is characterized by multiple episodes that are triggered by an immune response to a particular antigen. Acute MS may be caused by another disease process or by environmental factors like pollution. In either case, there is no cure for chronic MS.

Q: How many people have it each year in the U.S.?\nAnswer: At least one million Americans suffer from at least one form of MS. Some estimates suggest as many as four million people in this country had their first episode of MS within the past two decades.[20] Most cases occur before age 25 years. The incidence of MS varies widely across the United States and around the world. Some evidence suggests a higher prevalence in certain areas than others.[21][22] As the number of people with MS continues to increase in the United States, the overall burden will continue to grow. Many individuals with MS experience serious health problems such as blindness, paralysis, loss of bodily function, and other life-threatening complications. While current treatments for MS prevent these illnesses, treatment can also result in long-term disability or even death. There are currently over 100 medications on the market for treating MS, but most are prescribed off-label for use in combination with other therapies. Additional research is needed into newer drug targets for inhibiting the inflammatory response, controlling inflammation, and improving neuroprotection. These findings could lead to new drugs that target specific pathways involved in the development of diseases including MS. There has been limited research conducted on using gene therapy to treat MS. Current data indicate that some forms of the disease may respond better to gene therapy compared to non-genetic approaches. However, the potential benefits of gene therapy are still uncertain and must be evaluated carefully.[23]

Q: Can genetic testing help determine my risk for developing MS?\nAnswer: Genetic testing does not predict whether you develop MS. While genes are believed to play a role in MS pathogenesis, they do not provide any specific information about whether your risk will go up or down based on your genotype.

gpt2-large_93,"Multiple Sclerosis is a neurological disorder that affects the brain. It involves abnormal signals from nerve cells, which are responsible for controlling movement and sensation. People with MS also have damage to their central nervous system (CNS). The CNS can be affected by disease such as diabetes or Alzheimer's Disease. Symptoms of MS include changes in vision, balance, muscle tone, hearing and swallowing difficulties. Some MS patients may experience memory loss due to changes in synapses, the connections between neurons. Sleep problems are often found in people with MS. It is known that sleep disturbances are linked to some types of dementia.\n

Sleep Disorders - Sleep disorders cause most of these symptoms: poor sleeping quality; disturbed dreams and REM periods in which you do not feel awake after waking up; inability to fall asleep or remain asleep when your body is moving; difficulty falling asleep on its own; and difficulty staying asleep. These conditions are usually related to problems with how the nerves communicate. Poor sleep can affect memory, thinking, mood and physical function. A person who has trouble falling asleep at night might experience this problem more frequently than someone without sleep problems. One study found that 65% of people with MS had frequent nightmares about sleep problems, compared with 13% of those without the condition. Another study showed that 66% of people with MS experienced daytime drowsiness when they were tired but did not need rest. When we wake in the morning, our bodies release melatonin, which helps us sleep. This hormone controls many aspects of our circadian rhythm. If a person experiences nighttime fatigue during the day, he or she could develop a sleeping pattern that is similar to that of people with other sleep-disordered diseases such as narcolepsy. In addition, it appears that many people with MS experience sleep apnea during the course of their illness. Apnea occurs when the airways become narrowed, causing a sudden increase in breathing rate. Sometimes this leads to an unpleasant or even dangerous situation for the person. It is best not to attempt to enter an apartment if you hear any loud noises. If a person becomes restless while lying down, try standing up first, then lie down again. Sleeping patterns of people with MS are different from that of people with Parkinson's disease, which has less impact on their mental functioning and is also associated with sleep disorders. Sleep apnea is one example of a sleep disorder that is characterized by frequent episodes of shortness of breath during sleep. Other sleep disorders include insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), both of which are common",93,Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?,-0.0104262195527553,2,question,10,0.010101010101010102,435,30

The vaccine has been shown to be protective against the development of disease (such as relapsing remitting or inflammatory demyelinating diseases) within 12 months after vaccination. However, this protection may not last beyond six months. As with any type of immunization, there are risks associated with certain side effects, including serious infection and death from infection. Therefore, it's important to discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor before deciding if you're ready to receive the vaccine.


Q: Do I need more than one dose to protect my children from getting MS? Answer: No. Although a single dose is necessary to provide adequate immunity, multiple doses can also help prevent transmission between siblings. For example, an individual infected by an adult with MS would likely benefit from several additional doses because he or she could still get sick from contact with a sibling who did not receive the shot. In addition, multiple doses may reduce the amount of time it takes for symptoms such as pain, fever, fatigue, joint swelling and tenderness to appear.


Q: Can you give me a copy of the current recommended schedule of vaccinations? Answer: We encourage parents to find out which vaccines they should bring their children for first aid training and then obtain additional copies when needed. You can print these materials from www.immunize.gov/vaccination/pages/recommended_schedule.htm. The CDC recommends that every child receive two doses of the MMRV vaccine on average during childhood (4-6 years old). If you'd like to learn more about vaccines available in your area or order them online, please visit the Vaccines & More section of our website at www.immunize.gov.


Q: My children are receiving shots. What should I do? Answer: When preparing a vaccine list, make sure each item is covered by insurance so that both families have equal access to the same schedule. While we understand that some parents are concerned about vaccinating their newborns without medical supervision, it is generally best to use your insurer's policy before you decide to vaccinate. Be aware that you may be required to pay extra fees for the ""unnecessary"" shots given to your baby. Most health plans will cover all items listed on the recommended schedules but plan to charge higher prices based upon your personal situation.

While I agree that not taking a steroid can be dangerous, I don't think that is what you meant when you said you don't want to see any excesses. If anything, I would suggest that you stop taking one now before you get more serious symptoms. Also, if the issue is less severe than being unable to urinate, then stopping will probably make things worse. I also wouldn't be surprised if you took a steroid with other medications so that you could avoid having to take them in combination (like aspirin or ibuprofen).


Q: When should I start treatment for prostate cancer?A: The most important thing is to find out exactly where your disease is in relation to your testosterone level, which, as we discussed above, is very difficult to determine. However, you may find it helpful to know how much testosterone you are currently making (a good place to start). For example, some men who are at low levels have no trouble losing weight because their body naturally makes less fat than they need. On the other hand, others might gain weight when they use diet pills, gain back some weight after switching to a lower-fat diet, or regain some weight when they stop taking supplements. It's hard to tell from looking at yourself whether you're on your way down the wrong path or whether there are really healthy ways to go about getting leaner and stronger. Sometimes it's impossible to say!


Q: How does therapy work? How long does it take?A: There are two types of hormone therapy - direct treatments and indirect therapies (which means using drugs to help stimulate your own production of hormones). Direct therapy uses injections or patches to increase circulating testosterone levels. This usually involves three injections once every week. Your doctor has to give you a prescription for these injections - it must include the recommended dose of testosterone. An average dose is 1.5 mg per day. So you'd inject 25 IU twice a week. Do NOT mix up doses - you'll be injecting the same medicine three times a week. To prevent side effects, keep the drug separate from all other medicines and apply only one half to each arm during therapy. Don't forget to follow instructions carefully - injection sites can become contaminated.

[0080] The risk of developing multiple sclerosis has been estimated to be between 10% and 20%. There have been studies that show an increased risk of development of multiple sclerosis in children who participated in vigorous physical activity or sports as early as 5 years of age.1-3

The risk is particularly low for women of childbearing age because their health tends to deteriorate over time.4 Women with MS also tend to be older and live longer, so their risk may increase when they give birth.5,6 For men, there has been a decrease in incidence among middle aged and elderly individuals.7,8 As a result, people in this group may face an increased risk if they engage in frequent physical activity.9 A study found that those who engaged in recreational activities had a 30% lower chance of developing MS.10

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) affects one in five adults worldwide, but rates fluctuate widely according to geographic region.11 In America, MS accounts for about 2 percent of all new cases; in Europe, approximately 4 percent of all new cases occur.12 Other estimates suggest that MS may affect 1 million Americans each year.13

While the exact cause of MS remains unknown, many researchers believe that environmental factors play a role in its progression.14-16 These include changes in diet, cigarette smoke, vitamin D deficiency, and genetic susceptibility.17 Multiple sclerosis occurs after the immune system destroys healthy cells or causes them to turn against themselves.18 It is thought that environmental factors, such as oxidative stress caused by certain chemicals, promote the process by which these damaged cells destroy surrounding healthy cells.19,20

Several dietary factors appear to be associated with an increased risk of MS. Low levels of intake of omega 3 fatty acids are considered to be one factor contributing to MS.21 Low levels of cholesterol may contribute to MS by increasing inflammation.22 Dietary fiber, which is often overlooked, may reduce the risk of MS.23 The fiber in red meat lowers blood pressure; the same holds true for white meats.24 Fruits and vegetables contain soluble fibers that help regulate the absorption of vitamins and minerals.25 Finally, some research indicates that gluten intolerance decreases insulin sensitivity and may lead to a greater amount of plaque build up on nerve endings in MS patients.26

Question: Shoulder and collar stretches, what should I do? Answer: This is also an excellent question, but you need to know exactly how long to do each stretch so that you are not putting yourself at risk of injury. The answer depends on the person who asks the question. If you have poor mobility, a single or double extension stretch may be adequate. With more advanced bodybuilders, there may be times when you want to get into full range, such as with a lateral raise (e.g., bench press), and this would require multiple sets. For people without good flexibility, either one or two exercises will suffice. Do not overdo the movement. This will limit your training potential by making you weak. In addition, many people find that the longer they hold out for their muscle contraction, the harder the exercise becomes. Thus, the longer you hold out, the more your muscles grow in size and strength. Your best bet is to do all four exercises for 2-4 minutes each. These exercises work all the major muscle groups, including the upper back, thoracic spinal column, shoulder, chest, lats, shoulders, triceps, calves, and glutes.

One way is to simply lay on your left side, and pull your right arm behind your back (or put your left hand behind your head) while using your legs to keep up. Another way is to use a chair, where you place your hands on both sides, and then just lift your torso off the ground. Still another way is to push your legs against a wall or hard surface to create tension from your arms. Some people choose to do these stretches on their own, others prefer to watch a video on YouTube, and still others will do them while working on their physique. Be sure to practice enough before trying anything.

Question: Shoulder and wrist stretches, which ones do I use? Answer: Since most people tend to stick their fingers down while bending your elbows, the last thing you'd want to do is stretch your wrists. However, since our bodies can extend and contract at any angle we wish, the next best move is the reverse wrist flex",130,neck and shoulder stretches,-0.0594510249793529,0,question,10,0.0,423,14

Q: is there any way to prevent or reduce the severity of these conditions? i mean does anybody know how to get rid of them or what causes them?


A: The short answer is no. There are several things you can do on top of all of the above to help reduce your chances of getting cancer. One of which is keeping hydrated! Hydration increases immunity and helps improve skin health in general. This also applies to most cancers but specifically, melanoma and prostate cancer. You should drink plenty of water during times when you're exposed to UV radiation. To learn more about drinking lots of water read this article. Also keep in mind that the amount of salt in your body matters. A normal range is around 1 teaspoon per day. However, a high level of salt can increase your risk of developing kidney stones (hence why people tend to lose weight after losing too much weight) and osteoporosis (which is caused by low bone density). So, if you take on too many calories from processed foods, it may affect your mineral levels and lead to unhealthy bones. Additionally, eating less sugar (and/or refined carbs) means you'll end up with lower cholesterol levels and will feel better overall. Lastly, remember that there's nothing wrong with having a little bit of extra fat. It just doesn't seem to make any difference in terms of your chances of getting cancer or preventing it altogether.",101,heavy flares swelling lymph nodes,-12.700007438659668,96,question,10,0.7804878048780488,295,0
gpt2-large_96,"yes, the best diet for you!

Q: Why do I get fat?A: your body needs to burn energy during exercise. The faster that it burns calories, the more muscle mass you will have!\nFor example, if you are running an 8 miles a day at 60mph, every 15 minutes your metabolism will be burning around 1,000 calories, which equals 4lbs of fat each week. If this is not enough to keep you full until bedtime, then you should increase your calorie intake!The only way to lose fat without starving yourself is by eating well and exercising!\nThat's why people don't eat anything but vegetables when they are working out, because it keeps their metabolisms going. Even some athletes who are not active have a good amount of protein in their meals so they can recover quickly after heavy workouts and continue training.\nIf you want to look bigger, then you need to gain weight. But, if you're skinny then losing weight isn't easy...So, eat lots of healthy foods. Keep them low on sugar, high in proteins and low in fats. And, take care of your skin too!\nWhen eating healthy food, try to keep all the ingredients as simple as possible. A little water helps to dilute the taste of the food, so make sure it doesn't taste bad! Also, avoid processed meats or any other unhealthy products. You need to use your imagination. Try new things every now and then. When eating fresh fruit, choose small amounts to see how much you get. If you consume large quantities of sweeteners, then you may find that the sweetness gets diluted in your stomach. Sometimes there's nothing wrong with simply drinking fruit juice and enjoying the flavor it gives.\nAlso, never add salt to your food. It makes you feel bloated and weak, not healthier. To help to digest all the nutrients in food (carbohydrates and fiber), eat slowly and break up big chunks. Don't overconsume, but don't overeat either. When you have plenty of food, you won't notice any difference between eating two meals and one meal.\nFinally, remember that not everything you eat has to be healthy. You can still eat junk food or even snacks (a lot like candy) to fill up your belly and get away from your diet. Just remember what we said before about getting rid of sugar! We didn't say to drink soda. \nSometimes eating healthy is hard, especially if you are struggling with",96,most efficient and sustainable diets,-10.59643840789795,17,question,10,0.18888888888888888,404,10
gpt2-large_53,"therapy is a tool that helps to understand, control and/or change behavior. It can be used by parents, doctors, teachers, counselors, social workers, students or anyone who wishes to learn more about how to make the behaviors they want less likely, or how to help them feel better.

The most common form of psychoanalysis is called ""talking therapies."" It involves talking with the patient about their problems and feelings, then developing strategies for dealing with those problems. Psychoanalysis is often used in conjunction with psychotherapy, but it's also useful alone. In fact, there are many different kinds of psychotherapy. The most popular is known as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which focuses on understanding your thoughts and emotions and making changes in them, rather than changing reality itself. CBT may include techniques such as mindfulness meditation, cognitive restructuring, and self-talk. Other types of psychotherapies focus on helping you develop skills to cope with anxiety and depression, and work with you to find out why these things happen to you. These treatments vary from person to person, depending on the type of treatment being provided, what the underlying causes are, and whether the therapist is trained in treating mental disorders or not.


Psychodynamic therapy is another kind of therapy where the goal is to understand the root causes of emotional and behavioral problems. Psychoanalysts think they have found that some people suffer from pathological patterns of thinking and behaving, while others do not. As part of this analysis, the psychologist will talk with the client about his or her problems and try to figure out ways to treat them without hurting someone else. Psychoanalytic techniques like hypnosis or deep breathing are sometimes used along with other approaches.

Meditation, cognitive restructuring, and speech therapy involve trying to bring people up to speed with the way their mind works; the methods they use to think; and ways to manage negative feelings. They're especially important because many people can't tolerate stress and can experience extreme reactions to it. Cognitive therapy is focused on learning new ideas, improving ones we already know, and replacing old bad habits with good ones.

Many therapists specialize in one kind of psychotherapy or another. For instance, some psychiatrists study the psychology of grief and trauma, while others teach people to identify and process anger and fear. Others focus on working with patients with conditions like anxiety, eating disorders, chronic pain, or substance abuse. Many schools now offer special programs for children and teens that incorporate psychotherapy and related classes into curricula",53,what is psychotherapy?,-0.575066089630127,11,question,10,0.06111111111111111,420,9
gpt2-large_108,"I am a female and have had a history of long-standing, severe chronic diarrhea. Although this has been my lifelong problem, it started when I was about 16 years old. This is the only time I have ever experienced this type of gastrointestinal disorder; however, there have been other times in my life where I've also suffered from a similar condition. As far as my overall health goes, I feel like most people do, that I am doing well. However, if you take a closer look at my symptoms, you will see some concerning signs. For example, I can lose up to 15 pounds easily and sleep for less than an hour every night. My skin becomes extremely dry and itchy after having a shower. The lack of circulation affects me so badly that I often suffer from cramps and sometimes even die from them (see: death by dehydration).

I've also noticed that my muscles become very weak. It takes days and weeks before I can get around properly without feeling tired, weak or sore. All my friends say that I'm just plain weird. At least I don't go out drinking excessively (I usually drink water during the day) or taking too many stimulants. I would never be able to eat healthy food with full stomachs since I have such a deficiency of calories. I think I'd probably end up on my deathbed, if I lived that long!

The reason behind all these problems? Well, I guess it's because I haven't eaten healthy foods for quite some time now. And the more I tried to make myself healthier, the worse things got. So what did I eat back then? Lots of pasta, white rice and potato chips! Why does it work? Well, let's see…

Back in the mid-2000's, I heard one of the doctors I went to speak with tell me that he thought that a lot of people suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome weren't actually experiencing any problems at all. In fact, he felt that they were actually enjoying their ""normal"" lives. He told me that not everyone who suffers from CFS needs medication to deal with it, but they definitely needed help with eating. After reading through his book, he said that this wasn't true anymore. When I first read this, I felt very discouraged. But when I found out why the doctor felt this way, it made sense to me!
