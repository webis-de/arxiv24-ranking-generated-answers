# Evaluation of externally generated rankings
This script is used to evaluate rankings not generated in the indexing pipeline in this repository, i.e. in this case the rankings generated by ColBERTv2 in its respective repository.
The evaluate_external_results.py script takes the ranked passages from a ranking pipeline as input and calculates the ndcg@10, map and bref scores for them for the 3 different dimensions of relevance, credibility and readability.
