1,Question: What are the most common chronic diseases? What effects do chronic diseases have for the society and the individual?\nAnswer:,"In a word, disease. Disease is one of the greatest afflictions that exist in human beings; it makes them poor and weak and weak-willed. If they live through these years without any ill effects from their conditions, how much better off would they be than if they did not live!\r

The following is an excerpt from the ""Manifesto"" given by Dr. Arthur Danto, M.D., F.A.C.P.: \n

The main point being, as you can see, to try and encourage more people to read this book. It really is a great resource - very easy to read and understand. I think that this book should be in every school in America because it will help make you aware of what your body is doing to you every single day. The second thing we need to know about our bodies is that they are constantly changing. Our metabolism changes. Some days we feel like nothing is happening. We go to sleep thinking that we'll wake up and everything will just be fine again. And then we realize that we've had too little rest that week or that month, but when we check on ourselves later on, we may find that we're starving, dehydrated, exhausted, or tired. This is normal. We don't need to worry about all of those things though. Our bodies are designed so that they take care of themselves. We get sick when we eat too many calories and we suffer when we exercise too hard. These aren't life threatening situations. They happen to everyone at some time or another. What you have to remember is that there isn't one reason why you got sick and don't need to worry about it. You could have gotten sick for any number of reasons including poor diet, bad water quality, stress, drugs, etc. Don't let anyone tell you that you shouldn't worry about getting sick. There is no reason why you couldn't end up with a cold or bronchitis or pneumonia at anytime you wish. Just because someone else doesn't get sick, or doesn't seem to experience symptoms that you do doesn't mean it's not possible. Remember: the only way to avoid illness is to live healthy lives. That means eating right, exercising, and avoiding smoking. Those are things which you can change on your own. Do something every day that helps you keep active! As far as the medical profession goes, the best advice I can give you is, if something is bothering you, ask a doctor. Most doctors will","We live in a ""modern"" world that is full of health problems, but there are some diseases that remain very prevalent. The list below includes common illnesses like asthma, diabetes, arthritis, heart disease, cancer, etc…

The first two diseases listed above represent the big ones. These two major ailments affect more than half of our population. However, these diseases are not just associated with modern lifestyles and technology. Even though we may be aware of them or even suffer from one or several of them, they can still impact us. For example, diabetes has been linked to a number of medical conditions and this makes it extremely hard for patients to manage their condition while on an active lifestyle. Heart disease seems to be growing at a rapid rate as well. While this problem was once thought of simply as a sign of old age, many people today believe it's also caused by excessive exercise and poor diet. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) has been identified as a serious ailment, but its causes continue to elude scientists. This is especially true when it comes to its genetic roots. There may be thousands of different genes involved in CFS, so which specific gene is causing it is unknown and difficult to determine. Although scientists know that stress is the main cause for these disorders, it does not explain why certain individuals are susceptible to each type of illness. It should be noted that many of these illnesses are treatable through simple changes in lifestyle. For example, obesity has been proven to help reverse many diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, etc…

What can I learn about my own life by learning about these common health issues? Some of the common health concerns may seem trivial to you, but if you're already battling one of these conditions then your daily choices might make a huge difference for others who are suffering from similar conditions. If you're interested in pursuing a career in medicine, you could become a physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant (PA). You could even become an internist. Many physicians come from families with previous careers in other professions such as law, teaching, engineering, journalism, etc… Physicians also spend more time practicing than non-physicians because they work long hours and travel frequently. As a result, they often take care of sick family members, friends and neighbors as part of their day jobs. An important note is that all of the above illnesses are preventable. Your actions now could actually save lives later on. In fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),","Chronic diseases are any illnesses that can lead to long-term disability, and this is mainly related with physical or mental disorders. Some of these diseases will affect your career directly as well. For example, diabetes mellitus (DM) affects a person's ability to exercise and move around, causing an increase in risk factors such as obesity and cardiovascular disease. Other chronic conditions can also cause problems such as high cholesterol levels and osteoporosis, which can affect both the body and the mind.

Q: What happens when you get sick? Answer: There are different ways for individuals to become ill. If people suffer from one chronic condition, they may be exposed to other related ailments. For example, if someone suffers from depression, he/she may not take their medication as prescribed due to anxiety. This may result in symptoms such as insomnia, loss of appetite, nausea and diarrhea. A person may also develop new health problems such as allergies, lung disease and heart disease. Finally, some types of chronic illness can worsen existing mental disorders by increasing stress on patients' nervous systems.","Chronic disease is a serious health problem that impacts the life of the individual, family, or society. There are many types of chronic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, cancer, depression, arthritis, etc.. These diseases can cause pain, loss of vision, hearing, mood, sleep disturbance, obesity, fatigue, decreased quality of life, and other problems.\r

\r

Q: How often should we be worried about our health?\r

\r

A: You should always be concerned with your physical well-being because it affects everything else in your life. This includes health care expenses (i.e., insurance premiums), food costs, housing costs, transportation costs, and any other costs you may experience as a result of illness, injury, infection, or disability. \r

\r

Q: Is there anything that you've learned from this survey that you'd like to share?\r

\r

A: I hope this survey will help people understand their own health concerns and how they could improve them. It's also an opportunity to provide information about various things related to the study, such as possible questions or topics for future surveys. \r

How much does it cost to get well?

The average annual cost of health care in the United States was $9,076 per person in 2013. The U.S. government estimates that the lifetime costs of treating all medical expenses will exceed $1 trillion.[1][2] In 2010, Medicare paid for $7.8 billion of health care services provided by doctors and hospitals.[3] Physicians are also responsible for more than three-quarters of healthcare expenditures.[4] In addition to paying for their own personal medical treatment, physicians often receive payment from insurance companies to perform procedures like hip replacements, knee replacement surgeries, cancer chemotherapy treatments, and dental work. Physicians and other healthcare providers can earn hundreds of thousands of dollars annually through fees for procedures and treatments they provide.[5][6] It is estimated that, on average, an office visit with a physician costs more than $100, but patients pay only about 10 percent of those costs.[6] Although many people believe that health insurance protects them against financial hardship due to unexpected medical bills, few people know how much money insurers actually reimburse doctors who treat certain conditions, including those related to chronic diseases.[7] This means that for every dollar Americans spend on health insurance premiums each year, roughly one-fifth goes toward medical expenses that are not covered by employer-sponsored coverage.[7] According to the Kaiser Family Foundation,","Chronic diseases include conditions such as heart disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, osteoporosis, Parkinson's disease and other neurological or metabolic disorders. They are a major cause of disability and death in both developed and developing countries and they tend to be more prevalent among older people (age 45-59).

The United States is home to nearly 30 million individuals living with one or more of these chronic diseases; this represents about 9 percent of all adults and 15 percent of the population. Most of them live in rural areas where access to care is limited. According to a 2006 study published by the journal Diabetes Care, patients with a current diagnosis of type 2 diabetes had difficulty meeting their health care costs even when taking into account direct medical expenses, indirect costs, loss of work productivity due to illness, lost productivity due to disability and other factors related to diabetes. These expenses totaled $19 billion annually—roughly equal to the entire amount spent on prescription drugs for all Americans aged 19 and over. The burden of these costs is felt disproportionately by lower income families and low-income communities, which contribute disproportionately to overall healthcare costs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.[2]

Source: Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Office of the Chief Actuary, ""Medicare Spending in 2009,"" accessed March 7, 2010

In addition to contributing to high medical cost burdens, the economic losses associated with chronic diseases can also be significant. As shown in Figure 3, per capita annual expenditures on chronic diseases were more than twice the levels of the previous decade from 2004 to 2007. Per capita annual spending on cardiovascular disease was nearly three times higher than it was in 1989. Spending on arthritis and musculoskeletal disorders increased at an average rate of 4.9 percent each year between 1991 and 1999 but increased more than 10 percent during the period 2005 through 2008, while spending on Alzheimer's disease increased at an average rate of 6.5 percent annually. [4]

Diseases which occur with frequency are listed below.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) Alzheimer's disease occurs as a result of the accumulation of abnormal proteins within cells. As these proteins accumulate, they impair cellular functions including memory, mood, judgement and coordination. It may also cause problems with body posture, concentration and balance. There are two types of AD; early-onset and late-onset. Early onset, or milder forms appear over 30 years before dementia develops. Late-onset, or more severe forms, are seen after age 60 and occur later than in the first group. Alzheimer's disease affects approximately 5 million people worldwide. In Canada alone it will affect 4 million by 2020. This disease can be treated successfully through cognitive rehabilitation therapy and other treatments.


Cancer Cancer is the fourth leading killer behind heart disease, stroke and respiratory illness. The majority of cancer cases result from the uncontrolled growth and spread of normal cells into cancerous tissue. While many cancers are genetic, some, such as cervical, breast and prostate cancers, are caused by environmental factors such as cigarette smoke and contaminated water. Smoking causes about one third of all cancer deaths in women and 15% of deaths among men. Many cancers are prevented by being active, eating healthy foods and staying out of the sun. People at highest risk of developing some types of cancer include those who regularly consume alcohol, use tobacco products, who were exposed to carcinogens in the workplace and/or during childhood, who are not physically active and have diabetes or high blood pressure. A number of lifestyle choices can increase your cancer risk by increasing your exposure to carcinogens, and so reducing your ability to reduce your cancer risk in the future. The five main risks are tobacco smoking, regular alcohol consumption (defined as 2 drinks per day or more), diet, physical activity, and sun exposure. Each of these influences your chances of getting certain types of cancer, but each also has several beneficial aspects to consider. For example, drinking alcohol increases HDL levels - good cholesterol - while diet reduces bad cholesterol levels. Physical activity promotes strong bones and protects against osteoporosis. Sun protection helps protect skin from UV radiation and vitamin D. Both these are important for protecting you against skin cancer. You should stay active and eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruit and vegetables. Avoid processed food and processed meat as well as fried food containing high amounts of fat and salt.","Chronic illnesses include heart disease, diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, etc.

How many people have a history of any one of these disorders?

I've talked to patients who have had multiple sclerosis, who were still suffering from headaches at age 30, when they died, yet had no record of it on their death certificate. The majority of them lived into their 60s or even 70s with no known history of MS. And those that did develop MS also seem to be living longer than average, so again the incidence is increasing, but there isn't enough data to know how much longer. They could have been misdiagnosed, or could have simply died in middle age from other causes before seeking medical attention.

What about chronic pain?

There seems to be more research into pain management and opioids as treatment for chronic pain. There seems to be evidence showing that opioids may help ease pain without making symptoms worse. This could mean less use of pharmaceutical drugs, reducing opioid dependence (which is an issue), and helping reduce the number of overdose deaths by keeping addicts off heroin. Some researchers believe opioids could help prevent and treat the spread of HIV/AIDS. But this study shows just how little we really understand about the role of opioids in causing chronic illness.

In my opinion, one big reason that we don't know the full extent of opioids' role in chronic illness is because a lot of studies have looked only at short-term use, and not long-term abuse or dependency. We need longitudinal studies in order to get at the true impact that opioids can have on health. Until then, I would recommend against using opioids for chronic illness. A better choice would probably be to avoid all prescription medications altogether, except perhaps if you have severe allergies to food, water, or certain ingredients like coffee. Or for occasional use of opioids such as some forms of asthma medication.

Are you involved in any clinical trials investigating cannabinoids/cannabinoids for treating or preventing chronic illness? If so, can you please describe your involvement in these studies?

My involvement in cannabinoid research has primarily been around understanding the biochemistry behind the different endocannabinoids and the unique effects of each one. That includes studying how the body processes and metabolizes marijuana compounds and determining which ones are responsible for specific effects.

As far as clinical trials go, I'm currently working on an R&D","Chronic illnesses are those that affect one's physical, mental, or emotional health. There are many types of chronic disease. These include heart disease, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, depression, high blood pressure (hypertension), hypertension, asthma, and other respiratory disorders. The impact on people is huge because chronic diseases can lead to poor quality of life. \r

Healthier choices

Why do you think that the US spends more than $1 trillion on health care annually? Is it a simple matter of cost control or is there another reason? What would you say about the results that we see from different strategies in treating chronic diseases?\r

What are some of your thoughts on how the healthcare system should be structured? Would you prefer an ""all-or-nothing"" approach, where treatments are all available at any time or a system that allows patients to choose which treatment is right for them?

You have to understand that it's all in your head and there is no way to know what you are thinking or doing when you are exercising. You may feel great when you go running or working out, but you will end up burning more calories during the workout than you burned before. When you don't get enough sleep (or if you're a night owl), this can also happen as well. It seems like most people are not getting enough rest so they burn more calories when they exercise compared to when they do not exercise. This doesn't mean that they shouldn't train, but just make sure you are eating and sleeping well.

Answer: if someone ate less than 1000 calories per day they could be classified as calorie restricted. On the other hand, a person who eats 2000+ calories a day will not gain fat or gain muscle but instead burn more energy and become fatter! The main reason for the extreme differences in weight loss are the different effects of insulin on fat cells versus muscle cells.

Calorie Restriction / Metabolic Phase Loss


What to Eat

Eating well is key to losing weight. A good way to maintain your metabolism while cutting is to eat high quality protein such as chicken breast, turkey leg quarters, lean beef, salmon, tofu, eggs etc... You need protein every 2 hours. A great source of protein is beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, pumpkin seeds and peanut butter. Protein is also known as essential amino acids. It's found in all food but is most concentrated in animal products. In order to get enough protein it helps to consume low fat dairy products like cheese, yogurt, sour cream and milk, nuts and peanuts, and seeds like flax seed oil. Avoid foods that contain added sugar (sucrose) like candy, cookies, cakes, chips and sodas. Limit alcohol as much as possible. Also keep in mind that too many carbs in the diet at once can slow down your metabolism and cause hunger pangs.

Dietary Fats

A healthy diet is composed mainly of fatty meats like fish and meat, poultry, pork, duck, bacon, sausage, ham, lard, sausages, eggs etc.. It's important to avoid fats from unhealthy sources such as processed junk food. Fat intake is determined by the body. If your weight is stable then it means you are eating enough fat and avoiding unnecessary carbohydrates. However, if your weight fluctuates then you're likely consuming too many calories. To prevent unwanted weight gain eat a variety of foods each day including vegetables, fruits, whole grain cereals, beans, whole grains and fruits. This way you'll make sure you get sufficient vitamin D, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium and vitamins B1, B2, C, E, K, folate, niacin, pantothenic acid, choline and","Best apps daily activity exercise diabetes

22,Question: my risk for developing type 2 diabetes\nAnswer:,"i have a very high risk of this (as seen below), but i've been on medication for 6 years. if i stop taking the meds, do i get better? Answer: i think your risk is higher than normal if you don't have any other risk factors for type 2 diabetes (eg a family history) because those people should be screened at some point anyway to screen for more severe forms like prediabetes and it may be helpful in that way. i'm not sure how much you are putting in with the medications though.

question: what can i eat to help me lose weight?

answer: i recommend eating less protein (and also less fat). try to stay away from processed foods, sugar-sweetened drinks and highly refined grains. take a multivitamin or drink 2 litres of water per day, try to avoid saturated fats (like beef, butter, etc.) as they raise blood triglyceride levels more than unsaturated fats and increase insulin resistance too. low carb diets are usually a good thing so long as you limit carbohydrates. if you feel hungry after a meal then you're probably still getting too many calories. you'd need to reduce calorie intake by 500 to 1000 cals per day depending on your situation to make things easier. as well as exercising regularly to burn off extra calories, you could look into fasting (only eating during certain hours of the day, e.g. 8am - 9pm) which will help lower blood glucose levels.

question: are there any drugs available to treat type 2 diabetes?

answer: no one knows exactly why some people develop type 2 diabetes while others don't. most likely it has something to do with genetics and environmental factors, including diet and lifestyle choices. there's currently no drug known to work against type 2 diabetes or even prevent it, although the possibility remains that some drugs that might inhibit platelet aggregation will someday prove effective. the first drug approved for treating type 2 diabetes was glipizide, which is a proton pump inhibitor which works by inhibiting an enzyme called PPARγ. PPARγ plays a central role in energy metabolism, so lowering its activity can lead to significant improvements in body weight and blood pressure. another drug (dabrafenib) is used to treat the side effects associated with insulin, such as frequent urination, thirst and constipation. darunavir, which is in development to target TNFα, is thought to have similar effects to insulin itself in reducing inflammation in the",a very low one!,"Factors that could affect your chances of becoming diabetic include: being overweight or obese; having high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and/or other heart-related conditions such as high blood sugar. A higher body mass index (BMI) is also linked to a greater probability of developing Type 2 diabetes than any other risk factor (Kraemer et al., 2003).

In contrast to the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes in the general population, there are marked differences between individuals who have been diagnosed with the disease compared with those who do not (Hendrickson, 2007). In addition to risk factors already mentioned, a history of smoking may increase your chance of developing the condition (Perez et al., 2004).

As a result of these factors, many people develop Type 2 diabetes during their lifetime. Among adults aged 30–49 years, approximately 5% will become prediabetic by age 75 years, whereas among children and adolescents aged 12–19 years, the figure rises to 14%. The incidence of type 2 diabetes can be expected to rise in this age group due to increased consumption of sugary beverages, a possible link between obesity and type 2 diabetes, and an overall aging society (Larsen, 2009).","if I'm not careful, i could get it.

I recently had a friend tell me she has been diagnosed with Type-2 Diabetes and that's why her hair turned yellowish brown. She told me the doctor said that if they don't do something quickly, her blood sugar will start to drop below normal levels which could lead to permanent damage of the pancreas. Any advice on what can be done?

Post 5 My name is Michelle and I have just started the first year of high school. As soon as my son was born, he began getting headaches, vomiting and diarrhea, I did not know at the time but we were dealing with Hashimoto thyroiditis (a form of autoimmune disease). Since then my body went through a lot of changes. While the symptoms are different each time, I am still seeing all of these new symptoms that I never saw before. The worst symptom is having trouble swallowing food because of the constant pain in my throat and jaw. Another symptom I experience is being unable to sleep, sometimes waking up several times throughout the night, while some nights I only sleep 4 hours or less. I think the pain from the migraines is also affecting this, since when you're tired, your brain doesn't really work as well. It seems like every time I take two aspirin and relax, there is another headache coming out. I have seen a psychiatrist about a month ago and am starting to see results now. We're slowly beginning to heal from the initial problems, but it takes time. It is hard to explain how much of an effect medication has on your body, but it seems that a lot of the issues have something to do with serotonin. It seems that taking more than one pill per day may cause depression and anxiety in certain people. This would be very rare though and I believe most people will be fine without multiple pills per day. I'm hoping that I'll be able to finish high school and continue my education. view entire post

Post 3 @anon121691 - I had Hashimoto's at age 26 and now I have an advanced form. I also have been treated with Metformin. This helped, but was not enough. My weight dropped dramatically. In addition, after six months of treatment I gained 10 pounds. When I checked my weight again after three weeks, it was back down to where it was before I took metformin. Now I'm thinking I may need surgery. I've asked for","the number of other people who are diabetic is likely to be higher than your risk. The number of others you meet with each day will also increase your chances of becoming diabetic.

Question: my blood glucose levels have been steadily rising over a period of about two years. Do I need medication? Answer: You do not need to take insulin or any other medications because your high blood sugar has been caused by lifestyle and food choices that include: smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, stress, alcohol use, lack of exercise and diet low in fruit and vegetables. Taking insulin will help control this type of high blood sugar, but it is not necessary. If you continue to develop high blood sugars, then you should see an endocrinologist (a doctor trained in hormones) who can prescribe medications, such as metformin (Glucophage, Novolog) to decrease blood sugar.","if I was to eat less than 2000 calories a day.

*The American Diabetes Association recommends that you limit your daily calorie intake to less than 1800 calories per day.*

You can also reduce the amount of carbohydrates in your diet by choosing foods with low glycemic index, which are high in fiber and have very little or no sugar. Examples include beans, whole grains (such as quinoa), applesauce and oatmeal.*","""My risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes is approximately 10% (approximately two-thirds to three-quarters)"".

So you have a 15% chance of having the condition.

Now, this is only based on your risk factors at that time, and there are other variables which affect your chances, such as if you are overweight or underweight; how much exercise you do or not do; whether you have high cholesterol; your lifestyle habits (smoking, diet). Also, there are genetic conditions (such as Glycaemic Index, Lipid Profiles etc.) which may affect your risk even more so than those mentioned above. The fact remains though, that it's highly unlikely that your risk will increase by more than 10%.

Your risk decreases with age though, and if you're over 65 or just getting older, then you might want to take note of your health. Your doctor can provide you with some statistics about your current health and what could be causing any changes in your risk factor levels.","yes, although not as high as those who don't smoke.

Question: How much sugar is too much? Answer: There is no safe level of consumption of sugars or refined carbohydrates.

Question: What are the health risks of eating processed foods? Answer: they cause a variety of diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).


Frequent exercise can reduce your risk for heart disease by 20%. Smoking reduces it to 9%!


The US Heart Association recommends that you eat two servings of fruits and vegetables per day. That's 1 cup of whole fruit and 4 ounces of dried fruit each day, both from fresh fruit. Eat one serving of dairy each day or less than half an ounce of cheese, yogurt, ice cream, butter or other dairy products. The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics says that saturated fats have been shown to raise cholesterol levels in some people. In general, there is more evidence of harm associated with red meat and processed meats than fat from plant sources. The only exception seems to be omega-3 fatty acids, which may prevent sudden cardiac death and other symptoms related to atherosclerosis. However, most studies seem to support the idea that these beneficial compounds make up part of our overall intake rather than playing a major role. Also note that even though vegetable oils have high concentrations of unsaturated fats, because we often use them as salad dressings or cooking oil, their total amount of unsaturated fats is quite small compared with the amounts of saturated fats we consume. So when choosing healthy fats, think about choosing healthy vegetable oils. To read more about saturated fat please click here.

How Do We Get High Cholesterol? There are two ways that we can get cholesterol:

Our bodies make cholesterol when we absorb food containing cholesterol. Our liver makes this cholesterol in response to eating foods containing cholesterol.

In each case, the cholesterol gets into our blood vessels and tissues where it accumulates in our cells, including the walls of our arteries.

This accumulation occurs as our cholesterol levels rise. If the level rises too quickly, however, we experience the symptoms of hypercholesterolemia and heart disease—like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, swollen hearts and arteries and hardening of the arteries.

The Causes of High Cholesterol Levels

Cholesterol is made by the body when we ingest foods rich in cholesterol. When these foods enter our system, some of the cholesterol passes through our intestines and ends up inside the fat cells located there","your risk of developing type 2 diabetes is equal to the risk of any other woman at her age, irrespective of whether she has a high-risk family history of diabetes or not.

The Risks of Being Overweight and Obese in Australia

People with obesity are more likely to develop conditions like heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain cancers than people who aren't obese. This means that being overweight and/or obese puts you at higher risk of these diseases than if you were normal weight. So, it's important to be aware of how many kilos (kg) you're carrying around, so you can take steps to lose weight if necessary. There are also some health risks associated with overfatness such as sleep apnea and osteoarthritis of the knees, hip and spine. Read on to find out what to do about these health issues and how much extra care you need when exercising.


How Do I Know If I'm Overweight?

If you weigh yourself regularly, you'll notice that your body mass index (BMI), which measures the amount of fat (in kilograms per metre squared) on your body compared to height (metres tall), will vary from time to time. Your BMI may range between 25 and 30; however, most women who have an excess amount of belly fat (the 'belly' or abdominal area) will have a BMI greater than 30. Women who carry extra pounds around their waist may also have a BMI lower than 25 because they might have some muscle on their upper arms and legs, which gives them a slightly wider waistline but less of a bulge around the middle (abdomen). Having a healthy BMI makes your body feel better, reduces the chance of developing cancer, helps control blood pressure, cholesterol and triglycerides, improves blood flow throughout the body, keeps you feeling full longer, reduces the risk of falls and strokes, protects against cardiovascular disease and can even help reduce the chances of getting Type 2 diabetes.


What Are Some Signs That I Could Be Overweight?

Being overweight or obese increases your risk of developing many of the same conditions as those already linked to being underweight – including:

Heart disease: The higher your BMI, the greater your risk of having heart disease. It's estimated that one third of all deaths among Australians in 2011 related to heart disease. And although researchers don't yet know exactly why this is the case, research suggests a number of factors, including increased levels of saturated fat in our diet"
35,Question: Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?\nAnswer:,"Yes, and it can be very helpful.

What is the best form of low carb?

Question: I'm going to start doing my own research on this issue, so that's why I asked you in the first place. What are some good forms of low-carb for people who want to lose weight and improve their health?

Answer: I would say most diets out there at least offer some type of carbohydrate restriction (low carbs or moderate) or protein restriction (high protein). That being said, a low-carb diet does not have to include high protein or high fat because they often do NOT help one lose weight more than other types of diets. However, if you're trying to reduce your insulin level as much as possible without going into diabetic coma then having a significant amount of higher quality fats or carbohydrates may prove beneficial. This is mainly due to insulin signaling not working properly when these nutrients are ingested because of the increased appetite associated with them (more calories consumed than burned), which leads to a drop in blood sugar levels. Therefore, if you eat enough quality proteins and sufficient amounts of healthy fats along with a few cups of vegetables every day, you should see a huge reduction in your blood sugars, decrease in hunger and feel better about yourself overall!

How do I know if I am eating enough fiber?

Question: If I cut out all processed food and have no added sugar, what kind of fiber will I get from foods like oatmeal or quinoa?

Answer: Fiber, which is made up of complex molecules like cellulose and lignin, promotes satiety by slowing down digestion, helping slow down the absorption of glucose and helps stabilize blood sugar levels. So, when you combine fiber with nutritious, filling meals, you'll find that you can enjoy plenty of fullness throughout the day instead of feeling hungry throughout. For example, oats contain 30 grams of dietary fiber per cup and 15 grams of fiber in each 1/4 cup serving – that means that one cup contains 10 percent of your daily recommended intake. Of course, oat bran (powdered oats) has only 0.5 gram of fiber per serving. Quinoa also has 8 grams of fiber per teaspoon.

The two main sources of fiber in our bodies are fruits and vegetables, but both are extremely low in fiber compared to whole grains. The good news is that we don't need any extra fiber to maintain a healthy gut, as long as we're getting the proper nutrition. Some studies show","Yes, it is. This is because ketosis – the state of being at or near a low carb intake – is an optimal condition for a person with type 1 and 2 diabetes who wants to lose weight. There are two main methods which we will discuss in this guide: intermittent fasting and modified Fast Dieting (this latter technique is called Modified Atkins).

Why Use Ketosis?

There are several reasons why a person would want to use ketosis as their preferred nutritional strategy for losing weight. The first reason is that a ketotic state improves insulin sensitivity. In other words, a ketogenic state causes your body to produce less glucose and more fat. As you can see from our list above, a high-carbohydrate diet actually helps your body burn fat and glycogen and maintain blood sugar levels. If you are on a high carbohydrate diet, then a low-fat diet may work better for you. However, if you have Type 2 Diabetes, reducing carbs does not automatically mean reducing calories; in fact, studies show that even very low calorie diets can help reduce triglycerides! It's important to understand that a ketogenic diet reduces inflammation and promotes healthy heart function. In short, ketones are great for your health.

The second reason to use ketosis is that ketosis allows us to burn more fat than we consume and thus improve metabolic flexibility. While some people need to eat very little fat in order to maintain a stable weight while trying to lose weight, others don't have to do anything special. People with Type 1 Diabetes often struggle to achieve weight loss because they have difficulty burning fat due to insulin resistance (the result of having too much insulin circulating in your bloodstream). When you remove insulin from the equation, your body burns energy for fuel instead of storing fat. This makes it easier for you to get leaner through exercise or by simply changing your diet to one rich in low-glycemic carbohydrates. And, yes, you can still enjoy the benefits of a low-carb diet without using the techniques outlined below!

It is important to note though that there are certain foods you should avoid when you try to eat to your ideal body composition. For example, nuts and seeds (which contain large amounts of phytic acid) are especially bad for someone with Type 1 Diabetes. Also, eating lots of eggs or dairy products (even cottage cheese!) decreases fat oxidation (i.e., fat burning) by 30% and increases dietary protein synthesis (a process involving breaking down protein into amino acids), so this","Yes, especially if you can manage your blood glucose levels well on the low carb plan. You may need to use some type of medication to help control your blood sugar; however, you should not have any problems with this using either the Atkins or Ketogenic diets.

2. Can I eat too much protein?\nAnswer: The amount of protein that is recommended by both the Atkins and Ketogenic diets varies depending upon body weight, gender, activity level, etc., so it's best not to go over this range unless you are already extremely obese, in which case you probably shouldn't be eating that much at all anyway.

3. Is there anything wrong with eating too much fat?\nAnswer: No. Both the Atkins and Ketogenic diets encourage a high-fat/low carbohydrate diet, but as long as you avoid excess saturated fats, trans fats, omega 6 fatty acids, and refined carbs (i.e. white flour, white rice, etc.), and limit refined sugar consumption, your cholesterol levels will remain normal.","Yes! Ketones, by definition are the body's preferred fuel source. A diet that is high in fat and low in carbohydrates stimulates the production of ketone bodies. These fatty acids can be broken down by your liver into usable sugar (glucose). This means you don't have to worry about your blood glucose levels falling below normal or getting stuck at dangerous levels as you work towards reaching an ideal weight. People who are diabetic need to control their blood sugars because it sets them up to develop type 2 diabetes. If you start using ketosis (burning fat instead of carbs) early enough then you can avoid developing type 2 diabetes. The following picture shows what happens when your body burns fat instead of carbohydrates.

What do I do if I am not ready to use ketosis?

If you haven't used ketosis yet then the best thing to do is take one meal a day during your transition period and gradually increase the number of meals. After starting a low carb, ketogenic diet (or any other low calorie diet) you should always aim to keep your carbohydrate intake below 50g per day (5oz). You will be able to start burning fat much more easily once you get rid of all those pesky cravings. However, there is also no reason why you shouldn't try to reduce your carbohydrate intake even further so that you are around 50-60g per day (4.8 – 5oz). This will help to decrease the amount of carbohydrate being stored as glycogen. Remember too that you still want to limit protein consumption during this time, although you may be tempted to eat a little more meat, fish or dairy products.

How long does it usually take me to reach my goal weight after starting a ketogenic diet?

This varies from person to person but typically starts off within 3 weeks. However, you can often lose a lot of weight without having started a very restrictive diet and so you could see results sooner.

Can I follow a low carb diet long term?

Yes! Although most people find that they need to make some adjustments along the way. A recent study found that someone on a strict low carb diet has lost 14 pounds after 9 months which was amazing! It would seem that your insulin sensitivity improves significantly while losing weight. There are also many studies showing that once you achieve ketosis, you are less likely to crave sweets.

Is there anything else I should know before I start keto?

I know that a lot of people ask themselves 'is","Yes, in principle. However, a low carb, high fat (LCHF) diet is preferred by most diabetics who are concerned about their blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity.


A keto-adapted approach should be sufficient to prevent complications such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It can also improve health-related quality of life. The effects of the diet have been well documented in several studies on humans and animals. One key study was carried out on rats that were fed either a LCHF diet or a normal diet. Their bodies began to burn more glucose from foods when they switched from an ordinary carbohydrate-rich diet to a ketogenic one, resulting in a reduction in body weight. This was accompanied by changes in biochemical markers which indicate improved metabolic health. In other words, the rats' health conditions took on new characteristics associated with the ketogenic state. Another recent study conducted on human volunteers showed that the ketone ester fatty acids produced during the conversion process could increase mitochondrial biogenesis and reduce inflammation. Some of this evidence suggests that low carbohydrates may have beneficial effects on human metabolism.","Yes! If you are diabetic, then a ketogenic / keto diet is the best choice. It works great and can help you lose weight and keep your blood sugar levels stable while giving you all the benefits of a healthy low-carbohydrate diet without any of the harmful side effects associated with traditional diabetes diets.

Q&A on Carbohydrates and Diabetes \nQuestion: What about carbohydrates in my carb-rich foods such as candy bars and sweets? Can I eat those foods? Answer: You may be able to eat sugar free or reduced calorie candies but most candies contain carbohydrate and some have added sugar. In general, it is best not to consume high amounts of glucose in excess of 100 grams per day (100 g = approximately 6 oz.). This will increase insulin sensitivity, which increases the risk of diabetes. For more information, please visit our page on dietary guidelines for diabetics. Q&A on Carbohydrates and Diabetes Q&A with Dr. Robert Lustig, MD Question: My doctor suggested that I reduce my daily carbs from 45 grams to 25 grams after eating pizza at a restaurant recently. However, when I ate the same amount of pizza the next night I had no problems getting full afterwards. Should this advice apply to everyone who eats pizza regularly? Answer: The lower you go with your carbohydrate intake the better it will work. You should try to find ways to get less than 35 grams of carbohydrate on any given day - usually eaten between lunch and dinner. Keep in mind that every time you take one bite of your favorite food, you are also taking away another bite. To minimize calories, always choose lean meats, vegetables, nuts, seeds, avocado, and whole grains. Q&A on Carbohydrates and Diabetes

FAQs and other resources","There is good evidence that the ketogenic diet can be safely used to treat type 2 diabetes. However, it is important to note that there are many other factors involved in managing your diabetes.

A Ketogenic Diet Helps Lower Blood Sugar & Blood Pressure, but Should Be Used With Caution\u2019s Answer

The ketogenic diet has become widely accepted as an effective treatment for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. But this diet should not be undertaken without consulting your doctor, as some of its side effects are serious enough to warrant hospitalization. You may also need to follow a low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LCHF) diet as part of any treatment program. In addition, you will need to make lifestyle changes such as changing your eating habits, exercising more frequently, and avoiding alcohol.1 As long as these dietary changes are kept up, you may be able to manage your diabetes on a ketogenic diet.2

Ketosis in Type 1 Diabetes

In most cases, when people take medications for their diabetes, they usually have a fasting blood sugar level greater than 70 mg/dL. When people use the ketogenic diet, however, they typically have lower blood sugars at first—but then fall back down after about 6 months.3 This is because the body adjusts by reducing insulin production, which results in a rapid drop in blood sugar levels.4

Even though ketones don't get stored as fat, this means that people on a ketogenic diet generally lose weight during their fasting period.5 Although weight loss isn't always desirable, losing too much weight could cause health problems such as kidney stones or heart disease.6

How Ketone Bodies Help Control Tiredness \u2014 Why They're Important \u2014 How to Use Them

People who have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes often experience tiredness, but there's no clear explanation as to why this happens. One study suggests that fatigue is caused by glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, and that using supplemental protein can help to alleviate these symptoms.7

Another theory is that the presence of ketone bodies in the bloodstream provides a source of energy.8 A recent review article suggested that ketones might be particularly beneficial for treating chronic fatigue syndrome.9 Because the liver produces ketones for fuel, people with diabetes are less likely to develop fatty liver diseases or cirrhosis.10

What Can Be Done With Keto?

Although ketogenic diets can help manage diabetes, they aren't","A ketogenic diet is not appropriate for people with diabetes. Ketosis, which is the state in which your body burns fat as its main source of fuel, can lead to dangerous complications if you are insulin resistant and have type 2 diabetes (i.e., your pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin). It has also been shown that there are more risks associated with low-carb diets than with higher carb diets, especially when it comes to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, consuming very large amounts of carbohydrate will actually impair insulin sensitivity even further; this means that if you consume too many carbohydrates during a high-fat/low-protein/moderate-calorie diet, you'll actually experience greater fluctuations in blood sugar. The bottom line is that you should definitely consider having someone with diabetes monitor your glucose levels, because you may need extra help or support in these situations. As always, check with your healthcare provider before making any dietary changes.

What the Experts Say

The following are comments from physicians and other health care providers on how they use this type of diet to treat or manage patients. These doctors have been asked to write about their experience with this type of diet because it's one of the most frequently requested treatments by those who are trying to improve their condition.

Dr. Richard J. Johnson, MD. ""Ketosis may be more effective than medication for controlling blood sugar levels in some persons."" (Johnson et al., 2005)

""A high-fat/low-carbohydrate diet can induce insulin resistance, which in turn causes hyperglycemia,"" said Dr. Richard J. Johnson, Medical Director of the Center for Diabetes Research at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. He explained that if individuals were unable to control blood glucose levels through regular medication, then using an alternative approach such as this low carbohydrate diet could provide a successful means of achieving weight loss and lowering blood glucose. (Heide, 2004; Johnson & Hoehn, 2009)

Dr. Mary Pappas, DNP, RDN. ""Many people have very high cholesterol levels, but there also seem to be less heart disease cases among those with normal cholesterol levels and higher fasting insulin levels. Low-glycemic index foods help people regulate their blood sugars better than high glycemic load foods. A well-designed low-carbohydrate diet is generally safe and helps reduce the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease,"" she told Medscape Medical News.

Dr. Susanne Romm, PhD, RHC. This nutritionist at the University of California, San Francisco agrees. ""People with diabetes should try a ketogenic diet first before attempting any treatment involving medications. I recommend starting with a relatively moderate amount of carbohydrates like breads and pastries. Then add more slowly into the meal. The goal is to maintain a constant level of carbs, with no spikes. In addition, the body will respond faster to lower carb meals and will produce less insulin. The net effect is rapid weight loss and improved blood sugar control.""

Dr. Kevin Hall, ND, FACC. When he was working with obese children, he often found that when he started them off on a very low-calorie diet, they lost much more weight and felt healthier. ""This diet allowed us to keep their calorie intake low while having a positive impact on their metabolic health—and they maintained the weight loss despite having significant food cravings,"" said Dr.","Yes, it can help you achieve and maintain blood glucose control. You should avoid high-glycemic foods (such as white bread or sugar) while following a low-carbohydrate/low-fat diet in order to decrease the risk of developing ketosis (the state in which your body breaks down fat).

Ketones are produced by your liver when carbohydrates become unavailable due to increased insulin resistance and/or inadequate amounts being consumed via diet. This is why ketones may be a useful marker of energy deficiency and/or insulin resistance in the presence of type 1 diabetes. While these biomarkers were originally discovered to help diagnose diabetic ketoacidosis, they are now equally useful in predicting glucose levels after an oral glucose tolerance test.

The bottom line:

If you have diabetes but don't know whether you have hyperglycemia, then a low carb / no carb diet seems like the best option. If you do have diabetes, however, I would recommend that you go on a strict ketogenic diet in order to lower glucose output and thus prevent ketoacidosis from occurring.

In addition to lowering overall glycaemic and insulin levels, this dietary approach also has the added benefit of helping you drop weight through a reduction in appetite and food cravings. In contrast, an unhealthy low calorie diet usually leads to increased calories eaten per day over time, leading to weight gain. By limiting carbohydrate intake, you will likely feel better, even if you don't lose weight.

What about losing weight? How does a ketogenic diet affect my metabolism?

A low carb / no carb diet won't cause rapid weight loss because it doesn't reduce insulin secretion. However, it will dramatically improve metabolic health by reducing the production of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby preventing oxidative damage associated with obesity. Also, since ketones are generated during exercise and not stored as fat, they actually contribute to a reduction in total caloric expenditure.

So what's the catch?

It's important to understand that there are two major caveats to using a ketogenic diet for weight loss. First, the optimal amount of fat needed to get into ketosis depends upon your genetic makeup and body composition. Second, maintaining sufficient physical activity to support brain function during the fasting phase could lead to a slight increase in metabolic rate during ketosis compared to eating normally. It therefore isn't recommended for obese individuals, as long as any significant improvements in metabolic health are maintained throughout the fasted period."
45,Question: Can diabetes be cured?\nAnswer:,"No. The cause of type 2 diabetes is the body's response to a chronic, life-threatening infection known as insulin resistance. There are no known ways to cure insulin resistance.

The following are some possible treatments for type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Type 1 Diabetes Treatment Options

People with type 1 diabetes may need to have their blood sugar levels monitored periodically or they may need medication. This includes taking insulin injections every four hours. In addition, it is not uncommon for people who have Type 1 diabetes to need insulin replacement therapy (insulin pump). Insulin pumps take your insulin from your body through an IV bag that delivers insulin directly into your muscles. They can help keep blood glucose in control at all times so you don't get too hungry during meals.

If someone has type 1 diabetes, there are certain steps that must be taken before receiving treatment. These include:","Yes, with proper care and monitoring.\r

\t\tThe best way to prevent type 2 diabetes is through good diet, regular exercise and a balanced lifestyle, including adequate sleep. \r

\t\tDiabetes can be prevented by managing blood glucose levels, which are controlled by controlling food intake, body weight and physical activity.\r

\t\tSome people may have more than one form of the disease but only one or a few types are responsible for most cases.\r

\r

1. How many types of diabetes are there?\r

There are three main types of diabetes:\r

Type 1 Diabetes (also known as Juvenile Diabetes) is a genetic disorder that results in rapid development of adult-onset symptoms, such as increased thirst and urination, rapid weight gain and early puberty. Type 2 diabetes occurs when either the insulin needed to control blood sugar level (called insulin) does not work properly or it works too well, resulting in hyperglycemia or high blood sugar levels. It also causes damage to the pancreas and other organs. Approximately 75% of all adults with type 2 diabetes will develop cardiovascular problems over their lifetime.\r

2. What causes type 2 diabetes?\r

In general, diabetes develops due to lack of insulin production by beta cells located within the endocrine system, specifically, the islets of Langerhans found within the pancreas. This is often referred to as ""insulin resistance"". Insulin helps control blood sugar levels by stimulating the breakdown of stored carbohydrates into sugars called glycogen. When there isn't enough insulin being produced, fat cells begin to store excess energy in fatty acids instead of glucose. Eventually, these stores become so large they eventually burn up their contents, causing a state of ""starvation ketosis"" that leads to hypoglycemia.\r

3. Which nutrients affect type 2 diabetes?\r

Foods high in protein increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes by increasing insulin secretion. High carbohydrate diets tend to decrease insulin release and lead to an increase in blood sugar levels without having any nutritional benefit.\r

4. Are there certain foods you should avoid?\r

High-protein, low carbohydrate diets that include red meat and processed meats, dairy products, sweets and sugary drinks, and alcohol are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.\r

5. Will","Yes, but it will take a lot of time and careful management.\r

\r

""The number one reason that people with type 1 diabetes don't respond to insulin is that they don't produce enough insulin,"" says Dr. Paul Offit, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at Children's Hospital Boston. \r

\r

In fact, if you have insulin resistance, your body has no way of sensing when there's an insulin shortage (and therefore no way to increase production). ""So when you're in a state of obesity or diabetes that doesn't improve even though you diet and exercise, then there are other underlying issues that need to be addressed."" Insulin resistance can occur in two different ways:\u2014either because the pancreas produces too little insulin or because the cells inside the pancreas lack sufficient receptors for insulin. Both factors make diabetics more likely to develop complications such as heart disease and kidney failure. The key to reversing these complications is increasing levels of insulin. To do this, you must either increase the amount of insulin produced by your liver, kidneys, muscles, or both. This requires a continual supply of insulin from your bloodstream, so you'll need to keep taking it. You also need to watch out for sugar cravings caused by carbohydrate-rich foods and beverages. If you crave sweets after meals or snacks, it may indicate you've got too much fat stored on your stomach. To avoid diabetes complications, always eat plenty of fiber, fruits and vegetables, and lean protein. And if you're overweight or obese, make sure you're not consuming more than the recommended daily calorie intake. \r

If you find yourself in a diabetic crisis, you should call 911 immediately, especially if:\r

You feel lightheaded;

Your blood pressure drops suddenly; or

You experience severe pain in your arm or leg. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis can lead to coma and death. When your kidneys fail to properly filter acid produced by the urine, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being excreted. As the level of glucose in the blood rises, the brain raises its own insulin levels to maintain normal fluid balance. Eventually the process becomes harmful; if not treated promptly, it can result in permanent damage to the delicate tissues lining the inner walls of your eyes, the membranes of your mouth and nose, and even the lining of your lungs. While this condition is rare","Yes, but it requires a lot of effort and support. There are drugs that will lower blood sugar levels enough to prevent the need for insulin injections. But it is very expensive and takes years before these drugs start working well in most people. The best method right now is lifestyle change. If you exercise regularly, eat healthy foods, watch what you eat and drink (especially water), try to avoid or limit consumption of processed foods and sugars, and don't smoke, then all of those things can work together to keep your blood glucose level under control.

Q: How long does a person have to take medications for diabetes?\nAnswer: It's not unusual at all for someone with type 1 diabetes to stay on insulin until they're old enough to no longer need medication for their condition. In fact, some studies show that children who remain on insulin as kids may even outlive their parents! Some adults can have good control of their blood sugar through diet alone, which may last up to 10 years.

Q: What happens if I stop taking my medication?\nAnswer: You could die. So make sure that you continue to get your insulin injections and any other treatment that has been recommended by your doctor. If you've tried different forms of therapy without success, talk to your doctor about switching to an implantable device called a glucometer. A glucometer monitors the amount of sugars in your body — whether from food or beverages — and tells you when you should take your insulin. It is especially useful during severe hypoglycemia.

Q: Are there any side effects to keeping a close eye on your glucose level?\nAnswer: Not really. If you're overweight, taking care of your weight might help bring down the number of times per day that you have trouble controlling your blood sugar level. It might also reduce your chances of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life.

Q: When do my daily doses of insulin begin?\nAnswer: Your doctor determines exactly how much of each injection to give you every morning, so remember that this depends largely on your weight and height. Your dose starts when you first go to sleep after eating breakfast. For example, if your BMI is 25-29, the dose would start when you wake up between 6 and 7 a.m., and continue until 8 p.m. After that time period, it increases slightly every night. In other words, if you weigh 110 pounds and are 5 feet 9 inches tall, your dose would start","Yes, it can.\n

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects more than 200 million people in the United States and roughly 32 million worldwide.1\ nDisease-related complications include blindness, nerve damage, kidney failure, amputations, heart attacks, strokes, and nerve damage.2 While diabetes is not a common condition, it causes significant morbidity and mortality among individuals with type 1 or 2 diabetes.3

The American Diabetes Association defines diabetes as an autoimmune disorder characterized by insulin resistance, which occurs when cells cannot produce enough of their own glucose to meet the body's needs for energy.4 Insulin resistance leads to high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) and frequent urination and weight loss.5\ nDietary modification is necessary if you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes to prevent long-term complications.6

People with type 1 or type 2 diabetes may develop hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), but they should not go into shock because this usually happens only in patients whose blood sugars are elevated beyond normal.7 In contrast, patients who have untreated type 1 diabetes often experience hypoglycemia at some point during the day when their blood sugar level drops below 95 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L).8 The onset of hypoglycemia usually starts after meals and develops gradually over several hours.9 Hypoglycemia is commonly associated with rapid eye movements (REM) or drowsiness, which occur when blood sugar levels remain too low.10 Hypoglycemia also has been reported in elderly persons with no known underlying cause, and it is linked with other medical conditions such as stroke, peripheral vascular disease, or myocardial infarction.11 If your symptoms persist despite controlling your blood sugar levels, see your physician immediately.

Diagnosis

If you suspect you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, seek immediate care from your doctor or a health care professional. Your doctor will determine if you have diabetes, evaluate your current medications and treatment plan, order laboratory tests, and perform physical exams. Blood pressure and body mass index measurements can help identify abnormalities such as hypertension (high blood pressure), obesity, and cardiovascular risk factors.

A thorough history is crucial because many medical conditions may coexist with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.12 Certain family members may also have diabetes. These people may need regular monitoring of blood sugar levels to monitor their progress toward better control.

Treatment

There are two types of diabetes","There is no cure for type 1 diabetes, but there are treatments that can help people with the disease.

Type 2 Diabetes – What Is It and How Does it Develop? Type 2 diabetes occurs when a person's pancreas does not produce enough insulin to control blood sugar levels (blood glucose) in the body, often caused by obesity and/or eating too many carbohydrates, sugars or starches. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes include thirst, hunger, frequent urination, fatigue, weight gain, pale skin and hair color changes, nerve damage, vision changes, shortness of breath, sleep problems, increased risk of heart attack or stroke, high cholesterol, kidney failure, nerve damage, bone pain, depression, mental confusion, and loss of muscle tone. People who have this condition may experience difficulty with walking, chewing food, driving, performing physical activities such as lifting heavy objects, sitting up straight, bending, lifting objects or climbing stairs or stairs. Because of all these issues, diagnosis of type 2 diabetes requires careful monitoring from an endocrinologist, diabetes educator or other specialists, as well as regular checkups. In addition to diabetes, patients with type 2 diabetes also experience liver and kidney problems. Most doctors expect type 2 diabetes patients will need lifelong treatment to prevent future complications from the disease. Source: www.diabetes-usa.org","Yes, you can cure diabetes by diet and exercise. You cannot reverse the disease in people with type 1 or 2 diabetes because they are predisposed to it.""

In a nutshell, if you are able to control your blood sugar level you will not need insulin injections for life. The only exception would be a person who is having an acute insulin reaction (called hypoglycemia) which could lead to death. There is no way to predict when this might occur so any intervention should be done at the first sign of symptoms.

A small number of patients with type 1 diabetes have been successfully treated using gene therapy, but most research has focused on treating adults and children with type 2 diabetes. This approach uses a patient's own cells from their pancreas that contain a modified version of the T cell receptor found in the pancreas itself. As these cells grow, they enter the body where they multiply until they reach a critical size and start producing insulin.

There are currently two main types of gene therapy, T-cell immunotherapy and targeted delivery of a virus containing the genetic material. Some studies suggest these treatments may work better than others, but none have yet proven safe enough to be used in humans without a trial.

How does it compare to standard treatment for Type 1 diabetes?

Treatment usually consists of daily insulin injections and daily glucose monitoring. It also includes lifestyle changes such as reducing stress, exercising more and eating less sugar-laden foods. If the initial results are positive then regular insulin injection can be given once every three months as necessary. However, many patients find their diabetes responds better when their treatment is started earlier rather than later and they can gradually reduce the amount of insulin injected each month.

Other treatments include oral medication to boost glucagon levels, as well as alternative medicine techniques. These therapies include acupuncture, reflexology, chiropractic care and osteopathy. They all aim to help improve blood sugar control and may take some time to show signs of success. Many patients report feeling better immediately after starting treatment.

What happens if I get a relapse of my condition?

Losing weight can prevent a diabetic flare up. Insulin injections often increase appetite and some people become overweight in order to lose excess weight.

If a person stops taking their drugs then the body needs insulin for survival. After long periods without treatment, the immune system becomes weakened so the cells start to die off, leaving them unable to produce insulin effectively again.

When we stop our treatment","No. However, we can control its symptoms.

Q: How long does it take to recover from hypoglycemia?\nAnswer: Within 3-4 hours, but this depends on the severity of hypoglycemia and your pre-existing medical condition.

Q: What is the best treatment for type 1 diabetes?\nAnswer: Treatment consists mainly of insulin injections. Other medications such as sulfonylureas (glucotrol), metformin, glucagon, folic acid, cholestyramine are also used in combination with insulin injections to increase blood glucose levels by improving insulin sensitivity. The effectiveness of these treatments depend on several factors including the age at onset and extent of insulin resistance.

Q: Is there a difference between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes? \nAnswer: There is no difference in the complications associated with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

Q: Can I lose weight if I have type 1 diabetes? \nAnswer: You cannot lose weight if you do not have diabetes. Your body needs carbohydrate for energy, and carbohydrates in the form of glucose are stored in cells in your liver. When these cells become deficient in glycogen, they begin using fat instead. This creates a state called ketosis which results in high blood sugar levels and often also seizures, weakness and fatigue. Therefore, losing 5kg of weight will improve your health by preventing severe diabetic ketoacidosis.","Yes, it can. But not without a major effort to change our lifestyle.

Diabetes is like cancer in that it takes many different factors to cause it. The good news is that there are several things we can do to slow the progression of this disease. You may have heard this before but I'm going to repeat it because I think everyone needs to know it. If you continue on your current diet and exercise routine for more than 2 years (and even longer), then you will likely improve. What does improve depends upon how quickly you address the underlying causes of the condition. It's very important to start with a clean slate when considering these changes because the old habits won't go away as easily as they used to.

The most common reason people stop doing what works for them is because their current lifestyle doesn't work anymore or it no longer suits the body type that causes the disease to develop. So before making any significant changes, determine if what you currently eat/exercise is working for you. One way to do so would be to measure insulin levels after changing your eating habits and exercise patterns. Another way is by doing something like the following:

1) Have an IV line inserted into one of the main blood vessels in the body for 3 weeks. Measure your fasting blood sugar at least every day during this time. Monitor for side effects such as headaches or dizziness. A drop in blood sugar occurs around 90 minutes after meals; this may take up to 24 hours to occur.

2) Take 10 grams of insulin once daily for three days. Insulin is stored in storage sites throughout the body in fat cells which are the fastest growing organ system. This means that if you're overweight or obese, you need to lose weight or at least stay close to the recommended 25% calorie restriction. Make sure to use pure glucose rather than dextrose or maltodextrin, since dextrose has additives added to make it appear healthier. Your doctor can prescribe 100-200 mcg of glucomannan per day. This should provide sufficient insulin for 3 months, depending upon age and medical history.

3) Increase caloric intake 50-100% over the baseline by increasing total calories, carbohydrates, protein, fats and/or adding extra fruit, vegetables and whole grains.

4) Change your exercise program and activity level. Choose activities that offer the greatest physical challenge with minimal recovery time. These include swimming laps, walking briskly, stair climbing and jogging. Exercise should be done","Yes. A cure for diabetes is still a long way off, but it's not impossible either. This disease causes the body to rely on sugar as its main source of energy; therefore, if you don't control your blood glucose levels by controlling your food and drink intake, you will eventually run out of it.

Is diabetes contagious? It depends on who gets it and how quickly they do, and this usually depends on genetics. If one person has Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes, their children are more likely than other people to have it themselves. However, there isn't any reason that anyone should get the condition unless they are genetically predisposed to getting it. The best prevention would be to monitor your own blood glucose level carefully. You can find out more about how to test yourself on our page on testing your blood glucose level.


What does having Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes mean?

If you have a diagnosis of type-1 or type-2 diabetes, you need insulin injections every three hours to keep your blood glucose levels in check. These injections contain insulin (the hormone that regulates the amount of sugar in the bloodstream) and sometimes beta cells from the pancreas that release the medication into your bloodstream. Your doctor may also recommend regular physical activity to help regulate your blood glucose levels. Other things that you can try include eating less sugary foods and drinking fewer alcoholic beverages."
51,Question: What is holistic medicine and what does it include?\nAnswer:,"""The term 'holistic' has been used as a way to refer to any kind of treatment that includes elements of both conventional medical care and alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, chiropractic therapy, naturopathic treatments, osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM), homeopathy, therapeutic massage, tai chi or Qi Gong.""

What does holistic mean in this context?

Harmony is the balance between two opposing forces.

In other words, there are two sides to every equation. One side works towards healing while the other side seeks to harm. This can be seen in our lives when we work toward balancing something like love with anger, money with anxiety, or life with fear. The more balanced you make these forces to be, the better off you will be. If you have too much of one force, you'll end up with an imbalance.

So how do we reconcile these opposites? It's all about balance. That balance allows us to live a full and meaningful life while also being able to function effectively under stressful conditions. But balance isn't easy to find; it takes practice.

According to the author, a well balanced diet should contain all of the nutrients required for good health including vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, C, D, E, folic acid, thiamine and riboflavin. This will help you meet your vitamin and mineral requirements while reducing inflammation and supporting optimal health of the immune system. \n

How does it work?\nIn the case of this dietary program, the body uses natural anti-inflammatories from foods such as: flaxseed, chia seeds, pumpkin seed, walnuts, omega 3 fatty acids (ALA), fish oil, garlic and turmeric, and also supports other essential enzymes that are involved with proper digestion and elimination. These enzymes help break down proteins, carbohydrates, fats and connective tissues into smaller components needed by the cells which have to go through the digestive process; otherwise there can be an accumulation of waste material.\n

Why do I need to use this type of nutritional supplementation?\nWell known deficiencies or conditions associated with chronic illness include chronic fatigue syndrome, allergies, thyroid problems, inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis. Inflammation and oxidative stress is believed to contribute to these disorders but the source of the damage remains unknown. Anti-inflammatory supplements have been shown to reduce the symptoms of many diseases such as multiple sclerosis and even diabetes.

What are the benefits of holistic nutrition?\nHealthy eating is about more than just choosing healthy food sources. It's also important to find out what makes each food source so beneficial and incorporate those types of foods into your meals without altering your normal diets. For example, eating fruits like apples has many health benefits including preventing cancer, heart disease and stroke, helping control blood sugar levels, controlling weight, improving digestion and increasing your overall energy level. Other fruit products found to provide high antioxidant content include cranberries and blueberries. \n

When should I take my supplements?\nYour healthcare provider will recommend taking supplements at various times throughout the day depending on how you feel and what type of food you're consuming. However, it is best to consult a professional before attempting any dietary changes. Remember, the only way to know if something is working or not is to test them yourself. Also make sure to monitor your intake throughout the course of the week since this could affect your tolerance over time. To avoid any adverse effects, make sure","It includes the principles of natural healing, including meditation; dietary practices; herbal preparations (natural remedies); homeopathy; nutrition supplements; therapeutic touch; and other forms of alternative health care.\r

Richard Nierenberg of the National Cancer Institute to describe an approach to cancer care that incorporates a combination of traditional medical approaches and alternative, complementary, or integrative modalities. Examples of these modalities are naturopathic (the use of natural healing) and chiropractic (using manipulative energy). Many people who are interested in this kind of care are referred to as ""holistic doctors."" These doctors may be practitioners who practice other forms of medicine, including conventional surgery or other more conventional forms of treatment. Others work with traditional Chinese, Indian, and Ayurvedic treatments. Some specialize in a particular area such as integrative oncology, nutritional therapies, or nutritional counseling.

When referring to holistic physicians, many health insurance companies refer to them as ""integrative physicians,"" which refers to the fact that they combine conventional and nontraditional methods of treatment in their approach to treating patients. For example, in a case where a patient has undergone chemotherapy for breast cancer but wants to maintain a low-fat diet, she would likely be considered an integrative physician, rather than an alternative practitioner. However, if her doctor prescribed other kinds of treatments besides conventional chemotherapy (such as dietary changes), then she would not be classified as being ""holistic"" per se; instead, she would be called a conventional practitioner of alternative cancer care. As part of its commitment to providing coverage for all forms of medical care, most major health plans offer comprehensive benefits packages including services from both mainstream health care providers and alternative practitioners. In addition, health insurance companies often offer incentives to encourage individuals to participate in certain activities, including participating in medical research or attending clinical trials. This type of participation helps ensure that patients receive high quality care at reasonable cost. While this can make some people uneasy, it also offers protection against having to spend outlay money to purchase insurance products that aren't designed to meet your needs.","It's a broad term that includes many different approaches to health care, including homeopathy, chiropractic, meditation, acupuncture, and herbal remedies.

Q: How does the government fund this program?

A: The federal government funds most of the research work on these various programs, including studies related to homeopathy. For example, there has been research demonstrating that some forms of homeopathic remedies may help reduce symptoms of heart disease. As well, a study funded by Health Canada indicated that certain homeopathic preparations might provide short-term relief from pain caused by osteoarthritis, while others might even prevent damage to joints.

The Federal/Provincial/Territorial Government Programs

Homeopathic care is available through federally funded clinics under the National Homeopathic Health Program administered by Health Canada. Some provinces also pay for complementary practitioners' services if they offer homeopathy as part of their practice (eg Saskatchewan). These payments are generally based on the percentage of money spent on homeopathic medications in comparison with conventional drugs. Most provincial governments are not paying for homeopathic physicians who take clients out of their own system.

In addition to funding the national homeopathic health program, the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care provides support for complementary therapy providers in Ontario via the Ontario Integrative Health Association. In 2006, approximately $1.4 million was provided annually for the association ($5 million over 5 years) to promote homeopathic treatment to seniors, students at the University of Toronto and people living with HIV/AIDS.

Healthy People 2020 promotes integrated approaches to health care. By working together, Canadians will achieve greater access to quality health care options, and ensure that we continue to protect and strengthen our public systems against threats such as infectious diseases, malnutrition and obesity. Healthy People 2020 recognizes the need to improve communication about complementary therapies among health professionals, parents, consumers and policy makers. This will enable us to make more informed decisions when deciding whether we want to use complementary approaches in our daily lives. Healthy People 2020 encourages health professionals to learn more about how complementary therapy can improve patient outcomes.","In the last twenty years, more than two million people have used the term ""holistic"" to describe their healthcare. Today, we are seeing an explosion of new products that incorporate these concepts into a single solution for treating all types of problems. The focus now shifts from individual symptoms to overall health – as opposed to disease or illness in and of itself. This shift has created something of a paradigm shift, which will impact every aspect of medicine, including pharmaceuticals. When asked about holistic medicine, doctors often say that they can use any combination of drugs, vitamins, herbs, massage therapy, acupuncture, and other forms of alternative treatment with little side effects. So how do you know if your doctor is using ""holistic"" treatments? Here's how: A physician may refer to ""holistic therapies,"" which refers to a large array of complementary remedies. They may also use terms such as ""complementary and integrative medicine."" They may use the term ""integrated care"" when discussing a variety of health-care services, such as a physical or mental hospitalization; outpatient rehabilitation; home visits by a family practitioner; medical follow-up appointments; and/or medication management. They may even mention ""integrative medicine."" The goal of this section is to help you determine whether your doctor uses holistic methods, as well as the type and extent of their use.

What's in a Name? For many people who come across these terms, the term ""holistic medicine"" just comes out of nowhere, without much explanation. You might wonder where in the world did someone get the idea that they could improve their health by integrating health ideas from throughout the history of mankind. It turns out that the term ""holistic"" was not always so mysterious. Before its current definition, the word meant ""regenerating"" or ""reproducing."" Holistic Healing: A New Concept in Traditional Chinese Medicine (18th Century) According to the 18th century Chinese book The Book of Heaven and Earth, there were three main theories on healing: Yin means good, Yang meaning neutral, and Wu means evil. The first, Yang, was associated with nature, the second, Yin, with man, and the third, Wu, with demons. As Dr. Paul Siegel explains, the Yin-Yang theory explained that, unlike natural forces, the supernatural forces of heaven and earth were capable of changing a person's life, but only after certain conditions had been met. These conditions included","It's the combination of a multidisciplinary approach to your health that includes not only physical, but also mental health.

How do I know if my treatment plan will be appropriate for me?

It's best to contact a physician or other health care provider who can explain more about what holistic medicine is, how it differs from conventional medical practices, and the differences between each type of intervention. If you're uncertain or concerned about making an appointment, talk with your healthcare provider first to make sure there are no objections to your visit. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends that women over 50 consult their doctors for annual wellness exams in addition to having regular blood pressure checks, cholesterol tests and weight checks. Women of all ages should have a mammogram every two years and check their thyroid levels at least once a year. Learn more on our Breast Health page.

What is naturopathic medicine?

Naturopathic medicine was developed by Drs. David M. Cooper and Eileen F. Cooper in 1977 as a complementary alternative treatment for cancer patients with high disease-related costs. Because cancer is very difficult to cure, they wanted to create a treatment that could improve overall patient survival rates without resorting to chemotherapy. Naturopathy emphasizes self-healing and homeopathy; its practitioners believe the body is made up of trillions of living cells called ""endothelial tissue"" which needs no outside help to heal itself. This healing process occurs through the removal of toxins that cause disease such as cancerous tumors through the application of specific substances derived from plants or animals (vitamins, minerals, enzymes) applied externally or internally. These therapies are delivered through a number of treatments including herbal remedies, massage, osteopathic manipulative procedures, acupuncture, reflexology and dietary therapy. In the United States today, naturopaths perform many different types of examinations such as pap smears, colonoscopies, urinalysis, endoscopy and x-rays.

Naturopaths prescribe drugs when they can't find herbs or other natural remedies that work well enough to treat their patients' illnesses. They may use various combinations of prescription drugs together to achieve their desired results. For example, naturopaths may combine aspirin with vitamin C to reduce symptoms caused by inflammation. However, because these drugs are both powerful antioxidants, they increase the risk of developing certain cancers, so naturopaths recommend avoiding them altogether until patients have been evaluated by a physician. In some cases, naturopaths will take a drug for","The term ""holistic"" in this context means not only the elimination of disease, but also all health problems from a person's life.

Cancer is an example of an unhealthy organ or system that needs to be corrected. A healthy cancer cannot exist without being removed. Holistic medicine treats these issues at every level, beginning with the physical, ending up with your emotional and spiritual well-being.

One example of holistic healing would be the treatment of pain by using medications (anabolic steroids). These drugs have been shown to stimulate growth of the breast cells because they cause hormone release and allow them to expand their cell walls for more blood flow and nutrient uptake. This can lead to a high risk of the developing mammary gland cancer.

Another common symptom of an unhealthy body system is impotence. It has been proven that taking anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin can improve erectile function by increasing production of nitric oxide which increases blood flow into the penis and facilitates erection.

This is just one small example of how holistic medicine can help people live longer, healthier lives.","Health care provided in an integrated, whole-person approach. This approach includes a complete medical history and physical examination, evaluation of the patient's response to treatment including disease processes (including organ function), treatment options, and the use of complementary and alternative therapies (CATs) that are not currently recommended by current guidelines or government regulations. The integrated approach should be conducted as part of a comprehensive chronic illness management plan with a focus on improving health behaviors, managing stressors, maintaining fitness levels, and optimizing quality of life and overall well being.

In addition, a complete understanding of all aspects of your condition, including both acute symptoms and their underlying causes, must be achieved. There may be times when there is no one specific cause for a particular problem, such as gastrointestinal or cardiovascular problems. In these cases, the physician will consider all possibilities including those which might indicate a diagnosis of digestive disorders, or cancer, or infectious diseases. It should also be noted that some illnesses can appear at any age; therefore, if you have been experiencing fatigue since age 20, it is important that you have your condition evaluated by a healthcare professional who can make recommendations about appropriate treatments. Also, the more severe your illness, the more urgent it is that you seek immediate medical attention. A primary care provider or doctor who is experienced in diagnosing and treating chronic illnesses, however, should not be expected to provide you with an explanation regarding why this illness exists. However, they do need to have an accurate assessment of your overall health status and a thorough understanding of how the various body systems work together to support the normal functioning of each organ system.

What is holistic medicine and what does it NOT include?

It should be noted that many people confuse ""holistic"" with ""alternative."" Holistic means that the practitioner examines the entire person, from head to toe. If, for example, a chiropractor places his hand on your back while he puts pressure on your neck muscles, is the chiropractor showing you the full picture? Of course not! He only has his hands touching parts of your anatomy, but not the rest of your body. Similarly, if a naturopathic physician, for example, was to place needles through your skin into your spine, would he be teaching you the true nature of the human body? Not necessarily!

52,Question: What are the most common mental health problems? How can I prevent or manage the most common mental health problems?\nAnswer:,"There is no simple answer to this question. The problem of mental illness and its consequences for individuals, families, communities, and society has been inextricably linked to social inequality, racism, sexism, and colonialism throughout history. In the United States, the largest single source of mental illness is poverty; however, this issue is often conflated with other issues such as substance abuse, homelessness, unemployment, family dysfunction, low educational achievement, and mental disorders. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that approximately 1 in 5 people worldwide suffer from a mental disorder in any given year [1]. Mental illness affects people of all socioeconomic classes, ethnicities, religions, races/ethnicity groups, sexual orientations, ages, genders, etc. Furthermore, there exists some evidence that indicates higher rates of depression among minority populations [2–5]. For instance, an analysis of over 2 million U.S. children who were interviewed at age six revealed that African American children had a rate of 6.7 times greater odds of having depressive symptoms than white children [6]. This finding was corroborated by another study based on national surveys conducted between 1990 and 2000 that found African Americans living in poverty had more depressive symptoms at age twelve than did whites in the same community [7]. However, despite these findings, many researchers maintain that the majority of individuals affected by mental illnesses do not meet criteria for a diagnosis because of lack of adequate diagnostic tools [8–11]. It should be noted, though, that while it is estimated that there are 1 billion individuals worldwide suffering from major depression in any given year [12], this number includes only about 200,000 cases per annum within the United States [13] ( ). Open in a separate window To gain a better understanding of the relationship between social inequalities and mental health outcomes, we examined whether race/ethnicity, education, income level, and marital status modulate lifetime prevalence estimates of major depressive episodes (MDEs). We also sought to determine if differences in the prevalence of MDEs across demographic categories are explained by underlying individual-level characteristics. Finally, we explored how changes in risk factors for mental illnesses may affect overall lifetime prevalence estimates.

Each type of illness is associated with different risk factors and may require a specialized treatment approach to be successfully treated. Most people do not have any symptoms at all until they develop an illness that puts them at high risk for developing serious consequences including death (e.g., depression).

What are some indicators of mental illness?\u003c answer\u003c

Symptoms \u0026amp; Complaints Symptoms usually begin during adolescence or early adulthood. They often present as changes in mood or behavior. The presence of these symptoms does not mean that you should seek medical attention for the illness. If you experience frequent mood swings, feelings of low self worth or guilt, feeling detached from others, trouble sleeping or concentrating, being easily agitated or overly angry or depressed, or having thoughts about suicide, you may need professional help. Some common signs of mental illness include: Irritability – Feelings such as anger or hostility, difficulty controlling temper, or aggressive outbursts are typical. Distress, helplessness, hopelessness, fear, sadness, confusion, anxiety, insomnia, irritability, and frustration are also common. Depression or Suicidal Thoughts Depression and suicidal thinking are common among those who suffer from bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness). These behaviors may occur before someone has had episodes of mania or depression or when there is no clear history of prior manic-like or depressive episodes. However, anyone struggling with severe depression, suicidal ideation, or other severe psychiatric distress should speak with their physician immediately for evaluation, if possible. Menstrual Disorders Many women who take antidepressants experience worsening menstrual symptoms (i.e., irregular periods) after discontinuation of therapy. Such bleeding or spotting may be related to a chemical imbalance caused by overstimulation of the brain's natural serotonin-producing pituitary gland by estrogen. In addition, certain SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) can cause breast cancer. It is important to know that both menopausal and premenopausal women can develop amenorrhea (absence of menstruation). Amenorrhea, which typically occurs on average once every 12 years in healthy women, is not normal in patients taking antidepressants (see Boxed Warning). You should discuss your individual response with","There is no single ""most common"" mental health problem, but there are common mental health problems that occur in all groups of people. The top five problems identified by survey respondents as being among their least desirable mental health problems include: depression, anxiety, stress/anxiety, substance abuse and suicidal thoughts (Hanson et al., 2011).


What causes mental illnesses? Psychosis may be a natural consequence of some illness-related brain changes (e.g., schizophrenia) or might result from specific experiences during childhood, adolescence or adulthood (Gillberg et al., 2008; Hanson et al., 2011). Other potential causes for psychosis include early trauma, head injury, stroke, chronic drug use and severe psychological distress.


Are there treatments for mental health issues? Some interventions, such as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), stress reduction techniques and medication have been shown to help with symptoms of certain mental disorders (e.g., PTSD) (Hanson et al., 2009). Others, such as psychotherapy (including group therapies), psychodynamic treatment and pharmacological treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, substance use disorders, traumatic brain injury or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), have not been shown to provide long term benefits (Blair, 2002). In addition, the effectiveness of these interventions varies greatly depending on the specific condition being treated (Clifton, 2000; Gillberg et al., 2008).


Is it true that I need to avoid contact with people who suffer from serious mental illness? Many people assume they need to avoid social contacts and activities if they are concerned about someone's mental health. While this may be appropriate in some cases, this approach should only be applied when it is necessary for an individual. For example, if you live near an elementary school where there is a history of mental health problems within the community, you do not want to stay at home every day. However, avoiding friends and relatives of those affected by serious mental illness can make matters worse because such people tend to isolate themselves. Also, being alone makes it more difficult to seek help, which can affect quality of life.


I don't know what my mental health status means. You may have heard that having a high level of symptoms or past negative experiences indicate a higher risk for developing serious mental illnesses. This is known as the ""sensitization model."" Although this is a valid concept and has important implications regarding how we address mental health needs, it has also been criticized by researchers for overstating possible","The major problem is that many people have no idea how to identify and treat any of these issues. This leads to a lack of understanding, which in turn makes it harder for us all to work together as a community. To help you understand what these disorders are and what causes them, here is a list of nine common mental health disorders.

1. Depression

What's the cause of depression? If you look at the brain, one thing you will see is significant amounts of gray matter. Gray matter means information processing power. Think about your brain and its ability to process information. It uses up energy trying to make sense of everything, making decisions about whether or not something needs to be done. As we age, this gray matter shrinks. But because our brains don't stop growing, they still use up energy even when there isn't much happening in the world around us. When this gray matter is smaller than normal, it doesn't have enough room to do anything. In fact, the brain does not have enough space to store new memories. For example, if you were to lose a friend with Alzheimer's disease, your brain would likely remember some details from that person but could not actually create new ones—you might find yourself wondering where he was and why he left so suddenly. However, by losing those old memories (they aren't stored), you become able to access new memory traces. Therefore, even though we lose our friends, we are able to gain new ones through our memories. The result is that we can experience things like grief without feeling empty inside. While depression has been known to affect almost everyone at times, it tends to affect young adults the hardest. Researchers believe that the stress of having to move away from home and school plays into depression. That's because moving to a different place creates a lot of change in someone's life. It also changes their routines—it's hard for them to maintain friendships and relationships with the same group of people for extended periods. Also, studies show that women tend to suffer more from depression compared to men. Women spend longer hours at work and school, and they may miss out on family time. They're less social with other women; they have fewer close female friends and may stay silent about feelings of sadness and loneliness. Finally, the effects of living alone seem to play into depression. Many older women struggle with depression just as much as younger females. Those who live alone are often expected to take care of themselves, while others must rely upon others for emotional support. And research shows","A variety of mental illnesses affect people in varying degrees, and may be due to a number of factors such as genetics. Some of these include:

Alcoholism Alcoholism is one of the most common mental disorders, affecting about 10% of adults aged 18-65 (the largest age group affected). As well as causing many physical and psychological problems, alcohol use has an impact on your emotional and social functioning. The main symptoms of alcoholism are irritability, nervousness, poor memory, impaired judgement, difficulty concentrating, increased risk of accidents and driving under the influence, and decreased interest in activities that were once pleasurable. There is no cure for alcohol addiction but treatment will help you get through the day without using it. Read more about the effects of drinking alcohol. Mental illness often goes undiagnosed because there aren't enough signs to see. There is often confusion between depression and anxiety and between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder because they're both related to mood swings and changes in thinking patterns. If you suspect you have a mental health problem, talk to someone who understands your experience and needs support and advice. You'll want to know whether any treatments could work for you, so look at our page on what types of treatments might work for you and how to find out more. Depression Depression isn't always easy to spot, but if you notice yourself feeling down or hopeless, stop and think about why this is happening. For example, was something else bothering you recently? It's probably that your thoughts are too intense or too upsetting and need time to settle. It's important not to blame yourself - feel free to ask others for their opinions, too! Remember, you don't have to suffer alone. You can turn to family or friends for help, either individually or with groups like Lifeline and Beyond Blue. And remember: nobody is powerless over depression; try not to give up! Learn more about the causes of depression and ways to cope with it. Bipolar disorder Bipolar disorder affects around 1.5 million Australians according to research by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and around 10% of people with mental health problems. While some research suggests that around 40% of people with bipolar disorder are women, research suggests that men are twice as likely to develop the condition compared to women. Symptoms of bipolar disorder vary from person to person and depend on the individual's experiences during childhood, adolescence and adulthood, including: Changes in sleep pattern (insomnia, restless nights) and diet (anxiety, weight gain, cravings)

Changes in","People with serious mental illness have a higher risk of developing depression, anxiety and substance abuse disorders. It is important for people with these conditions to be able to recognize symptoms that may indicate a problem and seek help as soon as possible.[4]

What Is Depression?

Depression is a state of low mood. In general it's characterized by sadness, loss, hopelessness, fatigue, loss of interest in activities once enjoyed, difficulty concentrating, sleep disturbance, decreased energy level, feelings of worthlessness, irritability, social withdrawal, lack of enjoyment, and impaired judgment.[5] There's no cure for this condition. The best way to treat depression is to identify what causes it, learn about its causes and then take steps to alleviate them. For example, you might work on identifying the reasons why your depressed symptoms occur and taking action to change your lifestyle.[6] There are several types of depression and each one has unique characteristics:

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): MDD refers to major depressive episodes, which last at least two weeks. Major depressive disorder is the most common type of depression. It affects more than 15 million adults in America alone. [7]

(MDD refers to major depressive episodes, which last at least two weeks. Major depressive disorder is the most common type of depression. It affects more than 15 million adults in America alone. Bipolar Disorders (BD/BPD): Bipolar disorder (manic-depressive) is an illness where there are multiple cycles of manic (high energy) and depressive (low energy) episodes. These mood changes are called mania and hypomania. A person can experience periods of both. If you're experiencing some aspects of bipolar disorder, such as severe highs and lows, you need treatment. However, if you have only mild manic episodes but not depressive ones, you don't require treatment.

One in five Americans will experience mental illness in their lifetime, and about 14 percent of all American adults have been diagnosed with some form of depression.1

How do mental illnesses affect people in your life? Do you know someone who suffers from mental illness?

This fact sheet provides information on how mental disorders affect you in your daily lives. It focuses primarily on individuals ages 18 to 64. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates that approximately 4 million workers with a mental disorder were employed in 2011.2 Additionally, 1 out of 3 children and adolescents have experienced at least one episode of major depressive disorder within the past year.3","The majority of Americans with major depression have a significant family history. Many people who experience depression do not seek treatment because they perceive it to be ""too serious"" and/or they don't think that their depression is in anyone's control. If you believe your symptoms are related to stress, anxiety, substance abuse, or other factors, it may help to talk with someone about these conditions before considering seeking treatment for depression.

53,Question: what is psychotherapy?\nAnswer:,"psychotherapeutics, the study of human behavior with a focus on psychological (emotional) processes and the development of psychological knowledge.

In our own experience we are able to recognize some of the signs of depression when it comes to our clients, especially in cases where they have become more isolated from others or when there has been an increase in their level of stress or anxiety. However, we also see that many of them still struggle with this condition despite all these attempts at treatment. One may ask themselves why? Why doesn't the client just stop thinking about it? It seems impossible for us as psychologists to help someone who does not believe in therapy. We may try many methods, yet we still get no result, until one day we realize that while the patient might be depressed, he or she simply isn't talking about it because it is a symptom of the disease. This is the paradox of psychotherapy – its success depends upon the willingness of the person to talk about his problems. The first step in therapy is to identify which symptoms of illness have become prominent and/or if there were any changes in the way that you live your life, the way you relate to other people, or even the way you think. Then you need to figure out what causes the depression. If we do not understand the cause of the problem, then we will be unable to find the solution. To treat the actual problem we require extensive training and thorough research into the subject matter. In case of depression, most experts agree that the proper diagnosis should start from the biological end rather than a chemical one. Many people who are diagnosed with depression don't actually suffer from such a disease as depression can only be recognized by a direct link to brain chemistry. There are also various medications available to treat depression. The medication used depends on whether the person suffers from the mood disorder known as major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) or dysthymia (a form of depression caused by mental problems like obsessive-compulsive tendencies). Sometimes patients feel better after taking anti depressants but they tend to lose their appetite. Also, they sometimes come off the medication due to side effects and eventually relapse. Some people prefer to take an antidepressant medication without having a doctor prescribe it to them. Other times people prefer to use an SSRI antidepressant medication without going through a psychiatrist's office. You should choose the medication based on the type of depression you're suffering from.

How long does the course of depression last?

A survey conducted in 2002 found that one","the process of healing, change and growth; mental health treatment \nAnswer: the science and practice of counseling; psychological therapy (P.T.A.) in particular.

What is psychodynamic therapy? \nAnswer: a theory that suggests the development of personal identity from within. The idea is that as a person grows up, he or she creates his or her own unique personality. Psychodynamic therapists believe that the way people handle stress affects their feelings about themselves, which then influences their choices. They also view life as being interwoven with our feelings about other people, and are not afraid to examine issues that may cause stress.

Psychodynamic therapy was introduced by Carl Jung. He studied it in depth in the 1920s and 1930s. It has since become widely accepted throughout the world and is used by many physicians and psychiatrists. In addition, some psychologists have developed psychoanalytic theories that attempt to explain away certain types of negative feelings.

Why use psychodynamic therapy for depression? \nAnswer: Because while most treatments focus on one problem at a time, psychodynamic therapy focuses on changing your entire attitude toward each situation. This approach makes it easier to identify potential problems before they lead to more serious emotional problems. When you start to feel sad or depressed, talk to someone who understands your issues. If you can't figure out how to fix things yourself, see if you can find someone else who will help you.

How do I go about learning psychodynamic therapy? \nAnswer: There are many ways to learn psychodynamic therapy. You could join a group like Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, where everyone listens to an individual session on tape. Or try books about psychodynamic therapy, such as Richard Gardner's book, ""The Way of Psychoanalysis."" These books cover the basics of psychodynamic therapy, but also discuss some of the different methods used by psychotherapists today.

One great thing about therapy is there is no right or wrong way to get treatment. You can learn psychodynamic therapy any way that works best for you.","it's the act of changing our thoughts and beliefs about ourselves, others or our world, especially through talking with a trained mental health professional. It involves both talking to someone who can help you better understand your feelings, but also trying out new ideas about how to handle things from that point of view. The primary goal is to change our behaviors to improve our lives. (source)

Psychology \u2014 psychology \u2019 is a branch of science that deals with human behaviour and mental processes. The field has many sub-fields which deal with different aspects of human life, including cognitive psychology, social psychology, biological/social psychology, developmental psychology, neuropsychology, and cultural psychology. \u201cThe field is diverse because it includes all fields of study that have something to do with people's behaviour, from neuroscience to sociology to anthropology. As a discipline, it also encompasses the study of how individuals think, behave, and feel, and how their knowledge and attitudes affect their lives. (Wikipedia)","a systematic, individualized treatment of psychological problems that relies on the principles of psychology.\

""Psychological"" \, is defined as any mental process or state other than those resulting from physical causes, but including (but not limited to) thought processes and perceptions, memory, personality, personality traits, attitudes, behaviors, emotions, etc. Psychology is the branch of sociology concerned with the study of human behavior. It deals with all aspects of how people think, feel, behave, make decisions, perceive, remember, remember, etc.. The term ""psychology"" was first used by Francis Galton in 1852 when he used the word to refer specifically to mental science. In addition to this use by Galton, the word has been popularly applied to non-physical phenomena such as psychophysiology, neurophysiology, biophysics, psychiatry, neurology, behavioral medicine, social psychology, psychology, cognitive neuroscience, neuroeconomics, cognitive ethology, evolutionary biology, evolutionary psychology, and so forth. By the way, the last one means that the word's definition varies according to whether you're talking about evolution or something else entirely. For example, some scientists see the word evolution as referring exclusively to biological changes; others argue that it can be applied to whatever process produces new species, regardless of its genetic origins. I'll leave it up to your imagination if you want to define the terms ""psychology"", ""behavioral economics"", ""neuroeconomics"", and/or ""behavioral research"".

So, basically, what does an individual therapist do? Well, we don't actually have a great deal of information, because therapy is very much a ""black box."" We still know very little about it. Some therapists may be involved in more than one type of therapy. However, most therapists will only treat a single type of problem at a time. We often hear of patients who are treated for different issues using the same therapist. That is just not true. You must understand why before you try to work through the ""mental health"" problems yourself. Most therapists specialize in working on specific problems, sometimes dealing with multiple types of problems simultaneously. This can lead to confusion. What works for one person may not work for another. And most therapists who specialize in particular areas cannot tell you anything about working on problems outside their area of expertise. As a result, clients come to therapy with a huge variety of concerns. One therapist might get stuck thinking that they need therapy and then discover that they're fine without it.","a means of solving problems by changing the way we think, feel and act.

This may sound like a fairly straightforward answer but for many people who are struggling with mental illness or other difficulties, it's not. Psychotherapy offers you some help, a way to deal with your challenges without having to confront them directly. It can also be very useful in helping you make sense of the world around you - to understand why things seem so important to others and to understand how you might have made such mistakes as to cause someone else distress.

The goal of psychotherapy is to help you change these problematic thinking patterns, feelings and behaviours that keep you from enjoying life and dealing with life's stresses. The best treatment helps patients learn to see their problems through new eyes, so they no longer view themselves as victims, rather as being able to improve their lives through learning to cope with whatever life throws at us.

In general, our understanding of what psychological treatments involve has changed in recent years. Some believe that therapy should only be offered under professional supervision and that, if there's any chance of improvement, it should happen after all other therapies have been tried. These views don't reflect the reality of modern mental health services, however. Therapy is not always effective, but often it can provide an opportunity to learn about and improve specific aspects of your behaviour and personality, enabling you to live more positively. This can give you more confidence, improve relationships, reduce negative thoughts, and lead to improvements in well-being.

You can find out whether psychotherapy could benefit you by asking your GP or mental health nurse (or your local council) whether it would be suitable for you. You'll usually need to go through screening procedures before getting started, which will determine if this is something likely to work for you. If you're unsure or want to ask questions about the benefits of therapy, talk to one of your friends, family or carers.

There is no single 'right' kind of therapist. Treatment will depend on your personal circumstances, preferences and strengths. However, here are some guidelines based on research evidence.

What to expect in therapy

It's common to hear therapists refer to clients as 'you', so it's helpful to know what types of therapy do and don't work for you.

General cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT): CBT focuses on how to identify and modify unhealthy beliefs and behaviours that are affecting your ability to manage stress, manage emotions, or take advantage of opportunities available to you.","Psychotherapy is a therapeutic process that focuses on the individual's interaction with his/her environment and the influence of his/her thoughts, feelings and behavior. It can also be defined as a mental or psychological intervention in order to resolve or correct problems in one's life.

In psychiatry, it may be used for the treatment of some forms of psychiatric disorders (such as depression) as well as other conditions such as anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Psychotherapy was first introduced into medicine by Otto Rank in 1884, in which he proposed an approach called ""Korrespondenz"" (or Korrelation), which focuses on the patient's inner emotional reactions to specific situations in his environment. The aim is to help the client change his own behaviors and attitudes towards these situations, thus reducing their impact on him or her. Today, this form of therapy is widely accepted as the standard method of treating depressive symptoms in most countries. Although there are many different types of psychotherapy, each having its own characteristics and advantages over others, they all share common goals: to assist patients with coping and/or increasing resilience against difficulties related to their condition.

What kind of tasks do psychologists perform?\u003c\/p>\u003e

Psychologists are trained professionals who specialize in the analysis and interpretation of human behavior and personality. Their main task is to use objective methods to collect data and gather information from participants to create a more comprehensive picture of how people think and behave. As individuals develop and mature, they tend to acquire habits that make them less able to cope with everyday challenges. Psychological therapy aims to promote improvement in coping abilities through ongoing personal development and learning skills that will enable people to better cope with stressful life events and circumstances.

How much does your salary depend on where you live?\u003c\/p>\u003e

Your pay depends on your location. According to the American Community Survey 1-year estimates for 2016, average annual salaries are $60,000 for those living in the northeast; $62,000 for those living in the Midwest; $67,400 for those living in the West; and $73,100 for those living in the South. In contrast, the national median annual income for Americans aged 25 years or older is just under $50,000.

The Best States for Psychology Jobs\u003c\/p>","a method of changing the attitudes and behaviours that produce psychological problems, i.e., ""mental illness."" It is often used by psychiatrists to treat disorders such as depression, anxiety and schizophrenia.

The American Psychiatric Association (APA) defines psychotherapy in their Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV as treatment designed to help people change their mindsets or beliefs about mental health issues. The first version of the DSM was published in 1952, and Psychotherapy has been recognized as an integral part of mental health care since its introduction in 1935.1,2 There are many different types of psychotherapies, but all involve some type of interaction between the clinician and patient.3–5 These can include group sessions, individual counseling, cognitive behavioral therapy, problem-solving techniques, self-help groups, family counseling, etc. Most forms of psychotherapy can be administered individually or in groups, though they may not require this level of training and expertise for the practitioner.4 Some forms of psychotherapy have additional requirements for approval from government agencies, such as passing state licensing boards, which may take time and cost more than other treatments that do not require licensing.6

Psychoeducation is widely accepted as one form of psychotherapy;7 however, there is no consensus on whether it should be considered a valid approach. Some research indicates that psychoeducation can benefit patients with chronic diseases,8 yet others claim it does little to improve outcomes among those with serious conditions like cancer, heart disease, or stroke.9,10 Psychoeducation may increase awareness and understanding of mental illness, but without rigorous scientific evidence it cannot be recommended as a method of treatment.11

What are the benefits of psychotherapy?

As we will see below, there are several reasons why it might be worthwhile to explore psychotherapy in addition to other methods. Here are just three reasons that I believe it may be beneficial to consider psychotherapy when treating various physical illnesses:12

1. Improved quality of life

Studies have found improvements in quality of life after psychotherapy.13 For example, a 2012 study found that a 20-minute session of psychotherapy for children diagnosed with asthma improved their symptoms significantly more than placebo (placebo consisted of water).14 Furthermore, a 2015 study revealed significant decreases in anxiety, depression, social phobia, perfectionism, anger/hostility, and posttraumatic stress disorder after being treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), compared with MBSR alone.15 In another","the treatment of mental disorder by an individual or group of professionals, usually in a therapeutic setting.

The Psychoanalytic Therapy Association (PTA) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that works to ensure that the benefits and practices of psychoanalysis are used throughout the world for the benefit of those suffering from psychiatric disorders and their families. Our goal is to create a community of people who have been touched by psychoanalytic theory and who want to give back by promoting the good practices found within it.","A therapist is an individual who assists another person in adjusting to his or her own experiences. This adjustment process takes many forms, including psychological treatment; however, a key aspect of therapy is helping the client become aware of and cope with these issues.\r

""The goal of psychotherapy is to help people develop better relationships, gain self-acceptance and build self-confidence in order to be able to use their strengths more effectively to achieve goals."" \r

Types of Psychotherapists:\r

Psychologists are typically trained as clinical social workers who specialize in working with patients whose emotional difficulties stem from mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, trauma, grief and loss, eating disorders and other personality disorders. In addition to providing individual therapy, psychologists work closely with other professionals to provide group, family, marital and vocational counseling for specific populations. These individuals may also participate in research studies that examine the effectiveness of certain types of interventions that are tailored specifically to each person's situation.""\r

- The Society for Humanistic Psychology\r


What Are Therapeutic Techniques?: \r

Therapeutic techniques include methods which attempt to address underlying causes of one's distress or emotional disturbance, as well as strategies for changing dysfunctional patterns of thought, behavior and perception. It is important to understand that not all therapeutic techniques can be used to treat everyone equally well; some treatments will produce greater benefits than others. For instance, there might be a need for a different set of approaches if an individual has a tendency towards obsessive-compulsive disorder or even borderline personality disorder. However, those therapists who have experience working with people who suffer from these disorders know that they can often offer much needed insight into the causes of the symptoms and even possible solutions.\r

- National Institute of Mental Health\r


How Does Therapy Work?: \r

In therapy, both the therapist and the patient engage in a process where each attempts to uncover what causes the individual's problem(s), identify obstacles preventing the solution, and then seek creative or productive means of addressing the condition.\r

Who Can Treat Me"
54,Question: What does multiple sclerosis diagnosis include? What does it change?\nAnswer:,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord. The main symptoms of MS are muscle weakness, numbness, or tingling in some parts of your body. Your doctor will order tests to check for any physical problems that might be causing your symptoms. This may involve an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), blood test (glucose level testing), skin biopsy, and/or other procedures. While these tests help determine what's going on with your immune system, they don't always tell you exactly why you have those symptoms. Doctors also use a variety of medications to treat the symptoms of MS. They can do so by changing how your immune system works, using drugs such as steroids to shrink the nerve cells in your spinal cord and treating conditions that cause inflammation (such as rheumatoid arthritis).

What is a neuropathic pain condition?

Q: How common is this type of pain? Why should I be concerned about it?

A: Neuropathic pain, sometimes called chronic pain syndrome, describes pain that occurs after surgery. It usually happens within 10 days of the operation but can happen months later.

It affects 1 out of every 5 people who have had nerve damage from nerve-damaging medical treatments, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, endocrine treatment for hormone imbalance, and certain types of surgeries, including knee replacements, hip replacements, lumbar punctures, spinal taps, and carpal tunnel syndrome.

Nerve damage in both sides of the spine causes severe nerve pain, which often goes away during recovery time if treated properly. But over time, the problem may come back. If untreated, nerve damage could lead to permanent numbness, muscle weakness, or paralysis in one side of the body. These conditions are known as peripheral neuropathy.

This list doesn't cover all the possible ways in which nerve damage may affect patients' health. You may want to talk with your healthcare provider about other types of nerve-related pain and about treatment options.

Neuropathy Symptoms

Q: When did you first notice symptoms of numbness, tingling, or sensitivity to touch?

A: Many people experience painful sensations, especially after minor surgical procedures, such as cataract extractions or ear infections. In addition, these nerves provide sensation to your face, lips, tongue, and hands. Numbness, tingling, and sensitivity are most likely to develop before an operation","Multiple Sclerosis is a neurological disorder that involves the central nervous system and affects approximately 1 in every 3,000 people. People with MS experience severe disability on two sides of their body. The symptoms are typically worse when walking or using movement tools, and they can be debilitating. Many of those who have MS also experience loss of vision (visual impairment), hearing problems, bladder control issues, muscular weakness, and difficulty swallowing.\r

\r

The disease progresses slowly over time, but eventually it causes irreversible damage to the brain's ability to send messages between cells (neurologic deficit). Without treatment, people will usually die before age 40. \r

\r

Multiple Sclerosis can develop at any age, even during childhood. In young children, symptoms may not appear until adolescence or early adulthood; however, by the mid-20s many children may show signs of MS.\r

\r

In most cases, multiple sclerosis is diagnosed through a physical exam or an MRI scan. During the examination, your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and what happens around your home and work. Your doctor may order blood tests as well. These tests determine if there might be a problem with your immune system (antibody) levels; whether your immune system has been damaged due to another condition such as cancer; and how long ago you had a previous episode of MS.\r

\r

At this point, your doctor may prescribe medicines called ""MS drugs"" that help improve or slow some of the effects of MS. These drugs, sometimes referred to as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), target specific proteins in MS patients' brains that cause inflammation and other symptoms. Some mAbs, like Imbruvica, are available without a prescription, while others, including Interferon Beta, must be prescribed.\r

\r

Once you have a good idea of what the problem might be, your doctor may suggest different treatments for you based on your individual circumstances. You could try one drug after another or take more than one medicine at once. Treatment choices depend on several factors, including your general health, your risk factors for developing MS (such as age, sex, family history, smoking status, and alcohol use), and the nature of the disease and its progression. For example, someone who takes high doses of interferon beta daily because of a genetic predisposition for MS risks losing the ability to feel pain.\r

\","Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system. It involves damage to certain cells in the brain and spinal cord (nerve tissue). Damage occurs when an immune cell called T-cells attack and destroy these nerve cells. The main symptom of MS is weakness or paralysis of one part of your body. You may have symptoms of tingling, numbness, burning pain, a rapid heartbeat, problems with vision, balance, speech, or swallowing. Other symptoms can be related to another condition, such as diabetes.


\r Answer: Your doctor will first do a neurological exam to determine whether you have MS. This includes looking for signs of disease on physical exams and asking about your medical history. If you have a family history of MS or other health conditions that might cause symptoms, your doctor will ask you additional questions. For example, if your doctor finds a rash on your neck while doing an examination, he or she will check for MS in order to rule out the possibility that you have the disorder.


\r Answer: A neurologist performs tests that are used to diagnose MS. These tests examine your nerves to see how they work normally, and then the doctors compare your results to those of people who don't have MS. In some cases, your neurologist may try to identify which parts of your central nervous system are affected by MS. For example, your physician may do CT scans to look at your spinal cords. Also, your doctor may use imaging procedures, like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to study areas of the brain involved with learning and memory. In addition, your doctor may perform blood tests to look for changes in immune function during the course of MS, such as markers called C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). These levels fluctuate throughout the year. Tests that measure CRP can show whether the immune system has been weakened, leading to inflammation and possibly neurological problems. IL-6 helps regulate how the immune system responds to bacteria. An elevated level indicates increased bacterial activity in the body.


\r Answer: Many medications can help relieve symptoms of MS. Medications that treat fatigue and muscle stiffness could improve coordination. Some types of corticosteroids reduce the severity of symptoms. Certain antiepileptic drugs can make it easier for your brain's neurons to communicate with each other. Antipsychotic drugs also can ease symptoms associated with anxiety and panic attacks. Other medications can decrease the amount of swelling in your legs that can occur","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, affecting 1 out of every 100 people over the age of 65. It affects different parts of the body at different times; most often in the joints and spinal cord. \r

The main symptoms are pain, stiffness, weakness, vision problems and hearing loss. The condition can be severe, causing paralysis or partial paralysis. The average life expectancy for those with MS is 10 to 15 years.[i]\r

What is the best treatment for multiple sclerosis?\r

Many different therapies have been tried in an effort to find a cure for MS. Some medications help alleviate some of these symptoms. While some types of medication are used alone, others may require daily maintenance therapy. For example, steroids are prescribed for many conditions. However, they aren't effective for all MS patients, so other forms of treatment may also be needed.

Other treatments involve using natural medicines such as vitamin supplements. These have proven effective for some patients who haven't responded well to other medical treatments. Others use immune-modulating drugs called immunomodulators that modulate the immune response. Although there's no cure yet for multiple sclerosis, improving your quality of life through treatments like acupuncture, massage, exercise, stress reduction, diet changes and nutrition are considered effective ways to treat your MS.

Why did doctors fail to diagnose me with multiple sclerosis until I was much older than my parents and younger than my siblings?\r

Doctors don't generally know if someone has MS because of their appearance or behavior unless a person develops some physical signs. If you've ever had trouble breathing, dizziness, blurred vision, numbness or tingling, weakness or difficulty walking, you probably have MS. You'll likely need a thorough exam by a doctor to rule out other conditions before making any diagnoses. \r

How do I avoid getting MS?\r

To prevent MS from happening, learn what causes the inflammation and damage that causes pain and disability in many people with MS. Avoid foods high in omega 6 fatty acids that are known to increase blood levels of this fatty acid, such as butter, chicken and fish oil. Limit your intake of processed sugar. Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables. Also reduce your risk factors for heart disease, diabetes, obesity and smoking by eating healthy food choices and exercising regularly. \r

[i] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8114053","Multiple sclerosis is the most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting about one in every 2.5 million adults and children worldwide. The initial symptoms of MS are commonly referred to as ""meningitis."" These first symptoms may be mild (occurring on their own or within a few days after exposure to an infectious agent) but can rapidly progress into more serious problems such as seizures, paralysis, cognitive impairments, vision impairment, deafness and even death.

When a person develops MS, they often experience weakness throughout the body, including limbs, arms, legs and face. Their ability to walk and perform daily activities usually begins gradually and then worsens over time. Symptoms also vary from person to person, depending on how much damage has already been done by other diseases and what genetic vulnerabilities exist in that individual's DNA. Some people with MS have no noticeable changes when diagnosed, while others develop signs and symptoms that last for years before improvement occurs. There are currently two types of MS: relapsing-remitting and secondary-progressive. Relapsing-remitting forms occur in between 1% and 5% of cases, although up to 40% of individuals will eventually have this form of the disease. Secondary-progressive forms are caused by mutations in the gene that encodes for the protein called myelin basic protein. This is a major component of the protective covering around nerve fibers. When the myelin sheath wears away, the nerves become damaged and can lose function. Patients who have had MS for less than 10 years typically begin developing relapses during their 20s and 30s. In the early stages, people with progressive forms do not experience any symptoms, but over time, the brain may begin changing in ways that cause them pain, fatigue, depression, trouble speaking, difficulty walking and bladder control. By the late stages, many patients experience sensory loss, difficulty swallowing, muscle spasms, blurred vision, slurred speech, difficulty chewing and swallowing, and memory impairment. Although relapsing-remitting and secondary-progressive forms are considered different diseases, some researchers believe that these forms should actually be classified together as ""primary-onset"" or ""chronic,"" because each type can lead to significant disability in its own right.\r


How will I know if I've got multiple sclerosis?\r

This depends on which form you're dealing with. If the signs and symptoms get worse with activity -- especially without treatment -- then you probably have primary-onset MS. You'll likely need","Multiple sclerosis is a disease that damages the myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells. Myelin is what protects and insulates our nerves, so this damage can lead to paralysis or even death from complications.

MS causes inflammation of the brain and spinal cord (called demyelination). This leads to loss of electrical signals between cells in the central nervous system. Symptoms range from mild symptoms like numbness and tingling around your body, such as hands and feet, to more severe ones like progressive muscle weakness, vision problems, hearing changes and difficulty speaking.

In most cases, MS can be diagnosed by taking a blood test that measures levels of certain chemicals called antibodies to try to determine whether you have antibodies to MS. Some people may also need an MRI scan of their head to look at lesions caused by the autoimmune process of MS. The cause of MS is unknown. It's believed that genetic factors are involved, although studies have shown no link between genes and MS.

Some treatments for MS, such as steroids and immune-suppressing drugs, help reduce symptoms, but there's no cure. Treatment doesn't work for everyone. And some types of MS — particularly those with longer duration and/or worse progression than other forms of the condition — do not respond well to treatment. Although there isn't enough evidence to say one way or another which patients will benefit or suffer the worst outcome, research suggests that if you're affected by MS, early detection and treatment is probably worth considering. You'll still want to discuss potential side effects of any treatments with your doctor before starting them.

See related: Diagnostic tests, Multiple sclerosis, Disease processes","Multiple sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the central nervous system. The main symptoms are weakness and numbness in the legs, arms, or face (fibromyalgia), problems with vision (flashes of light or blind spots) that can last for months and often affect both eyes at once (peripheral neuritis), and progressive loss of muscle strength, including paralysis. It may cause trouble walking (myasthenia gravis).

The treatment includes medication to prevent or lessen these symptoms. In people who don't respond well to medications, doctors might try surgery (called a spinal cord stimulator) to help them walk. It's also possible to get an experimental drug called interferon-alpha that might improve symptoms in some people. Treatment involves drugs and other treatments over time. Some people have had partial relief by taking steroids during the first years after diagnosis, but not all do. Most people continue to take the same type of medication throughout their lives.

More Information on MS

For more information about multiple sclerosis, see our resources below:","Multiple sclerosis is a disease in which the body's own immune system attacks and destroys brain tissue. It causes weakness, loss of balance, slurred speech and difficulty walking.\r

\t \nThe type of MS affects people differently. For some, the symptoms can be mild or moderate; for others, they are severe or disabling.\r

\t \rIn addition to MS, there are several other conditions that can cause similar symptoms and lead to damage to nerve cells. These are called central nervous system (CNS) diseases such as stroke, epilepsy and Alzheimer's. They may cause the same physical problems as MS.\r

\r

What Causes Multiple Sclerosis?""Multiple Sclerosis"" is a term used to describe two distinct forms of neurological disease in humans. The first form is primary progressive MS (PPRMS), in which the individual with the condition gradually loses control over muscle movement and function. This usually happens by age 30, but in some cases, the disease might not show its full effects until later in life. In contrast, secondary progressive MS occurs after someone has already developed PPRMS. Although this kind of MS tends to take longer to develop than PPRMS, it also appears much more rapidly. Secondary progressive MS is most often caused by another autoimmune disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. It is also possible for both types of MS to occur together. There is no cure for either form of the disease, although treatment for each type can help reduce the severity of symptoms. A thorough understanding of how MS works will enable you to understand what is happening to your body, particularly when a person is experiencing multiple symptoms at once.\r

\r

How Is Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosed?\r

Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPRMS): PPRMS results from an immune response against brain cells known as oligodendrocytes. These nerve cells secrete substances that promote inflammation throughout the body. When this inflammatory process goes too far, PPRMS can result in scarring within the brain tissue itself. Because these areas of the brain have less blood flow compared to other parts of the body, inflammation worsens. When this takes place, some patients experience a variety of symptoms including numbness, tingling and muscle spasms. Other symptoms are limited to particular regions of their bodies, such as fingers or toes that feel slightly off-kilter.

Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPM","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that results from an imbalance between myelin sheath and axon. It usually begins in childhood or adolescence as a neurologic disease with symptoms that are similar to those of other chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. MS has also been called Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS).

A number of factors may increase your risk for developing MS, including exposure to toxic substances during pregnancy; genetic predisposition; inherited factor(s); immunosuppression; malnutrition; infections; and certain environmental exposures, particularly smoking. Smoking increases the likelihood of developing MS by suppressing the production of interleukin (IL)-10, which plays a role in the body's immune response. IL-10 is produced by macrophages in your lungs when you breathe. This suppression prevents your body's natural defense mechanisms against infection from working properly. As a result, bacteria can enter into your bloodstream and cause inflammation that leads to MS. The increased risk of getting MS in smokers could be attributed to their decreased ability to produce IL-10.

What happens if I develop MS? If you have MS, you might experience several of these signs and symptoms. You might also experience some of the following complications: disability;

muscle weakness;

seizures;

convulsions (fits);

psychosis (delusions), especially hallucinations;

arthritis/joint pain; and

visual impairment (blindness). These complications are related to both physical and mental impairments associated with MS. The extent of your impairment will depend on how severe your MS is, how long you have had it, and whether you are taking medications for this condition. In addition, all patients who develop symptoms and signs of MS should be evaluated by a physician. An evaluation includes evaluating your medical history, asking about current treatment options, examining you closely using a variety of techniques such as special tests and MRIs, conducting laboratory studies, and performing imaging studies. A complete examination should include reviewing your neurological exam, checking blood pressure, measuring your heart rate, and looking at other signs and symptoms.

What causes MS? Scientists still do not know what triggers MS and why it occurs. They believe that MS develops over time due to changes within your brain cells. Some experts think that the major trigger may be the environment you live in. For example, people living in colder climates tend to get more colds than","Multiple sclerosis is a rare but progressive disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord. It causes weakness in muscles, vision problems, trouble speaking or walking, loss of balance, and pain. The most common signs are headache, difficulty swallowing, numbness around your neck, arm and/or leg, fatigue, tingling sensations on the skin, muscle spasms (spasticity), stiffness, and shortness of breath. In people with MS, these symptoms may start before any other symptoms show up.


This disease may cause you to have seizures, which can be life-threatening. If you do experience an episode of seizure, get medical help right away because it could turn into another attack called a full-blown seizure (also known as a grand mal).

Q: Can my child get MS if they had it when they were younger?


A: Yes. But if their body didn't develop enough antibodies against the autoimmune diseases, then they're unlikely to get them again, according to Dr. Michael Nader, professor of pediatrics at the University of Chicago Medicine. Some research suggests there's no ""cure"" for a genetic form of MS. However, if you did have it as a child, there are treatments available now that may help prevent future episodes of symptoms. See our article: MS Drugs May Help Prevent Seizures, by Dr. Michael Nader, for more information.

Q: Why should I take blood tests when diagnosing MS?


A: All doctors who treat patients with MS are familiar with the fact that many children are misdiagnosed. This happens when a doctor thinks he or she has one thing and discovers later that the patient really has another condition. Sometimes, there is no way to know for sure whether a person has MS until years after they've been diagnosed—and some young people don't even realize they have it. It's important to check both sides of a patient's family history, including possible risk factors such as maternal smoking during pregnancy, having several siblings with the same MS type, and siblings with or without MS. Also, consider taking the test early so that you'll know what results to expect.

55,Question: How to manage multiple sclerosis?\nAnswer:,"The management of MS is a complex one. It requires that you identify your specific treatment goals, and carefully plan for the different ways in which they may be achieved through medications, lifestyle changes and other interventions.

In some instances there are no treatments, because there really isn't anything wrong with the body's own immune system at all. In others, however, certain drugs do have an impact on the immune response of the brain (for example, immunosuppressive medicines like corticosteroids). A person who uses these drugs as part of his/her daily routine can develop autoimmune disease. The best way to prevent this from happening is to use the right combination of drugs or to stop using them altogether. If that fails, then a transplant may help. In fact, there is evidence that transplantation might be able to improve symptoms associated with MS in people already taking certain types of anti-rejection medicine.[11] In the event that these therapies fail, surgery is often an option. If that doesn't work either, then life-long immunomodulatory therapy, such as interferon beta-1b, might play a role.

Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis — Overview

How does a doctor treat MS?

Your health care team will begin by determining whether you have a neurological disorder related to your MS. They'll also determine if any physical problems present themselves.

You're likely to get most of your medical care from a neurologist, but he or she will consult specialists in many fields—including neurology, psychiatry, ophthalmology and rheumatology—to decide what kind of treatment is appropriate. Your doctors may order MRI scans or CT scans, blood tests, or other examinations to look for signs of damage to nerve cells in the brain (neurological deficit), optic nerves, arteries, veins and capillaries that supply the brain, spinal cord, limbs, joints, skin, tendons, muscles and bones. These examinations may include X-rays, MRIs or CAT scans.

Depending upon their expertise and experience, the specialists may prescribe medication or non-pharmaceutical approaches such as exercise training, nutrition, vitamin supplements and psychotherapy.

A variety of medications are available to control MS symptoms, including steroids, immunosuppressants (drugs that suppress the immune system), and other drugs called ""biologics."" Biologic drugs are generally taken by mouth. Examples include cycloserine, alend","It can be managed successfully, but it is complicated.

Risk Factors and Risk of Disease

There are a number of factors that may increase the risk of MS onset or progression. The following list outlines some of the most important ones.

Age : A person's age is a strong predictor of whether he/she will develop MS. Approximately 20 percent of people who have MS when they are 40 years old will develop this disease within 10 years.

A person's age is a strong predictor of whether he/she will develop MS. Approximately 20 percent of people who have MS when they are 40 years old will develop this disease within 10 years. Family history : Having a close relative with MS increases your chances of developing MS as well. Another family member has the condition also increases your risk by an estimated 5 to 7 percent.

Having a close relative with MS increases your chances of developing MS as well. Another family member has the condition also increases your risk by an estimated 5 to 7 percent. Sex : Women appear to be at a slightly higher risk for developing MS than men. This difference appears to be due to the fact women experience more symptoms and flare-ups in their first year after infection. Men also have longer periods during which MS attacks them.

For example, obese people generally have a lower body mass index than those with a normal weight. While some studies show that obesity is","It's a complicated disease, but if you follow the advice below, your odds of survival are better than 50 percent.

If you have MS and are an adult or teenager, it is not too late to start taking medicines that help control symptoms (at least for 2-3 years). A doctor should prescribe you medicine when he or she thinks you may benefit from treatment.

When you're young, you may need fewer medicines to get the same effect as someone who has had more severe symptoms before starting treatment. But keep in mind that many medications can cause serious side effects, so talk with your doctor about which one is right for you. If there are risks associated with a particular drug, do not take it until you've talked with your doctor first. Some drugs may increase the risk of developing another condition called Alzheimer's disease, especially those that affect your central nervous system. Talk to your doctor about what is safe for you, including whether you should use certain medicines together while you're on other medicines.

If you already know how well you respond to certain treatments, continue them even though they might be causing problems. Doctors often give people with MS new drugs at different times during their illness. That way, the body learns what kind of effect each medication will have, and then it adapts to those effects. In addition, doctors sometimes change medications because of side effects, so it's important that you check with your doctor regularly.

Even if you're able to tolerate some medicines, you shouldn't stop all of them. For example, you'll probably still need painkillers and others may only make your symptoms worse. It is also essential that you eat nutritious food and avoid caffeine and alcohol. Finally, remember that just because you seem better now doesn't mean the problem won't come back. Treatments work by changing how the brain processes information. Sometimes that makes things feel better temporarily, but usually the problems remain — they'll return just like they always did.","In general, MS sufferers should avoid taking certain medications. These include calcium channel blockers (such as amlodipine), rifampin and methotrexate. However, some studies have shown that many patients may benefit from certain drugs such as natalizumab or glatiramer acetate. Other treatments include exercise and physical therapy.

What if I've never had it?

Q. What's the best way for me to know if I'm in a high-risk group of people who develop my form of MS?\nAnswer: If you have an abnormal CT scan, your doctor can make an educated guess about whether you are more likely than others to develop this disease. This is called ""prevalence"" or ""clustering."" But it won't tell you exactly which MS symptoms and signs you're most at risk for. You'll need another type of test — one that uses genetic testing — to learn what kind of MS you might have. Genetic tests work by analyzing how closely related groups of cells on your body express genes associated with MS. If you carry these genes, then the diseases are more likely to run together.

The National Multiple Sclerosis Society has helpful information on identifying MS risks. The Mayo Clinic also offers information about detecting and treating MS.

How do doctors determine if I have MS?

Q. Can MS be treated?\nAnswer: No. Most types of treatment for MS are based on medications. Doctors generally agree that drugs that help control inflammation, reduce nerve damage and stimulate the immune system are effective. Medications used to treat MS often increase the effectiveness of other medicines. They can sometimes improve symptoms without causing side effects. For instance, steroids reduce muscle stiffness caused by MS. Some drugs slow the progression of the disease, though they don't cure it. When possible, doctors recommend using them alongside other treatments, such as physical therapy.

Many people prefer alternative therapies, too, including acupuncture, chiropractic care and meditation. Aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen are commonly prescribed for pain when treating MS. Corticosteroids can be used to prevent joint swelling, but they shouldn't be taken long term because they raise the risk of bleeding. Long-term use of corticosteroids can cause problems like increased cholesterol levels, ulcers, kidney stones and diabetes.

How to manage multiple sclerosis symptoms

This section explains the different ways to manage symptoms that are common with multiple sclerosis (MS). They include:

Using medications for pain relief and stiffness.

Managing other conditions such as headaches or depression.

Taking nutritional supplements.

If you have diabetes, talk with your doctor about reducing sugar intake.

The following tips apply in most cases but are not a substitute for seeking medical attention if needed.

Treatment goals

Although there is no cure for multiple sclerosis (MS), treatment is often very effective in controlling symptoms. The main goal of treatment is to relieve the signs of symptoms while slowing down the progression of the disease. This can be achieved by using medicines (including those listed below) or lifestyle changes. If severe, this may mean discontinuing treatments for several weeks or months at a time so that the immune system can return to its normal balance after relapse occurs. In extreme situations, however, discontinuation may be necessary.

Drugs

Most people who have MS respond well to one or two drugs. These range from medicine to exercise regimens that help reduce muscle spasms caused by inflammation. Depending on your condition and tolerance level, you should try several types of medication to find the best treatment strategy for you. Each type has a different side effect profile—for example, some may cause dizziness, while others may make it easier to walk—and each also provides certain benefits in reducing fatigue, increasing cognitive function, and improving sleep quality. You may need to repeat drug treatments when new symptoms arise because they may affect drug absorption through the gut. For more information, see Drug interactions.

Medication that affects nerve cells called myelin sheath Myelin sheath is an insulating layer that surrounds nerves throughout the body. It helps protect the nerve cells against damage and allows them to transmit signals between parts of the brain and spinal cord. When the myelin sheath is damaged, the signal sent between the brain and muscles is weakened. People with MS experience numbness or tingling in their legs, arms, hands, face, and feet. Some people feel weakness, paralysis, loss of bladder control, abnormal sensations in their ears, eyes, tongue, and throat, or difficulty breathing. Other problems include vision changes, hearing loss, and trouble swallowing.

There are many different types of treatment","\m/ There is no cure for MS, but there are treatments. You may have a good prognosis if you use the right treatment. Don't take too many medications or get an immune-system boost from taking certain medicines. Avoid being overexerted, particularly in your mind and body. Do regular exercise; eat a healthy diet; keep stress under control.

What Can I Do About Multiple Sclerosis?

1. Learn about it

You can learn more about multiple sclerosis at www.discovermultiplesclerosis.org.

2. Be aware of your triggers

Some people with MS feel better if they avoid certain situations. For example, it's not advisable to go out when you have an attack of symptoms. Keep away from loud noises that could trigger attacks. And make sure to stay as calm and patient as possible during these times.","The main problem is that the disease is progressive and the body doesn't adapt well. One of the ways to minimize this risk is by using an anti-inflammatory drug, such as ibuprofen (Advil®) or naproxen sodium (Aleve). These drugs are effective in preventing flare ups but they can be harmful if used too often. This may lead to an adverse reaction called ""post-exertional malaise"" which lasts for a few days after stopping treatment.

Avoiding these risks means going slow with your medication. Don't take more than 1 hour between taking a dose of ibuprofen and another one. Use only small amounts of aspirin at a time.

Another way to reduce post-exertional malaise is to avoid exercise, especially long distance running, while you're on medication. This will help prevent blood clots from forming during exercise. And take it easy and sleep when tired, so you don't get headaches. Remember to do these things even though they seem like common sense!","The primary goal of treatment is to relieve the symptoms caused by MS, such as pain and stiffness. Some people can have some relief from anti-inflammatory drugs while other treatments may be needed to control any side effects that may occur.

What about corticosteroids?

Corticosteroid medications are used to treat inflammation in the joints and muscles in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA). They help reduce inflammation and restore function. Corticosteroids should not replace a healthy diet. If you experience severe joint swelling or worsening of symptoms, it's best to seek medical care for further evaluation.

What should I do if I've had multiple sclerosis before?

If your doctor has ordered tests to check your immune system function, they'll likely order these too. Your doctor will also want to know how long you've been sick, what specific symptoms were present at first, and whether there was a family history of MS.","I have had MS for a total of 23 years now and I am still here. The only way is to be mentally strong, work hard, eat right and live life to the fullest!

Q: What's your advice for young people who want to become doctors/doctors/lawyers/engineers or whatever profession you may choose in the future?\nAnswer: Find what is fun about medicine and do it with passion. I wish I knew that when I was younger.

Q: Is there anything else you'd like readers to know?\nAnswer: My mother had MS but she always did things differently than me. She took medication first, never went on vacation (I think we were all allowed one holiday each year) and made sure everyone around her knew how much she cared for them. As an adult with MS, she taught me patience and respect for others; she was also my best friend until the end. Now I take care of myself and try to make other people happy. I hope this can help someone out there.

What Is Multiple Sclerosis (MS)?\u00a0The most common form of MS is called relapsing-remitting or progressive MS (RRMS). It affects 2% to 5% of people over age 50 who have had an MS diagnosis, but it can strike at any age. The two main types are primary progressive and secondary progressive. Most people with RRMS develop it between ages 20 and 40; some experience it earlier, while others later. Most people with RRMS have more severe disability than those without it. A person with RRMS has about 1/4 to 1/2 of his brain devoted to motor functions such as walking, swallowing, talking, dressing, breathing, and moving around. This is usually not enough for independent life. However, there's always a chance that it will improve if the disease is controlled and the body's immune system is restored to normal. Some people do very well after surgery, radiation therapy, immunotherapy treatments, or drugs designed to treat MS. However, many people don't respond to these treatments, or don't get better at all. For some people, however, MS relapse occurs within months rather than years. These individuals often take time to learn to live independently again. Although some people think they've been diagnosed with MS, they're actually dealing with another disease called neurodegenerative disorders, which involve changes in how the nerve cells communicate with one another. Sometimes, these diseases cause problems that affect the nervous system throughout the body, including spinal cord damage and brain shrinkage.


How Does Multiple Sclerosis Affect Your Vision?\u00a0With each flare-up, you might notice reduced vision. You might also see things differently. If your vision isn't right from day to day or if it becomes worse, you should ask your doctor if he thinks you might have MS. He might prescribe medication for you or let you go see an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) for a test of your eyesight. You can also visit www.multiplesclerosis.org for information about local clinics and organizations that provide free medical care for MS."
57,Question: multiple sclerosis stages phases\nAnswer:,"phase 1 is the disease onset, and stage 2 is the progression.

Q: multiple sclerosis symptoms in children\nAnswer: symptoms are often present in infants as young as 6 months of age; however, some cases may be diagnosed at 18 months or older.

Q: Multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment options\nAnswer: There are two main types of MS drugs called TNF blockers and cyclophosphamide for treating relapses. Both medications work by reducing the immune system's ability to attack damaged cells within the central nervous system.

TNF-blocking agents can reduce inflammation around nerve fibers, while cyclophosphamide blocks a protein called CXCL8 that causes cell death.

However, both TNF-blockers and cyclophosphamide have side effects including nausea and vomiting, fatigue, dry mouth, diarrhea, muscle weakness and weight loss.

A different type of medication known as anti-inflammatory drugs has been used since the 1980s to treat MS symptoms. These drugs reduce damage from inflammatory chemicals in the brain and spinal cord by preventing them from causing an inflammatory response. They also decrease nerve cell production of certain proteins that cause neurological problems, such as pain. However, these medicines only control symptoms, not prevent new disease to develop later.

Most patients who receive immunosuppressant drugs do so because they cannot tolerate other treatments. Some experts believe this treatment approach is too aggressive for many people with MS. Others think there is still plenty of room for improvement. For example, they said it might help if doctors started using more tolerable drug regimens.


How much should I take?\nThe best way to determine how much you need is to see your doctor, especially if you have had any unexplained numbness or tingling since your last MRI scan. If you're taking another medicine, it will affect how much of each medicine to take. Also, talk to your doctor about possible interactions with any other medicine you are taking, particularly ones to which you've been allergic or sensitive.


What kinds of tests will my doctor do?\nDoctors commonly order a series of blood tests before beginning treatment. Some tests show whether you have antibodies against your body's own tissues or the abnormal cells that form MS lesions. Your physician will also monitor how well you respond to a variety of medications. This includes asking questions such as: Do I feel tired all day?

Do I have joint pain?

Can I get up when I'm sick? When","yes (4)

Stage 1: neurological symptoms; no vision loss, loss of bowel control, difficulty swallowing. Stage 2: severe weakness/problems walking and balance; problems with speech or comprehension; headaches. The brain may be damaged. Stage 3: paralysis of part of the body; numbness in one side of the body; loss of bladder function. Brain damage is irreversible. A person who has stage 3 MS might not have any symptoms and might be able to live a normal life. If the disease progresses, it may eventually affect your thinking, speaking, seeing, hearing, breathing, and ability to swallow food. Some people develop progressive neuropathy (nerve pain), which causes numbness or tingling on the hands and feet. Many more people develop peripheral neuropathies, such as ataxia, muscle spasms, dysarthria, and blindness. All these things can cause some of the same problems that you experience with MS.

The number of MS-related conditions also continues to grow rapidly. This means there's no way to know how many people will get MS before diagnosis. The most common are type 1 diabetes mellitus, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis, psoriatic arthritis, scleroderma, Lyme disease, Graves' disease, postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic polyneuropathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, interstitial cystitis, fibromyalgia, migraine headache, epilepsy, depression, bipolar disorder, dementia, schizophrenia, irritable bowel syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Parkinson's disease.

What Are the Most Common Symptoms?

Some people with MS report being bothered by a range of physical symptoms that often begin suddenly and become worse over time. These may include joint pains (spasm), blurred vision, trouble moving one leg or arm, headaches, vision problems, memory problems, problems sleeping, mood swings, and depression.

Other Problems With MS That Affect People's Quality of Life Include:

Pain from MS affects about 5% of all adults with MS. It usually starts between 12 months and 24 months after getting the first MS lesion, but it can occur earlier or later depending on what other diseases, medical conditions, genetics, lifestyle choices, age, and the activity level of an individual.

It generally worsens gradually until it reaches a peak at least a year into the disease. Pain lasts longer","no Answer: yes

4. How often do you visit the doctor?

Do you have regular health check-ups or check-up appointments? (A) Yes, I get my own doctor to get medical advice and make sure that I am healthy. (B) No, I go to my family physician for my health care. (C) I have a primary physician. Question: my health and family questions

8. When did you become active politically?

About 20 years ago when I joined a political party, as an activist. Question: why I became politically active

9. Why did you become an MP?

Because I wanted to serve the people, not just myself. I was elected because I worked hard and campaigned vigorously for the best interests of the state. In the process, I met hundreds of talented people and I had opportunities to interact and meet them face to face. The experience has led me to believe that even though we may differ ideologically or point of view, we need each other to move forward to achieve our goals. Question: why I became a politician","yes

Question: Multiple Sclerosis Stage 1 or 2, when is a MS diagnosis? Answer: it takes about 6 months for stage 1 to become positive (the first sign of the disease), and 3-4 years for the second stage. MS symptoms usually appear between the ages of 30 and 50; in some cases, they can begin earlier (stage 0). The average age at which patients are diagnosed with MS is 65, but many have been found to be undiagnosed until their 70s. It's important to know that there is no cure for MS. Treatment focuses on relieving pain, maintaining mobility, keeping symptoms under control, and promoting recovery from illness. For more information please visit www.msfedsupport.org","stage-4, stage-3, and stage-2

Q: What is the relationship between MS and Parkinson's disease? Answer: Both are autoimmune diseases (autoimmune disorders result in immune system destruction of white blood cells). There may be some overlap in symptoms with age (age of onset) being important. Parkinson's disease typically has a younger age of onset than MS; however, MS often occurs at any age for which there is a positive family history, such as an affected parent. There are many similarities between these two conditions including neurodegeneration, inflammation, and myelin damage (as seen on magnetic resonance imaging or MRI), but it is also clear that both MS and PD can occur at different times in your life. Your doctor will have more questions to ask you about this topic. Q: My husband has MS and we recently learned he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease at the end of 2011. When does MS start and when do all other signs and symptoms begin to appear? Answer: As long as you continue to feel better and get a good night sleep, MS does not usually start until 3 years after you first notice a change in your pain, numbness, tingling, weakness or loss of movement in one area of your body. The last sign of MS generally appears 6 months to 2 years after the most recent onset of any symptom. If you experience any additional symptoms during your first few years after diagnosis you should contact your health care provider immediately. Q: I'm wondering if I am pregnant. Is there a way to test me for MS? Would the results help guide the diagnosis? A: It's possible to develop MS before having children. However, current treatment options don't offer much hope for preventing it from happening. Also, there aren't any tests available for detecting women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. This test would only pick up the risk of developing MS once you had kids. It wouldn't necessarily tell whether or not your child will eventually develop MS.

Question: Multiple sclerosis stage 2\nAnswer: Yes, a T2 lesion (i.e., no inflammation).

Question: Multiple sclerosis stage 3\nAnswer: A T3 lesion (i.e., increased inflammation and neurodegeneration) or a T4 lesion (increased inflammation with no neurodegenerative effects).

Question: Multiple sclerosis stage 4\nAnswer: A T5 lesion (no new inflammation or neurodegeneration); a T6 lesion is a rare exception to this rule.

Q11: What are the different types of MS?

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in a brain region called the central nervous system (CNS), including the spinal cord. The term ""autoimmunity"" is usually used to describe how your body mounts an immune response against itself, rather than targeting a foreign substance such as bacteria or viruses.

In addition to the CNS, the immune system can also attack other areas of the body. These include the eyes, skin, joints, lungs, kidneys, liver, bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes and blood vessels. Other parts of the body may be affected by an immune reaction; therefore, it's important for you to know what is normal for your particular area before considering any changes.

The two main forms of MS are progressive MS and relapsing-remitting MS. Both forms have many overlapping symptoms, which makes it difficult to distinguish between them using standard tests. With progressive MS, your symptoms tend to get worse over time while they improve with treatment. Relapses happen when symptoms return.

About 1 in 10 people who experience recurrent attacks of MS eventually develop permanent damage to their nerve cells. Most often this occurs after the first episode of attacks; however, relapses happen frequently even among those who don't develop MS during childhood. In some cases, people who relapse develop long lasting problems in vision, hearing, movement, cognition, balance, bladder function and more.

A single-event MS can occur at any age. But if you develop symptoms within 12 months of another event, your risk of developing an episode increases rapidly. For example, one in three people will have a reoccurrence of their initial attack within five years of their second incident. If you're not sure whether the symptoms from your previous attack were due to the original attack or an additional event, call us at 1-800-829-8872","Multiple sclerosis is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with no known cure. It affects the central nervous system (CNS) and can be divided into four distinct stages: primary, secondary, relapsing-remitting, and secondary progressive. Each stage has its own diagnostic criteria for identifying cases of MS, which we will describe below in more detail.

Q: What is the most common site of MS lesions? Answer: The two main sites are the brain and spinal cord.

Q: Why do people develop multiple sclerosis as adults or later on in life? Answer: Multiple sclerosis may affect someone at any age but usually begins to show up when someone is in their 40s. However, many patients who have had MS since childhood continue to experience symptoms in early adulthood. Most people with MS live with it for about 10 years before developing significant disability.

Q: How does my doctor diagnose multiple sclerosis? Answer: Your doctor will perform an extensive neurological exam, including a thorough physical examination, an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and a blood test called a white cell count. These tests help your doctor find abnormalities in the body's immune response that could indicate multiple sclerosis, such as low levels of antibodies (white blood cells). This test also helps your doctor identify whether you are genetically susceptible to MS or not. Once your doctor makes this diagnosis, he/she will recommend treatment options for you based on your results.

Q: Is there any medication that can prevent progression of my MS? Answer: No drug currently approved by the FDA is available to treat MS. Scientists don't know exactly why some people develop MS while others do not; however, some scientists believe that the genetics of both people and their environment play a role. Some medications, such as corticosteroids, suppress the inflammatory process of MS by reducing the production of antibodies (which cause inflammation) and therefore preventing further damage to the body's tissues. Other medicines, like immunosuppressants, can reduce inflammation without suppressing production of the white blood cells (called B cells) responsible for making the antibody needed to fight off infection in the first place.

Q: Does it matter if I take certain drugs or supplements? Answer: In general, medications taken during pregnancy and lactation or those used during or after surgery aren't likely to harm an unborn baby because these conditions alter hormones associated with cell growth and development. If you're considering taking prescription medicine or a dietary supplement, discuss the risks and benefits with your health care provider before using them.","multiple sclerosis has four types of stages, and each stage is characterized by a different disease process. Multiple sclerosis (MS) begins with the initial brain inflammation. The central nervous system becomes inflamed because of an overactive immune response triggered by an abnormal reaction in the body's own cells called autoimmunity. This inflammation also leads to the death of white blood cells that normally protect against infection. Once this inflammatory process overwhelms the healthy part of the immune system, an autoimmune attack can begin. These ""autoantibodies"" are actually toxins produced by the body's own cell defenses against the foreign substance or material invading the skin or other tissues. Autoimmune reactions can destroy healthy tissue as well as damage the body's own cells. MS occurs when these harmful substances enter the bloodstream and cause damaging antibodies to be made. When they get into the spinal fluid where the nerve fibers originate from, they activate specific nerves throughout the body that send pain signals to your brain. An area called the trigeminal nucleus sends sensory information to the brain about the touch sensation, but not all sensations will trigger a response within the brain. For some people, a particular sense may only react to certain stimuli, like heat or cold. In MS patients, it seems that these triggers become more common.

It is possible for someone who has never had MS to develop the condition later on, after having already been diagnosed with another serious disability or illness such as cardiovascular disease or cancer.

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) has many different names in different countries. Most often, however, people refer to it simply as MS. It affects 1% of Americans age 20-69 years old, but it affects far more than that population. It is estimated that at least half a million Americans have MS. Another estimate puts the number between 800,000 and 2 million. There is no way of knowing how much MS affects other populations because most research so far has focused primarily on people in the United States. Some estimates even say that as many as 10% of the world's total population has MS, meaning that approximately 600 million people around the globe could potentially be affected.","multiple sclerosis stages are usually divided into the following three stages: 1. inflammatory phase; 2. immune-mediated stage; and 3. neurodegenerative stage. (1) inflammation is characterized by uncontrolled release of proteins, cytokines and other substances from cells, which may cause an increase in proinflammatory enzymes such as COX-2 and IL-6; this leads to a cascade of events leading to cell death or tissue damage. This can occur via either apoptosis (programmed cell death), necrosis (death without cell death) or invasion of the central nervous system into brain tissues. There are many factors involved with various types of MS (e.g., type of T cell receptor that the cell expresses, duration of the disease, number of neurons damaged at one time point and so on). It is believed that a single factor cannot be responsible for most types of MS. (2) Immune mediated is thought to represent a major part of multiple sclerosis pathology. In fact, immunological changes in the CNS can lead to the onset of MS. However, it is unclear whether autoimmune destruction of myelin sheaths and/or myelination is more frequent in patients with progressive versus relapsing forms of MS. These findings suggest that some of these changes can be initiated during or after the first episode of the disease. (3) Neurodegeneration represents a new aspect of multiple sclerosis since the initial focus was on immune involvement in MS. The role of neurotrophic factors has been studied mainly through their effect on oligodendrocytes, microglia and astrocytes and their regulation. Although there is evidence suggesting that some of these effects have a direct impact on the initiation of symptoms in different phases of MS, it is also possible that alterations of neuronal development might be responsible. Nevertheless, neurodegenerative changes occurring early in the course of multiple sclerosis appear to play a critical role in the progression of the disease and result in a significant loss of function in the motor circuits of the brain.

The disease appears to change according to its stage of occurrence, i.e. the incidence of relapse increases at higher levels of severity (see below). This suggests that the disease is not fixed but dynamic in nature.

What Is A Relapse?

In MS, the body's defense mechanisms fail due to an imbalance between the amount of abnormal white blood cells and the number of healthy ones in the peripheral blood. This results in the formation of antibodies against all white blood cells present in the periphery","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive disease of the nervous system that causes destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, resulting in weakness, numbness or paralysis.

The disease is considered to be one of multiple sclerosis's many manifestations because it affects different parts of the body; each stage represents an area where MS patients are experiencing symptoms.

In MS, the immune system attacks myelin sheath around nerves fibers, which results in sensory loss, fatigue, pain, difficulty with speech, vision problems, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and cognitive dysfunction.

Multiple sclerosis may also result from a problem with blood vessels and tissue within the brain. The condition can cause significant disability, though only about 1 out of every 4 people who have MS will develop clinical signs of the disease.

It's estimated that nearly 1 million Americans, or 11% of all adults, have MS. It most commonly affects women between 40 and 55 years old. Most cases occur in those ages 25-44, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

Other conditions that share characteristics with MS include chronic kidney disease, epilepsy, Crohn's Disease, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.

About 90 percent of people with MS experience some degree of impairment, whether mild or severe, but there isn't a cure for this common neurodegenerative disorder. Some treatments available today help manage symptoms, while others remain experimental."
58,Question: Risk to develop multiple sclerosis\nAnswer:,"Yes

Q: Would this increase my risk of developing cancer? Answer: Probably not, but it is possible.

Q: Can I drink coffee while taking this medication? Answer: No. You can only take the drug at a low dose for its anti-inflammatory effects and only if you have no other symptoms or side effects that interfere with the ability to function safely. Taking any form of caffeine during your treatment could lead to unpleasant withdrawal symptoms in some people. There are many other drugs that you should avoid while on CIMT or any other type of immune suppressive therapy.

Risks for People With Other Medical Conditions

People who have diabetes, heart disease, liver problems, kidney problems, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), HIV infection, thyroid dysfunction, leukemia or leukemia treatment, epilepsy, sickle cell disease, brain tumors, glaucoma, high cholesterol levels or other serious medical conditions may need to be cautious about taking the drug or avoiding certain foods and drinks. Discuss these risks with your doctor before using CIMT. If you do decide to use this medicine, talk to your doctor about how long it will stay in your body and when you should stop taking it.","Yes; (see section 5.1).


Q: Is the risk of developing MS reduced by smoking?

A: No, it is not. It may have a small reduction in some people, but there are other factors that contribute and this does not change the overall picture.


What about other environmental factors such as diet, physical activity, or sun exposure? Most of these can affect the risk of developing MS. The question should be asked on the basis of studies which use data from populations where people do not smoke, drink alcohol or take drugs. Such studies cannot tell us what happens if you are exposed to some chemical agents, such as asbestos.


Q: How safe is the current standard of care for treating patients with MS?

A: Many doctors see the results of clinical trials to decide whether to recommend treatment with new medications. The results can differ depending on who takes part in the study. In general, they find that the risks of side effects are lower than the benefits, and most think that the use of new medicines poses too great a risk to benefit outweighs their potential benefits.


For example, taking aspirin reduces the chance of having a heart attack by 25 percent; however, this has been shown to increase the chances of death from all causes. Taking an aspirin daily lowers your risk of cancer by 20 percent. But, this also increases your chances of dying of lung cancer; so one would expect the net benefit of taking aspirin to be less than its cost. Aspirin probably makes you feel better, but does not reduce the likelihood of getting a serious illness.


The same goes for most new drugs. A few of them do offer significant improvement over existing treatments. For example, statins reduce blood cholesterol levels by 15-20 percent, reducing the risk of heart attacks, strokes and some cancers. However, the large majority of people treated with statins suffer side effects such as nausea, constipation, dizziness and abdominal pain. Some patients need long courses of medicine. One could argue that if the side effects of statins were worse, more people would choose them. This seems unlikely given that many patients have no problems with statins at all.","Yes

Q. What are the symptoms of MS?\r

A. Symptoms include numbness and tingling in one or both legs, blurred vision, problems with balance, problems walking, loss of voice and speech (hypersensitivity pneumonitis), vision changes, stiffness, pain in joints (arthritis) or muscles (spondyloarthropathy), muscle weakness, fatigue, sleep difficulties, skin conditions, hearing problems (peripheral neuropathy) and tremors.

Q. How is MS diagnosed?\r

A. There have been a number of different ways to diagnose MS. In recent years there has been much interest in using new MRI techniques, which can look at patterns of inflammation and damage in the brain. However this technology has not yet been widely used in England.

Q. Is there a cure for MS?\r

A. Not likely to be. Current treatments aim to manage symptoms. People who may benefit from treatment include people with type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus, those taking aspirin, certain groups of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, women with breast cancer, people with HIV infection, and people with multiple sclerosis.","You have a genetic predisposition for MS. It can be from inherited or acquired, and it is most common in those who are carriers of the gene for MS (sickle cell).

Q: What is an autoimmune disease?

A: An autoimmune disease means your body's immune system attacks itself when it detects certain proteins that you produce inside cells called white blood cells. If enough of these proteins are produced, they can damage your internal organs, such as your heart, lungs, brain or kidneys. This attack could lead to severe problems including joint pain or other symptoms like flu-like illnesses, weakness, fatigue and depression.","Not known.

Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder that affects nerve cells in the brain and nervous system

Multiple chemical sensitivities (involving exposure to chemicals such as benzene)

Trauma or chronic illness

A second cause is:

Neurological diseases including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and more

Migraine headaches (which also affect the central nervous system)

Other conditions can cause an individual to be misdiagnosed with MS, including:

Rheumatoid arthritis, which may mimic other forms of MS and make it hard to distinguish from others

Arthritis due to viral infections

Anemia due to severe vitamin deficiencies

Infections resulting in pneumonia or meningitis

Acute stress

Stress-related seizures

Some people who have been misdiagnosed with MS include:

Those with a family history of MS

People whose symptoms appear at a younger age

Women who have had their first pregnancy while they were pregnant with another child

Children and adolescents under 18 years old who have not seen a doctor regularly throughout their lives

For many, the diagnosis of MS does not come easily, but doctors know how to spot early signs of the condition. Most important, patients should see their primary care physician if they suspect they may have MS.","High risk

The risk of developing MS is increased by high exposure to environmental toxins and chemicals (called ""toxins"") found in the environment, such as lead, mercury, pesticides, heavy metals, radon, asbestos, or solvents. In fact, several studies have shown that these substances are associated with an increased incidence of MS.[3] The risk of developing MS increases dramatically at levels much higher than those which are considered safe. For example, a study conducted by Dr. James C. Hormone Jr., PhD, has demonstrated that even low levels of mercury can result in a substantial increase in the chance of MS development.[4] This may be because there are many more free radicals produced when lead particles interact with DNA compared to mercury vapor, which can increase the chances of damage to proteins and other biological molecules. Furthermore, it should also be noted that long-term exposure to lead causes irreversible nerve cell death through oxidative stress. It's important to note that some people who have suffered from MS will not develop this disease until they reach adulthood or beyond, while others will have symptoms within a few years after beginning their careers.

Dietary Restrictions

Q: Can I limit my consumption of certain foods? A: Dietary restrictions are possible for those individuals who suffer from Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However, eating poorly or avoiding certain foods has been shown to contribute to muscle atrophy. Eating healthy and exercising regularly are essential aspects of managing MS. Many experts recommend limiting your caloric intake and consuming adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals daily. For instance, one article states that a person needs 3,000 milligrams of vitamin D per day to prevent deficiency in the future.[5] One study reported that individuals who consumed fewer than 775 milligrams of calcium per day were 50% more likely to develop MS.[6] The most effective way to reduce the risk of MS is through proper nutrition. If you do decide to restrict your diet, make sure that you stay hydrated, eat healthy food choices, and don't smoke to avoid secondhand cigarette smoke. There are plenty of vegetarian options available, including mushrooms, spinach, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and collard greens. Avoid eating too many carbohydrates; instead, choose foods rich in protein and fat. Avoid alcohol as well if you suffer from MS. Alcoholic beverages, particularly wine and beer, contain toxic substances that can harm the nervous system. Other suggestions include drinking water or soft drinks during your meal break. Also, consume small","I had MS for 14 years before my last episode.

Q: What's the worst thing you've done that could have caused MS? Answer: I'm really not sure, but it probably included a bicycle accident as a child, which led to two cracked vertebrae and left me with paralysis of my shoulder blade and neck. The most dangerous time in my life was when I started smoking. Smoking is now pretty much stopped, but back then I smoked every day without stopping! Q: When did you first know you were affected by MS? Answer: My mother died of MS in her early twenties. She was 45 at death. A few months later my father also developed MS. In both cases my father had been diagnosed with MS since childhood but had had no symptoms or progression until his late 30s.


When did you first start having trouble walking? Answer: I began to become ill around age 15. At this point I used to walk for short distances on the weekends. By age 17 I started working long hours, which made my legs tired, so I would get up from sitting in front of the TV and walk half way around my home (about 500m) to the car where we lived. It took me about three weeks each week to do this. This was very tiring - especially because during these walks I didn't sleep well or eat enough. So I gradually increased the distance I walked each week - often to 100-200m. By my mid 20s I was running about an hour everyday. These changes meant my body was more active than normal, therefore my joints were feeling worse and worse. Eventually, in my early 30s, I went to see a GP who referred me to a neurologist. He diagnosed me with Multiple Sclerosis (MS).


How does your daily routine differ from most people?

I walk for longer periods than most people do, including long jogs after work. And when I get home, my usual routine involves driving myself to a local supermarket, returning home, eating lunch at home, going to bed and waking up again at 9am, usually to drive myself there again. Then I go to school or work. Most days I don't get to run more than a mile. But sometimes I'll be forced to drive a couple of times before I can get out of my driveway. Q: How many miles per week do you run, and how far are they? Answer: I normally run at least one marathon a year. There's nothing like the rush","Yes

Q. What is the most common cause of long-term neurological sequelae following an organ transplant? Answer: autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) or infection caused by a virus, bacterium, parasite, protozoa (such as roundworms), or fungus. These are the two main causes of chronic neuropathies and complications following organ transplants. The incidence rates for rheumatoid arthritis may be 30 to 50 times higher than that for organ transplant recipients; it can result in extensive scarring. For example, in one large study, about 20% of rheumatoid patients developed new manifestations of their disease within 5 years after receiving a kidney from a donor with systemic lupus erythematosus. In contrast, 2% of transplant recipients developed new signs or symptoms related to their transplant within 5 years.[7]

The risk of developing acute renal failure (ARF) is increased in the first year after a transplant and more so after each subsequent transplant. ARFs have been reported in 60%-80% of transplant recipients who develop chronic neurologic complications (i.e., cognitive deficits). Some studies show that ARFs occur at much lower rates among patients who received organ transplants than those who did not receive transplants.[8] It has also been suggested that some of these diseases might become progressive over time, which could make them difficult to control with current antiretroviral treatment strategies.[9]

Treatment options include a number of different drugs used to treat HIV. Among these medications are several approved for use as anti-retrovirals (ARTs)—antiretroviral therapies that suppress the immune system by interfering with viral replication—and others approved only for treating opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis and influenza. As part of ART regimens, patients are given immunosuppressive medication to decrease their CD4+ cell count. This decreases the amount of blood cells available for the body's natural defense against invading pathogens. Antibiotic therapy (often oral) is often added to prevent secondary bacterial infections. Patients typically remain on anti-HIV meds for life if they have no other treatment.

In addition to taking ART drugs, many patients will also receive antiviral medications called protease inhibitors that inhibit HIV's ability to replicate and infect cells. Proteases destroy the HIV genome during normal HIV infection but are necessary for HIV to reproduce once infected. Patients undergoing surgery or cancer chemotherapy must take this medication because its effect does","no (some data)

The likelihood of progression depends on how long you have had it and when it started; if you don't begin treatment at an early stage, your chances are higher of a relapse or worse outcome.The chance that a person will develop MS does not increase over time. Even people who have had their first MS attack before they're 50 are still at high risk of developing the disease later in life.

Q: What happens to my body during treatment?Answer: the main goal of treatment is to prevent symptoms by suppressing nerve cells so that they can no longer produce enough inflammatory chemicals that cause inflammation and damage. In some cases, this may involve drugs called anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). NSAID medications work by reducing the amount of a certain type of protein produced by nerve cells called cyclooxygenase enzymes. Cytokines also help explain what appears to be a common side effect: stomach problems in many patients taking NSAIDS.

Q: Are there any other risks associated with treating MS? Answer: Yes, even in patients who don't develop severe disability from MS, side effects such as heart problems and stroke, and blood clots may occur. These can be serious, but they're generally mild and self-limiting.

Q: How much do I need to take each day for the best results? Answer: There isn't one dose, but doctors usually recommend starting treatment with either low doses of 400 mg of ibuprofen (Advil) every four hours for two days to see whether the medicines' benefits last or not. If they don't, it's probably safe to continue taking lower doses until your doctor tells you otherwise. You'll use the same amount of medication all throughout the course of treatment — sometimes less, sometimes more. It may take several weeks to find out exactly how much to take — and then adjust your regimen accordingly. Your doctor will discuss how often to change up the dosages, since different people respond differently to these treatments.

Q: Should I stop taking the pills?Answer: It's unlikely you'll get better without stopping treatment, especially since your immune system doesn't naturally make its own medicine like yours does. That said, there's always the possibility that the medicines might interfere with a future autoimmune reaction, or your body could go into remission once you've been treated. So keep trying, even after you stop taking them.","When you are a young adult with MS, your risk of getting the disease is very small. But over time, as your body breaks down and builds up scar tissue, it's more likely to make mistakes in its own repair processes that can lead to secondary diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or other autoimmune disorders. Your chance of developing another autoimmune disorder also increases as you age. If you have been diagnosed with MS or an autoimmune condition before age 40, your chances increase even further by 50 percent.

If you're already at high risk for becoming ill with one of these conditions, talking about your health concerns with someone who understands how the immune system works can help protect you from problems and give you hope for better outcomes.","It is a well established fact that multiple sclerosis (MS) has no known cure. Multiple Sclerosis affects approximately 1 in 500 people over the age of 50 and there are currently no effective treatments for this disease. Approximately 80% of MS patients will develop relapses of symptoms, which may be progressive or relapsing. Because relapse can occur at any point in the disease course and often occurs within months, MS patients are advised to continue taking their medication even when they feel better. If you have MS and have not had an episode of full blown remission yet, then it is best to monitor your progress with regular checkups and treatment as needed.

Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Options

There are currently three types of drug treatments available in the US: corticosteroids (prednisone), interferon beta (Avastin), and glatiramer acetate (Gleevec). The primary goal of these drugs is to prevent relapses of MS symptoms by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cells called myelin basic protein. By blocking this, MS patients can return to normal activity and recovery after a flare up of symptoms. In addition, these drugs reduce inflammation and increase white blood cell count. This helps keep the body healthy as a whole. Although this type of therapy does provide some relief from pain and other side effects, long term use of steroids can cause damage to bone marrow tissue. Also, doctors do recommend avoiding these drugs until all side effects have been resolved. However, if you are having severe joint pain or other problems such as blurred vision, dizziness, or depression then you should take caution in taking steroid medications.

Corticosteroids – Prednisone (dexamethasone) and Interferon Beta (Adalimumab)

This class of drugs is used to treat acute inflammation associated with an infection or autoimmune diseases like MS. They also block the release of white blood cells so that MS patients do not produce additional immune responses. Corticosteroid therapy causes an improvement in physical function, fatigue, swelling, and pain while reducing neurological symptoms such as numbness or tingling in extremities.

Interferon Beta (Avastin)

This type of medicine targets several different areas of the nervous system causing an imbalance between the active and inactive ingredients. These imbalance results in abnormal production of the substance interleukin 2 (IL2). Avastin blocks IL2 activity preventing the activation of myelin. The result of this is that patients see a","No answer

Q. What is the probability of developing MS?

A. It depends on age. The risk increases as you get older, until it peaks at 30 years old and then falls off dramatically. For example, in a study of 11,000 people with average age of 40, there was one incident case of MS per 100,000 person-years. In another study involving almost 20,000 people, there were 1,300 cases per 100,000 person-years. An estimate of the number of new MS patients in the United States during the 1990s is 3 million to 5 million.

The main findings from this study were that there was a positive correlation between the duration of cannabis use and the risk of MS. In addition, the findings showed that the overall cumulative exposure to cannabis users (perceived) increased with increasing duration of use and that the cumulative dose per person could be used as an indicator of cumulative risks of developing MS. The results are consistent with those reported by other researchers who have studied the relationship between smoking cannabis and MS in different populations [2]. The authors concluded that ""the present data suggest that the presence of at least one lifetime episode of cannabis use is associated with an increased incidence of MS"". Furthermore they stated that ""the current findings should not lead to the conclusion that it is safe or advisable for people to smoke cannabis as a daily habit without regard to its possible effect on human health"" [8]. This report has been challenged by some researchers because although it does show that the prevalence of heavy cannabis use was higher among patients with MS than healthy controls, the authors had failed to examine whether the association was causal, which is critical in determining causality. Other studies have looked into the causal nature of the association but have found no convincing evidence of causation either way; instead, they have indicated that both genetic and environmental factors are likely involved [1,3,4]

Conclusion: The results of our study do indicate an association between cannabis use and the development of MS. It also appears that many of these symptoms may be caused by another disease process such as rheumatoid arthritis rather than being directly due to cannabis use. However, there is still some ambiguity about the mechanism whereby cannabis causes MS since we did not find any direct link between cannabis use and immune responses. Further research is needed to establish this hypothesis.","1) yes 2) no Answer: 2)

Note that the answer ""no"" is in the negative column, because the question did not ask about possible risks of an increased risk of MS. Thus we would expect a small increase in the incidence of this disorder for people who have had their spines removed, but the risk associated with having a spine surgery is still small compared to other possible health risks (such as getting cancer).

Q10. In addition to being able to use your legs or feet more easily, do you feel better if they are shorter?

A: Yes, I am much less worried about my ability to move around now, and it's very relaxing.

Q11. Do you find exercise difficult or easy? A: Easy!

Q12. Do you spend time thinking about work? B: I try to think more about work, but sometimes I can't concentrate on anything. It doesn't bother me too much though.

Q13. Have you been in a relationship before? If so, how long were you married? How long did you live together? C: 10 years

D: 20 years

E: 30 years

F: 40 years

G: 50+ years

H: Never answered Answer: E = never; H = never lived together; F = divorced/divorced

Note that the answers to questions 11 and 12 are always positive for these respondents. This is because the participants are asked whether the length of their marriages has been longer than ten years, which corresponds well with the average lifespan in the United States (about fifty-eight years). The length of marriage was also measured at two points during the respondents' lives (one point when the respondent first got married, and another point when he or she moved out of the marital home), which gives us some information on the duration of their previous relationships. In contrast, the responses on question 13 indicate that the respondents knew each other for only five years prior to this interview. Thereby we can assume that the respondents may have been involved in many different kinds of relationships prior to marrying. As a result of this, we cannot be certain that these respondents really had been dating since high school, since the frequency of such dating events was unknown. Therefore, we chose to interpret the results from question 14 as indicating that this participant had been in a romantic relationship for only five years.

The results reported in Q15 tell another story. These researchers found that the length"
62,"Question: disclosing multiple sclerosis at work, how will colleagues react?\nAnswer:","This can be very hard to deal with. You may have a lot of support from your supervisor or manager but it can get uncomfortable when you are in the position where other people know your situation and don't really understand what is going on. I would recommend that it's better if you keep quiet about MS and wait until it gets worse before coming out about it, then talk with them about it. If they're supportive and understanding, then fine; if not... well then, you just need to find someone else who understands MS. It doesn't matter what type of job this is, whether it involves physical labor or something more creative like writing, I always make sure there is a great diversity of people working with me. In my opinion, everyone should try to keep their mind open when they are learning new information so it doesn't limit them in the future.

I am currently undergoing an intensive treatment for multiple sclerosis at University Hospital in Toronto. My condition has progressed over the last 6 months to the point where my eyesight deteriorates rapidly, my speech becomes slurred (which I didn't realize I had), my body aches, and I feel increasingly tired all day long. As a result, my employer, The Canadian Institute for Health Information, has recently announced that they will no longer provide health insurance coverage for those affected by MS. They also stated that my treatment must take precedence over any other medical care that I receive as an employee. My condition requires daily medication (medication that costs around $3,000 per month) as part of my treatment regimen. The cost of these medications is paid for by MY paycheque which has already been cut down drastically in recent years due to low employment rates among First Nations people. The cost of this medication alone would run up towards $15,000 a year. Because I am unable to pay for this kind of drug, I rely entirely upon my disability payments to fund my treatments. Currently, the monthly income from my disability check is approximately $2,400 - which amounts to less than 30% of my annual salary. Even though we live in Canada and work under Canadian laws, I fear the ramifications for our personal finances and career prospects. Will this affect my ability to continue to qualify for benefits and jobs across Canada? What does this mean for my family financially? How do we survive without MS coverage? In order to protect myself financially, I believe it is important for me to publicly disclose my diagnosis. I hope that others who are experiencing similar circumstances will share their experiences so that we","I have had people who thought they were not taking advantage of my condition; however, once I told them about my MS diagnosis and the fact that it affects my daily life, their attitude changed and many are now talking to me about it. This is an example of why you should disclose your MS to everyone, especially if you are a manager or supervisor.

Question: Do you still take medication for your MS when out of the office and away from work? \NAnswer: Yes, currently I do but am considering switching to a different medication in the future if there is no improvement.


Question: How important is it to tell patients about the symptoms of MS and what causes MS?\ nAnswer: The more information we can give a patient about his/her symptoms, the easier it will be for him/her to realize there may be something wrong with his body. I try to explain that people do not get sick because of their genes; rather, diseases like MS happen because the body's natural immune system does not respond properly. We also stress the importance of having regular check ups by doctors.


Question: What type of treatment do you recommend?\NAnswer: Medication is our first line of defense against this disease. A diet rich in vitamin D (approximately 800 IU per day) also helps improve the function of the muscles and joints. Exercise can help decrease pain, inflammation and stiffness. While most treatments such as physical therapy (taping), massage, acupuncture, cortisone injections, electrical stimulation and other types of therapies are not very effective, I strongly encourage patients to participate in any other exercise program provided.

Question: What kind of reaction did you receive when you disclosed your MS?\nAnswer: One colleague was supportive initially and then she became upset and even cried after some time, saying ""I never knew"" and that I ""didn't talk to her enough."" At one point, one co-worker asked me to leave, which I refused. However, other people seemed to understand and some joked with me, others were impressed and a few said they would ""be careful around"" me. After some time passed, I started getting a lot of positive feedback from coworkers and friends, and the reactions were much better than before. When discussing this topic with co-workers over dinner one night, someone mentioned that he hadn't been able to come into work for several years because of back problems, so the idea that his doctor could prescribe medication made him feel better.

Question: If I","if they don't, you should tell them. If they do have concerns, it's your choice whether or not to address them. You may want to include some of the following:

Describe your job, and describe what you like about it.

Tell them about any current symptoms that might be affecting your ability to perform this job safely.

Explain that MS is often a long-term condition and that you'll need to remain on medications for the rest of your life.

State that you're considering retiring at some point in the future because you feel more prepared now than ever before to stay healthy.

Tell them how much you appreciate their support during your recovery.

You can discuss with your supervisor any questions they have regarding your medical history and treatment options. In addition, you are encouraged to speak with your employer's human resources department so that you know when and where to report any conditions or difficulties that arise.","They'll think you're a total idiot.

Q5: What are some of the biggest challenges to working with MS patients?\nAnswer: They don't always see eye-to-eye on things. I have had to break up arguments between my wife and my father who is a very vocal advocate for MS.

They also think that the disclosure is not a big deal since this information can be obtained for free via medical records or from other sources. However, another colleague has expressed concern that he/she may lose their job if they were to be outed by having MS in the workplace as it affects productivity, health insurance premiums, etc. It's too early to tell what kind of impact this has on my career, but I'm trying to be proactive in protecting myself and my family as much as possible.

Q: My employer has an internal policy against revealing someone's diagnosis or disability history when hiring them, though there's no specific mention of MS in the policy (or any similar policies). I was wondering if this could have implications if the individual in question also has a mental illness? Is it possible for employers to discriminate based on a person's mental illness without the employee being aware?\r


\n Answer: As far as I know, there are no written policies prohibiting employers from asking about mental illnesses in employment interviews; however, if you do ask questions about such things (e.g., ""Have you ever been diagnosed with a mental disorder?""), make sure your answers aren't phrased defensively. For example, saying you haven't had treatment might mean nothing if you're being asked about treatment for a recent relapse after some time off. If something does come up during the interview process that is relevant to your application, discuss this with HR and try to resolve the situation so that nobody feels harassed.

If you feel uncomfortable with this issue going forward, talk to a lawyer because federal law prohibits discrimination based on disability if a person receives preferential consideration. In order to protect yourself, try to keep these issues away from supervisors until the final stage of the hiring process. Also, don't be afraid to ask for clarification on an ambiguous reference. Don't let this discourage you -- you should be able to get references provided by friends, relatives or former coworkers. Also, remember that people sometimes have a tendency to lie about disabilities or conditions if they fear losing their livelihoods. You never want to take on a personal responsibility you can't handle.

More information about MS","they'll be very concerned that you have multiple sclerosis. I was told not to bring it up in my social circle even though it's an illness everyone should know about.

Q: What is your biggest fear for the future of MS research? Answer: There aren't many treatments left for me and there won't be any therapies available anytime soon. The only thing we can do now is find new ways of treating the disease and hopefully preventing its progression.

Q: Is MS a life sentence or something you can live with?\nAnswer: It depends on which symptoms I get. If I don't feel well enough to go out then there isn't much point in living; if I'm really sick but still able to look after myself then I might be able to cope. My mother had a stroke when she was young so being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis hasn't been easy but I've found coping quite difficult.

""I just want people to understand that this disease affects all of us. We're not different from one another, each one of us has a brain disorder.""

Michele Smith-Spangler is a freelance journalist based in London","they will be shocked.

Some of them may not know what MS is and have no idea that they are affected by it. Others may think you have a broken arm or leg - and it's okay to let them do this because they'll just get over it in time.

Most people with MS have lost some function and cannot walk for extended periods of time and therefore, have very limited social life and work experience. However, we don't have many options when it comes to work-related disabilities. The last thing that someone who has been diagnosed with MS needs is for their employers to take away what little independence they still have. We've already seen examples where people have been told that their disability means they can only wear high heels on the job. And if you're disabled as a result of being born with Down syndrome then perhaps your employers should give you an easier working environment so that you can enjoy more independence. There have been times during my career when I've had to leave jobs early due to illness but I was always given plenty of support when I returned from maternity leave. My employer supports me fully through everything that goes wrong, including getting back into work. So why shouldn't other people have the same level of reassurance about what their future looks like?

It is important to note that although there are a lot of good reasons why it would be reasonable to ask employees if they are affected by MS at work, it could also cause great distress and upset to employees. If you want to avoid causing distress and upsetting people while supporting those who are affected by MS at work, remember that the law does allow you to ask people whether or not they have MS but only if it is relevant to the task at hand.","they have a lot of respect for me.\r

""The only thing I can do is to continue with my job and just try to be as normal as possible.""","Many people are surprised and shocked when they discover you have MS. I am not surprised because I had many conversations with my coworkers who were also surprised to learn about the disease. It is very common that people don't know or understand about this.

I've heard from more than one person, ""Oh wow! So you're a doctor now?"" A few were skeptical but others thought it was interesting and wanted to find out more information. The good news is most people did not seem to be too concerned for their own safety. Some took it as an opportunity to connect on a deeper level and to share personal stories of personal struggles that contributed to MS. Others shared similar concerns regarding workplace wellness programs. However, there was some concern over employers providing benefits based on MS diagnoses rather than other conditions. One employer asked me if I would want to consider taking time off or being let go from my job due to MS. While I do understand the need to provide workers health care coverage, those types of policies typically exclude any type of pre-existing condition.

What's next for you after receiving your Master of Science in Epidemiology degree? My PhD research interests lie in identifying risk factors associated with MS, including lifestyle behaviors, environmental exposures (such as air pollution), genetics, and genetic variation. This has implications for public health policy efforts such as regulating smoking cessation programs, which can affect the likelihood of developing MS, as well as controlling population growth.

63,Question: Will multiple sclerosis affect my career?\nAnswer:,"Yes. Multiple sclerosis affects the nervous system, causing damage to nerves and muscles that can be debilitating for those who are affected by this disease. You may also have problems with your vision, hearing, or motor coordination, among other things. It is a serious condition, and it should not prevent you from doing all of your normal work activities.

Q: What kind of MS treatments do I need?

A: There is no cure for multiple sclerosis (MS). The best way to help people with MS improve their quality of life is through treatment. However, there are many different types of MS treatments that may help control symptoms and slow progression of the disease.

Treatment options include medication, physical therapy, electrotherapy, sensory integration therapies (SITs), cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs), eye movements, spinal cord stimulation, and surgery. Some treatments, such as nerve blocks, can cause side effects, so doctors will give careful consideration before prescribing them to you. Sometimes you will start a new type of treatment after having been on an old one. For example, if you were treated with nerve blocks and then began a new drug that suppresses neuroblasts, you would begin using the new drug while taking the original ones.

Q: How long does it take to get better?

A: Most people experience some improvement in their symptoms within weeks or months after starting a new treatment plan. In more severe cases, people may require longer periods between treatments. Even if you don't feel better right away, you can expect to regain mobility and function eventually.

Q: Should my family members know about my current medical conditions?

A: Your care team will tell everyone involved that you are getting treatment for multiple sclerosis. They should keep in touch with you about changes in your symptoms and progress, even though you might not show any obvious change. Family members also can provide support for you during your rehabilitation, including helping with household tasks such as cooking or cleaning.

Q: What happens next?

A: After you receive your diagnosis, you'll probably get an MRI scan to find out where in your body your disease is affecting. This will allow your doctor to determine whether or not you are at risk for developing MS relapse. If so, your doctor will prescribe medications that may reverse the symptoms. Doctors often use two tests to make these decisions — a skin-prick test to detect areas that are inflamed, and a spinal tap to look for evidence of spinal fluid leaking into","It depends. Your doctor and your employer determine what is best for you to do with MS at this time. If you are in a high-risk group (e.g., those who have recently had an amputation or spinal cord injury), it could be difficult for you to find work, but you should not give up hope just because of the possibility. Achieving independence from your disease will take time and hard work.

Achieving independence from your disease will take time and hard work. Q: How does multiple sclerosis impact the quality of life?\nAnswer: Multiple sclerosis affects many aspects of daily life – including your ability to communicate, interact socially, manage relationships, and maintain personal hygiene and appearance. These factors can be reduced when MS symptoms are managed effectively by your health care team and/or other people who live with you. However, some people may experience significant limitations due to their disability, including social isolation, inability to participate in social activities, difficulty making decisions about personal care, and limited involvement in community life. This may make the individual feel isolated or depressed. For example, if someone has both chronic fatigue syndrome and MS, they may face considerable difficulties finding employment as a result of social stigma associated with the combination of symptoms. Some people also report feeling trapped in their own bodies, with no way out, even though they know there is something more than what they see on the outside. People living with multiple sclerosis often suffer from significant stressors related to their condition; however, there is no cure for MS, so managing these stressors is important to maintaining well-being. For individuals with moderate to severe MS, life may become increasingly complex and challenging through the onset and worsening of symptoms. You may require assistance with mobility, balance, speech, vision, and sensory function. You may need specialized equipment that may include a wheelchair, a walker, or a cane for assistance in walking around your home or workplace. The physical demands of everyday tasks (such as shopping) may increase significantly for people living with MS. The medical management and medication used during this phase may involve changes in diet, exercise, and medications. Other costs, such as copayments for healthcare services,","Yes. Multiple sclerosis affects all aspects of your life, including your career choices and the ability to work in a particular field. If you have MS, it's likely that you'll need some form of treatment for your condition at one point or another over your lifetime. However, there are several ways to manage MS-related problems so you can continue working, live as normally as possible, and get compensated appropriately during this time.

How is Multiple Sclerosis Treated?\nAnswer: The treatment options available vary depending on your diagnosis. Depending on your level of disability, you may receive either corticosteroid therapy (such as prednisone), an injectable drug (for example, prednisolone injection) or a combination of both. Your doctor will discuss these treatments with you and decide what works best for you. In addition to your medical care, you'll want to make sure you're taking medicines properly—both for treating MS itself, as well as for managing its symptoms. For more information about the treatment you might receive, see How is Multiple Sclerosis Treated?

What if I'm not able to pay for treatment?

Some people with MS who don't qualify for special Medicare insurance because they aren't disabled are forced into government assistance programs such as Medicaid. These programs allow them to stay at home, receive help getting jobs, and find food to eat while receiving treatment. While it isn't guaranteed that you'll qualify for Medicaid, there are steps you can take to prepare yourself for this possibility.

How do I apply for Medicaid?

If you can't afford to pay for MS treatment out-of-pocket, you may be eligible for Medicaid. You must contact your state's health department to find out whether or not your state participates in Medicaid. To find out more about how to apply for Medicaid, visit Medi-Cal.gov. Or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-622-4357). Also ask your doctor about other options you may consider, such as paying for services through a private provider. Some states offer financial assistance through their healthcare programs; others simply give patients free coverage. Learn more about this program here.","Yes, MS can be a major impediment to work. The best way to minimize this is to get as much time off as possible, which may mean working in other fields for the first several years after diagnosis.

Q2: How long do I have before symptoms start appearing?\nAnswer: The most common initial signs of MS are numbness and tingling (sometimes called ""somatosensory"" or ""myalgic"" pain) at rest, particularly on one side of your body. These are typically felt only when you're sitting still and do not occur during activity. However, these symptoms tend to worsen over the course of days, weeks, months, and even years. Eventually, patients with MS report more widespread nerve damage from repeated exposure to nerves in their legs, back, arms, hands, feet, etc., leading them to feel ""pins and needles"" in those areas. Symptoms also usually appear within 2-3 months after a person develops symptoms of multiple sclerosis. By that point, the condition has probably progressed significantly since the beginning, and many people find it difficult to walk independently again. They might still lose weight but will still need assistance moving around, and they'll often experience some level of neurological impairment. People who recover quickly usually never regain full use of all limbs. Even if they eventually regain their ability to move about independently, they might continue to have difficulty walking.

Q3: What treatments exist for MS?\nAnswer: There isn't yet any cure for MS, but there are ways to manage symptoms without medication. In general, doctors prescribe anti-inflammatory medications such as aspirin to reduce inflammation and lower the risk of stroke or heart attack. This type of therapy may help relieve muscle stiffness, weakness, headaches, and fatigue. Other types of drugs include steroids used to treat inflammation or blood thinners used to prevent clotting. It's important to talk to your doctor about what type of treatment is right for you. Also, keep in mind that some individuals with MS develop complications from steroid therapy, so ask your doctor about whether you should stop taking the drug. If you take medicines for MS, you'll want to make sure you know the potential risks and benefits of each type of medicine, including possible interactions between different drugs and supplements.","Yes. If you have MS, it can affect your ability to work in many ways. There are several things that may affect the way you perform on a job and get along with coworkers or co-workers. These factors include:

How well you feel about yourself—the more severe the symptoms you experience, the worse your mood is likely to be and the fewer opportunities you will have for promotion.

Whether or not other people around you are aware of your condition—if you cannot go for a new assignment because you cannot face another person's negative reaction, or if your boss has no idea you suffer from MS, then your chances of getting promoted will be diminished.

Your ability to think clearly while working, which means your memory might be impaired. This affects how quickly you memorize information and how accurate you are at recalling it later.

The number of hours you spend out in public, as you must travel by car, bus, subway, airplane, train or taxi to do certain tasks like shopping for groceries, going to doctor appointments, etc., and so forth.

A general limitation in your ability to concentrate—you may become tired easily, lose track of time when doing large amounts of reading, or get bored easily, all leading to less effort, higher workloads and more errors.

Other medical conditions that can cause some degree of difficulty in work performance include migraines, arthritis, lupus, allergies, thyroid disease, depression and diabetes. Some patients with MS are also prone to stress and anxiety related to their disorder. It can take considerable self-confidence to maintain good relationships, or even maintain friendships with others who don't share the same condition. Many employers expect employees with MS to wear a hat, gloves, eyeglasses, earplugs, eye patch, bracelets and even helmets when they come into work, and this can put them at an immediate disadvantage. And, of course, there is always the possibility that some form of accident will occur while driving (for example, a head injury) and cause a loss of control during a turn that could result in bodily harm. In addition, the cost of insurance increases substantially for those who have a disability due to MS, so that it becomes increasingly difficult to afford health care expenses. Some insurers limit coverage of workplace accidents, regardless of whether someone was injured. Employers should make sure they cover workers' compensation benefits—including treatment—when needed.

Some employers may offer special accommodations to help employees deal with conditions such as MS","Multiple sclerosis is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions affecting people worldwide. It affects an estimated 1 in 200 Americans and over 3,000 people per year in Canada. The disease causes severe disability and loss of mobility, which may result in a reduced quality of life for affected individuals. In addition to debilitating physical symptoms (such as pain and numbness), MS patients are also at risk of significant emotional distress including depression, anxiety, social isolation, marital problems, family dysfunction, and mortality rates due to suicide or accidental death. Although there have been some encouraging developments with treatment advances for MS, there remain considerable barriers to effective treatment that limit their effectiveness. For example, about 50% of people diagnosed with MS still don't know they have the disorder. The lack of awareness has resulted in limited access to adequate care, delayed diagnosis, inadequate research, ineffective treatments, and other issues that make successful treatments difficult to deliver. It's not surprising that there remains skepticism regarding treatment options. Fortunately, researchers continue to discover new ways to treat MS and advance our understanding of the condition. This will help improve the lives of those living with MS by allowing them to live more independent and productive lifestyles while reducing the need for costly interventions that are associated with adverse side effects. There are several clinical trials underway to provide promising results on potential therapies that can reduce brain inflammation and protect neurons from damage caused by MS. If approved, these therapies could greatly impact the lives of millions of people across the globe.

About the Authors","Yes. Multiple sclerosis is a debilitating disease that causes progressive damage to the central nervous system, and it can cause permanent disabilities including blindness or paralysis. It affects people in all ages but more so those older than 50. The most common form of MS is called relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), which is characterized by attacks of relapses at irregular intervals. However, there are other forms such as secondary progressive MS (SPMS) where there may be no recurrence after an initial attack of symptoms.

People with RRMS also have a higher risk for stroke, heart failure and neurological complications like peripheral neuropathy. People who have SPMS often develop spinal cord compression when their legs become numb, painful or weak.

As well, they're more likely to experience cognitive problems such as memory loss, poor attention span, difficulty concentrating or problem solving. These effects usually begin within 2 years of diagnosis. In some cases, they last longer. Those with SPMS may need special equipment to walk or use a wheelchair; however, many still manage to work.

The good news is that once you've been diagnosed with MS, your life will be easier because it's less likely you'll suffer from any physical disability. You might even find ways to help yourself feel better without having to wait for a medical appointment — for example, by taking daily walks, getting plenty of exercise, staying physically active and not smoking!

If you know someone who has been diagnosed with MS, ask him/her about managing his/her condition. Also talk with friends and family members, too. Many people who have MS live in comfort, enjoying a full life without experiencing disabling physical symptoms. If you do find out that something is wrong with you or one of your loved ones, get immediate treatment.","Yes. MS can affect both the brain and the spinal cord, causing paralysis in an affected part of your body (the area of your body that is directly below your neck) while you are sleeping or walking around.

You may have some trouble with balance because your ability to move around may be affected, especially when you walk through doors. You may also experience difficulties concentrating on tasks at work or school or during play or other activities.

It's important for people who have MS to take medications as prescribed by their doctor to control symptoms. The medications used for this disease will usually include:

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs reduce inflammation in the muscles and joints of your nervous system and help relieve pain. They also help to prevent damage from the infection caused by MS. Your health care provider will tell you what type of medicine works best for you. Many medicines called ""spironolactone"" contain ingredients like aspirin that protect against harmful bacteria that cause most of the pain associated with MS. But these medicines do not cure the illness.

But these medicines do not cure the illness. Beta blockers. These medicines help ease tension in the nerves and relax muscles by changing how they respond to electrical signals coming into them. A beta blocker helps stop nerve cells from sending too many messages across the brain to other parts of your body, which causes muscle spasms.

Some people need additional vitamin B12 for proper functioning of nerves and blood vessels. A low level of this vitamin has been linked to increased risk of heart attack and stroke. The good news is that there is a safe way to get it. It","Yes, MS can impact your job prospects and productivity. The symptoms of the disease are subtle to those who do not have it but can be quite debilitating for those with the condition. However, people with MS can work in many different positions including physicians, nurses, architects and engineers. A number of jobs are particularly vulnerable to MS as they require a combination of physical strength, fine motor skills and mental agility that patients may experience with some frequency in their careers. For example, someone suffering from MS who is working as an electrician might find that he or she cannot perform such tasks as disconnecting electric power lines due to pain and discomfort. Additionally, the inability to drive could pose problems, if you own your own car but have trouble moving around on your feet while driving due to fatigue. It is important to remember that even though MS affects a person's ability to work, these conditions will not cause you to lose your job or make your salary drop significantly. Although employers may have difficulty finding qualified applicants with the required skill set for certain jobs, there are several ways to mitigate any potential negative effects. First, make sure that you get regular check-ups by your doctor and other health care providers for all areas of your body. Also, ensure that you are following up with your employer regularly so that you are properly informed about all procedures needed when you return to work. Some employers will pay extra attention to employees who have had MS symptoms as well as those who have had recent changes in their lives. Finally, while you should maintain good relationships with coworkers, avoid gossiping about anyone unless you know for sure that this is not going to be done out of malice or spite. If you suspect the rumor has been spread to hurt someone's feelings then politely bring it to their attention before making another big deal about it, and try to keep things quiet until it is no longer affecting others.

Q: How is MS diagnosed?\nAnswer: Typically, individuals who suffer from MS first notice the symptoms during middle age (50 years old), and they can develop the illness at any time between ages 15 and 60 (usually between 40 and 50). People who live into their 70s and 80s usually experience the onset of a more severe form of the disease which includes impaired coordination, muscle weakness and sometimes blindness or paralysis. Diagnosis of MS often depends on the history and physical exam findings given by a physician. While most doctors agree that it is difficult to diagnose MS in children because they are often misdiagnosed with a variety of medical conditions, they also point","Yes, MS can impact your ability to work. Because of the nature of the disease and its severity, it may also limit your employment opportunities. However, you should not lose confidence in your abilities because of this. For many people with MS, their symptoms are so debilitating that they cannot perform at any level. Even if your job requires very little activity on a daily basis (such as cleaning), it is important for you to maintain an active lifestyle through exercise, sports, or hobbies.

Q: Do I have to be married before having children?A: No, there is no minimum age requirement for marriage. Many couples who get pregnant by accident during their first pregnancy can be helped along by using fertility treatments. If you want to become pregnant yourself, consider finding out if your health insurance will cover prenatal care. It would be wise to consult with your doctor prior to deciding whether to try to conceive naturally, since some people find that natural methods of conception take much longer than trying to induce ovulation via artificial means (like fertility drugs).

Q: Can I use birth control pills when taking my medication?A: You need to make sure that the pill does not interfere with your treatment. If it does, talk to your doctor about changing the regimen to avoid pregnancy while taking your medications. A number of brands of oral contraceptive pills contain estrogen. Using these types of pills is often associated with more severe side effects such as breast tenderness, weight gain, mood swings, acne, irregular periods, and depression. Some women feel better after switching to less potent forms of estrogen. These less potent formulations include progestin-only pills like Ella, Cyproterone acetate, and Mirena®. In addition to making sure that your pill doesn't interfere with your medicine, do not forget to check with your doctor periodically to ensure that the pill is still being taken correctly and that you're maintaining a healthy body weight.

Q: Can I eat raw foods without getting sick?A: Raw food diets are considered dangerous by the FDA. Raw nuts, grains, fruits, vegetables, fish, meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products should only be eaten as part of a balanced diet. Food allergies, such as peanut and tree nut allergies, can cause serious reactions from eating certain foods. Your doctor should determine what is safe and appropriate for you to consume. Be aware that foods containing gluten, such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, spelt, and kamut are most likely to cause problems, especially"

What are the different types of MS?


There are four main types of MS -


Idiopathic MS is caused by genetic mutations or other environmental factors that are not known to have been associated with other diseases. These diseases can occur at any time during life and often lead to death before age 50. Idiopathic MS cannot be diagnosed because there are no clinical findings to rule out the cause.

These diseases can occur at any time during life and often lead to death before age 50. Idiopathic MS cannot be diagnosed because there are no clinical findings to rule out the cause. Primary Progressive MS is thought to result from both genetic and environmental factors. A person may develop primary progressive MS if they have had a stroke or another traumatic event that damages their blood vessels causing a blockage. The resulting inflammation may then trigger the development of multiple sclerosis. Other possible triggers include infection, drugs taken by mouth or inhaled, exposure to allergens, or other conditions such as autoimmune disease. If left untreated, patients may experience long term complications including diabetes mellitus and heart disease. Patients who have had strokes and/or other trauma may also develop secondary MS after treatment for primary progressive MS.

A person may develop primary progressive MS if they have had a stroke or another traumatic event that damages their blood vessels causing a blockage. The resulting inflammation may then trigger the development of","None, only one symptom can be listed in the questionnaire.

Q. What is the most common cause?\nAnswer: Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS), which occurs when abnormal immune cells attack and destroy myelin sheaths that surround nerves in your body. The disease progresses over time due to damage to the brain, spinal cord and other areas of the CNS. Symptoms may include loss of balance or coordination, numbness, weakness and difficulty with swallowing. In some cases, it may become difficult for patients to communicate, walk or even swallow. In severe cases, these problems may cause mental impairment, difficulty communicating and decreased ability to use muscles or movement skills. Common causes of MS are infection, trauma, genetic mutations, infections during pregnancy or labor, exposure to toxins such as lead from paint or environmental pollution, autoimmune conditions including thyroid disorders or rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, medications, stroke or seizures. It also happens more often in women than men.

What do people with MS need to know about their risk of developing ALS?

There is no evidence that any of the symptoms, diseases, disabilities, or illnesses described above are caused by MS alone. It is important to note that the term ""ALS"" includes all neurodegenerative, degenerative, and neurological diseases. The specific symptoms associated with each disease vary. Some have symptoms similar to those of MS; others are different. However, they should all be considered separately because they all share many features.","Multiple sclerosis symptoms include many things, including pain.

Q: What is the difference between MS and myasthenia gravis?

A: Myasthenia gravis is a neurological disorder with no known cure. The main symptom of MS is progressive weakness in one or both legs that can be painful and debilitating. People with MS sometimes experience fatigue as well, but it's not typically severe enough to interfere with daily life activities. Symptoms usually appear after age 20, but may occur any time during adulthood. People who have had multiple sclerosis for decades often continue to feel fatigued even though they've never been diagnosed with MS.","There are many different causes. Symptoms can include numbness, tingling or weakness in the hands and feet, muscle stiffness, a loss of balance, blurred vision, trouble speaking, problems with vision and even loss of speech.

Q: What is MS? A: Multiple sclerosis (MS) refers to progressive disease that affects the central nervous system in which damaged cells destroy nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. About 50 percent of people diagnosed with MS develop more than one type of the disorder and can suffer from paralysis in one or both legs. The remaining half are either completely unaffected or have only mild disability. Some types of MS result in no pain or sensory changes; others cause severe attacks that involve uncontrollable shaking or trembling. One type, called relapsing-remitting MS, usually starts in early adulthood but can be diagnosed as late as 40 years old. In some cases it develops slowly over time, affecting several areas of the body at once. There is currently no cure for MS. Treatment is designed to reduce symptoms and slow down progression. Most patients experience gradual improvement over time, although a small percentage will continue to experience significant impairments. The current treatment approach involves drugs such as steroids (such as prednisone), immunosuppressants (like interferon gamma or glatiramer acetate), and sometimes other medications. In addition, doctors may prescribe physical therapy and behavioral therapies (for example, mindfulness training). For those who cannot tolerate the side effects associated with these treatments, there are a variety of nonpharmacological options, including acupuncture and massage therapy.

Q: How does an MS patient use a computer keyboard?A: An MS patient typically uses their right hand to activate and navigate on a screen and left hand to adjust settings. Although it may take practice, they should learn how to move around comfortably while using a mouse. To help them keep track of what keys are being pressed, a person might use a laptop-style touchpad. It's important to remember that using a touchscreen device, like an iPad, requires you to hold your arm out straight in front of you rather than bend toward your chest as you would when typing. Another consideration is that computers do not recognize all fingers and can be difficult to write with. If you're having trouble reaching letters or numbers, try adjusting your grip to improve accuracy. If this doesn't work, consult a doctor about adjustments.","I have all the above (see above) symptoms.

Question: What was your first job?\nAnswer: I did some sales work in a department store for 4 years and then worked as a copywriter, but my interest turned to writing fiction and that's where I've been ever since.

Question: What do you consider the best part about being active on this site/community?\nAnswer: I love the discussions we can have here!

Question: Where are you from originally?\nAnswer: South Africa. It feels like home there because it is.

question: Name two authors who influenced you greatly and why?\nAnswer: Robert Jordan, Joss Whedon, Neil Gaiman and Frank Herbert. They all influence me more than any other author does.

Question: Favorite quote by an author or artist that has had an impact on your own life?\nAnswer: ""Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law."" - Albert Einstein

Question: Describe your worst experience with fans asking you personal questions during a book signing.\nAnswer: My worst experience was when people asked me if they could touch my face while I signed books. My son was there and I said, ""No thanks"" so he got out his phone and tried to take pictures of my nose. That pissed me off even more; this guy wasn't making the conversation better. So I just said, ""That's enough!""","(1) fatigue, (2) pain, (3) difficulty with daily activities

(4) weakness or numbness in some parts of body.

(5) unusual thoughts or feelings (not all patients have these).

Q53. Question: What is the treatment for multiple sclerosis?

A: Most doctors will start by starting a low dose steroid medicine called prednisone. Then they can gradually increase the dose as needed to help control the MS symptoms.

Q54. Question: How long does it take for my doctor to see me and how much does he/she pay attention to me while I'm being treated?

A: Your doctor has his/her own schedule. Many doctors do not work weekends because there are too many other patients on their busy schedules and that could make them late to your appointment. You can usually expect to be seen at least 2 times per week during the first 3 months after diagnosis.

The doctor may also ask you to fill out a health history form so they know more about you and if possible treat any conditions that might affect your care. In addition, the doctor should review your test results once a month to check for side effects and give you an update on treatment progress.

Some people find this information helpful when deciding whether to continue taking steroids.

Q55. Question: Can I return to school?

A: Yes, even though steroids have been used since the 1940s in treating multiple sclerosis. However, it's important to keep the medication in mind when you're thinking about returning to class. The steroids are often changed during the course of treatment, so it's important to get regular updates from your doctor.

After having had multiple sclerosis, you'll need more than just time off from physical activity and schooling. If your condition hasn't improved enough for you to resume full-time school, talk with your doctor about whether you would like to attend college or try an alternative method of education.

For More Information About Multiple Sclerosis","The following are possible multiple sclerosis symptom causes and symptoms:

• Musculoskeletal pain (pain in joints, tendons or muscles) • Joint swelling or stiffness • Joint tenderness/stiffness • Numbness/tingling in the hands/feet/arms • Confusion, problems with memory • Seizures/convulsions • Eye problems • Trouble swallowing • Difficulty breathing • Abdominal pain / cramps

CASE 4

In-Depth Question: What happened to you when you first learned that you had MS? Answer: I was a high school student. My teacher and mother both shared in my diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.

CASE 5

In-Depth Question: What did you know about MS at the time this test was administered? Answer: At the time, I didn't realize that I would be diagnosed with MS. However, one day on the way home from school, I realized how tired and slow I felt because of what seemed like all the pain. It turned out that I had gotten hit by a car while crossing the street and suffered some broken bones. I went back to school after a few days, but it took me another month before I got better enough for the rest of the semester. I wasn't able to play sports anymore either because I'd injure myself so badly during practice. But I still continued to work hard in my classes and enjoy being around people who knew about my condition.

CASE 6

In-Depth Question: If you could do anything again, would you change something about your life? Answer: Yes. I wish I had spent more time learning things about health care. Since I now have MS, I'm afraid I will never get to experience having someone look into my eyes and listen to my voice and tell me the next step for me. When I think back to why I wanted to become a nurse, it is because I believed I could help others and make a difference. If I ever find the confidence to ask those questions, I am sure they won't seem as important.

CASE 7

In-Depth Question: How did you learn your MS status? Answer: My mother told me she had MS when we were kids and that she couldn't walk without hurting herself. She also said her doctor thought it was an autoimmune disease. After trying many different therapies, including steroids and antihistamines, none helped her. Finally, her neurologist finally looked at her X-rays and told her he","Many! There are many different symptoms and signs. They can be quite subtle, or severe. It is best to consult your doctor for a diagnosis.

Q: What do I call the person who gets it? Answer: The MS patient.

Q: How long will it take me to recover from this illness if I am diagnosed with MS? Answer: It depends on how serious the disease is. Some people get better after just two weeks. Others need up to three months before they feel normal again. For more information about recovery please see our Recovery Center pages below.","Multiple sclerosis Symptoms

Answers should be read as follows: Breast Cancer (c): A cancer of the","Multiple sclerosis is a chronic disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects all parts of the body. The main symptom associated with MS are numbness, tingling and/or burning sensations on one or both sides of your face, hands, arms or legs.

The severity of MS is affected by the number of myelin sheath lesions in the brain. The more lesions there are, the worse the disease becomes. It can be quite common for people who have MS to notice their problems as being caused by something else - not a primary condition. This means that it's possible to experience some symptoms without knowing which specific MS-related disease is responsible for them. Some symptoms may also arise while you're taking medicines that affect the immune system, such as corticosteroids. Your GP will do tests to check if any of these conditions are causing you symptoms. If they are, you'll need to take extra steps so you don't feel unwell again when your medication is stopped. For instance, you could try taking vitamin supplements. You should also talk to your doctor about how to reduce the risk of getting side effects from prescribed medicine, including those connected with MS. Common MS symptoms include: dizziness, balance problems, poor memory, loss of balance or coordination, nausea, headaches, fatigue, muscle pain, weakness and joint pain.

What causes myeloid leukaemia? Myeloid leukaemia can cause symptoms such as fever, tiredness, weight loss, stomach aches and diarrhoea. These usually last at least a week but may persist for up to 3 months. A person with this type of cancer has an abnormal build up of white blood cells called T cells and B cells. These two types of cells help fight infections, such as flu. When T cells and B cells accumulate abnormally in the bone marrow, they can form tumours that spread throughout the body and damage normal organs, such as the liver, kidneys and thymus gland. As well as leukaemias, other types of cancer that involve the bone marrow include lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALS). People with both forms of these cancers can develop symptoms similar to those seen with MS. See separate leaflet called 'Your health and your treatment' for details of treatment options available."
72,Question: Is the Covid-19 vaccine safe for people taking multiple sclerosis drugs?\nAnswer:,"The CVS Cervarix (Covid) 19 vaccine is considered safe for patients taking corticosteroids. For those who are not taking steroids, other precautions should be taken to reduce your risk of getting an infection with this vaccine.

How Do I Remove All Three Vaccines From My Body?

Vaccine Administration Instructions

The CVS Cervarix (Covid) 19 vaccine must be administered by a healthcare provider. Your health care provider will insert the needle into each vial and hold it in place until all three vaccines have been given (see below). Before you begin the process, you may want to take a few minutes to review these instructions:

Read through the following instruction sheet that comes with the CVS Cervarix (Covid) 19 vaccine before giving it to yourself or someone else. You can find the CVS Cervarix (Covid) 19 vaccine instruction sheet in the section entitled ""What's In This Booklet"" near the end of this information leaflet. The booklets contain important information about how the vaccine works as well as any side effects you might experience during vaccination. A copy of this booklet is available at your local pharmacy. It also appears on our website at www.cdc.gov/vaccines or by calling 1-800-232-4636.


A patient's healthcare provider will examine you in person if necessary when you receive the vaccine; if there is concern for potential serious adverse reactions from the vaccine, ask your healthcare provider about alternative options.

If you receive more than one dose of the vaccine at one time, give one dose orally and then wait 3 days between doses. If you choose to skip the oral portion of the vaccine, do not give another dose within 14 days after receiving the first dose, but instead, wait 7 days after the second dose. After 7 days, give another single dose of the vaccine (this does not count against your 28 day total) unless your healthcare provider advises you otherwise. If you miss two doses and wish to get three doses of the vaccine, ask your healthcare provider to call 1-855-237-2899 so that they can administer the third dose.

After administering the vaccines, remove the syringe(s), clean your hands thoroughly with soap and water and place them on your skin and cover your mouth with either an envelope or plastic bag. Then put both arms down in front of you and spread your legs wide apart. You must","Yes.

Q: What is the best way to get the vaccine if you are under 5 years old and have not had it before?\nAnswer: There is no ""best"" age, just like with any other vaccination. You should be given the first dose as soon as possible after your child's birthday (usually February). The recommended schedule is shown on our Vaccine Schedule page or by contacting us at 1-(800) 871-4357. If there is a delay in getting the vaccine, call 2-1-1 and let someone know what the problem is so that they can send out the correct vaccine(s).

Q: Are vaccines made with aborted human fetuses safe?\nAnswer: The vaccine maker does not make their products using fetal cells. However, if a person who has received the vaccine becomes ill within 3 months of receiving this vaccine, the vaccine may not work properly. In such cases, the patient should receive another shot of the same type and number of doses of the vaccine. A new injection should be used. This also applies to adults under 18 years old. To prevent complications from this vaccine, parents and caregivers must follow all directions on the package insert for the vaccine and must notify the manufacturer if they suspect an adverse reaction. It is important that everyone who receives the vaccine takes care to keep the area where he/she will store the vaccine clean and dry between administrations.

Back to Top","The short answer is no.

The long answer is this:

It's not known whether this particular product is harmful or does more harm than good; it can't be known because its safety has never been studied and there have not been any clinical trials conducted to determine if the vaccination will help reduce disability in MS patients, as promised by the manufacturer of Covid-19. But what we do know is that even a small risk may be too great to take any chances with another person's health when it comes to vaccines.

Vaccination rates are dropping for a number of reasons, including parents' concerns about autism, fear of side effects from certain kinds of diseases, increased concern over side effects from vaccines, and even some religious objections. In other words, many children don't want to get the shots they're supposed to get. That means fewer kids are getting them, which means there'll be less protection against disease. This makes sense, but not much sense if you believe that vaccines are safe. After all, anyone who has taken any kind of medical treatment knows that it's best to err on the side of caution and avoid doing anything that might cause injury or illness. By contrast, those who subscribe to the anti-vaccine movement think that vaccines aren't necessary—and that doctors are simply afraid to administer them in order to push their own personal agendas, such as promoting childhood immunization programs (which they consider dangerous) or even the belief that vaccines caused the 9/11 attacks (which they regard as unproven).

In fact, since 2004, there has not been one case of a vaccine causing death among 10 million people worldwide vaccinated with DTaP, DTP, Hib, IPV, MMR, varicella, meningococcal conjugate vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine, tetanus toxoid, PCV7, or polio. There were three cases reported after each of these events, so those are the ones most commonly mentioned as causes of death in those reporting deaths following the vaccination, though it's likely that others contributed in small numbers.

So yes, as stated above, the antivaccine movement has pushed vaccines off the public agenda. Unfortunately, it appears to have succeeded.

One reason why there haven't been more deaths linked to vaccinations is that those who had died did not get vaccinated while alive and thus didn't receive that protection. Another reason is that it's very difficult to ascertain if someone was actually harmed by a vaccine. For example, the CDC","Yes, this vaccine is safe if taken as directed.

Dosage & Administration

What dosage do I need to take? How much should I give my child during each visit? The recommended dose of this vaccine depends on your child's age. This vaccine is usually given by mouth (oral) once a week. But there are exceptions, which you must find out about with your doctor before giving your child any dose of this vaccine. You can also talk to your doctor or nurse to learn more. What kinds of medications and supplements will I need to take when I receive this vaccine? There is no specific list of what medicines or supplements are needed because most people feel well enough without them. However, some children who have had an allergic reaction to measles-containing vaccines may be advised to avoid certain foods that contain egg proteins. Does my baby need to get vaccinated against mumps, rubella, varicella, polio, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, influenza A, influenza B, pertussis, meningitis, chickenpox, pneumococcal disease, rotavirus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, varicella, Haemophilus influenzae type c, influenza virus infection, tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough, rabies, human papillomavirus, herpes simplex virus type 2 and 3, shingles, measles-mumps-rubella syndrome, rotavirus gastroenteritis and pneumococcal pneumonia, pneumococcal diseases? As long as they're at least 6 months old, babies who've never been vaccinated against these infections aren't required to get one of these vaccinations until they turn 9 months old. If your baby has had two doses of MMR vaccine by 12 months of age, then she'll be covered by her current vaccination schedule. And if she was born after 1957 and received all three doses of the MMR vaccine in the first year of life, she'll be covered by her current vaccination schedule. How many doses does the vaccine come with? Your child can receive up to four doses of the vaccine. It doesn't matter how many times a child gets it; whether she takes five or 10 doses, all of her shots count toward her annual childhood immunization requirement. How soon will I see results from getting this vaccine? Some children can start seeing their immune systems improve within two weeks after receiving the vaccine. Others might take up to eight weeks. The exact time frame depends on the child's","Yes, if taken with other medications.

Q&A: What is the difference between the vaccine and the drug that's being given? A vaccine is a medicine made from living organisms. The ingredients in a vaccine are not harmful to you or your child. It can be dangerous when used incorrectly. For example, some medicines may weaken the immune system of children who've been vaccinated. Some vaccines contain live viruses. If this happens, it could lead to serious illness, even death. It also is possible that some infections caused by the virus in the vaccine may cause problems in someone who has no immunity to them. In most cases, however, these reactions have happened only after the person had already developed an infection.

Why should I get the flu shot?

The vaccine protects against two types of influenza virus. The ""live"" kind makes you sick (fever) if you come into contact with it. The ""inactivated"" version causes fewer symptoms but lasts longer in your body. You may feel better right away, but then your fever will return. This is normal. However, if you think you're getting sick from the vaccine (or any medication), call your doctor right away.

Who shouldn't get the flu vaccine?

Influenza infection is extremely rare. There were about 3 million cases of seasonal influenza reported during 2012. Of those, an estimated 48,000 people died. These figures do not include deaths that occurred before the season began, so there is little evidence that getting the flu shot would make you more likely to die of pneumonia, pneumonia-like illness (PELI), influenza-related complications, nor flu-associated hospitalization or death. Getting vaccinated does not protect against these diseases.

What is the recommended age to receive the flu vaccine?

You need to be at least 6 months old to get the flu vaccine. Children younger than 5 years of age should receive one dose of the flu vaccine as part of their routine vaccination schedule. All children aged 11 through 65 years who are hospitalized or receiving medical care for influenza should receive a second dose of the vaccine within 10 days of discharge or hospitalization. Flu shots are usually administered at least 72 hours after exposure to influenza.

How long does the flu vaccine stay in my body?

Vaccines typically last up to 8 weeks; the peak time for protection is 2–4 weeks later. People should check their immunizations each year to see how they're doing.

Will the flu vaccine prevent me","Yes, it is. The Covid-19 vaccine has been in use since the late 1980s and is recommended by the CDC as a first line of defense against MS when other treatments have failed.

When people who take multiple sclerosis medications are exposed to the virus that causes MS (Covid) or live viruses such as Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), they can get sick. These include:

• Patients on chemotherapy or radiation therapy for MS

• People with autoimmune diseases

• HIV/AIDS patients

These illnesses all cause inflammation in the body; however, the condition caused by the virus is much more serious because it causes damage inside the brain.

People who receive multiple sclerosis medicine can still be infected with this virus if they don't know it's there and their immune system isn't strong enough to fight off the infection. But once you're exposed, you usually won't become ill from this virus.

The good news about MS, though, is that your own immune system will eventually fight off this infection. When it does, you'll stop experiencing symptoms of MS.","Yes. In fact, these medications are already known to weaken the immune system of MS patients and the current vaccines will help improve their response rate. The vaccines work by boosting the body's ability to respond to ""natural"" killer cells (NK), which have been shown to stimulate production of antibodies that neutralize a wide range of pathogens, including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This can also reduce viral load in the blood, thus increasing overall immunity to infection.

How Much Does It Cost?

The price is $100 per dose ($5-10) in both quantities, plus $40 for shipping (depending on where you live). The CDC recommends getting one booster shot every five years or whenever there has been a change in a person's life circumstances. However, if your doctor gives you an HIV test before giving you this first booster, you may be able to get the MMR vaccination free (with no additional cost, because it is covered by Medicaid).","Yes. The recommended minimum dose is 20 mcg of diphtheria toxoid per kg of body weight (which is about 1/100th of the dosage for adults), but a person's immune system will make up its own tolerance to this vaccine and can tolerate higher doses than indicated. The current average adult dose is 40 mcg, with a range from 2 to 200 mcg; the most common side effects are mild flu-like symptoms, which include fatigue, headache, muscle aches, joint stiffness, and nausea. It should be noted that people who take multiple sclerosis medications have been shown to respond better to two types of vaccines than they do to one type; therefore, it would not be appropriate to use a single vaccine during treatment. In addition, these medicines also prevent the spread of disease, so the risk of getting measles or mumps from receiving more than the usual doses of MMR is extremely low.

Q4: Do I need to wear protection when using cellphones in public places?A: No. The best way to protect yourself against catching any infection while you're sitting on your phone is by paying attention to what you're doing while you're using a mobile device. Many infections don't require antibiotics at all. However, if you think an infection might happen, stop what you're doing immediately, wash hands thoroughly, get an antibiotic prescription right away, and then go to a clinic or doctor's office to get tested. If you have questions about whether a certain product may cause an infection, talk to your healthcare provider.

The Bottom Line

There's no question that there are many risks associated with the HPV vaccines. But despite their potential dangers, the benefits of these vaccines far outweigh the potential risks. They'll be used as part of routine vaccination programs throughout the United States, Canada, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong, India, Vietnam and the Philippines beginning next year.","Yes, the Covid-19 vaccine is as safe as any other type of flu shot.

Why You Should Have The Vaccine

How It Works

The Covid-19 vaccine is a live virus (virus that can replicate in your body) that has been weakened or killed by heat and pressure in order to produce an injectionable form of the disease-causing agent. As with all vaccines, you get the ""live"" product inactivated in your body before it's made into its injected, cure-all form.

Who Gets The Vaccine Injections?

Children younger than 6 months old who have had two doses of the same influenza strain and are at risk from influenza are eligible for this vaccine. This includes those who:

Are hospitalized or may become hospitalized due to respiratory illnesses caused by the A(H3N2) virus.


Have close contact with patients who were infected with the H1N1 virus or the C959 virus. If you have close contact with someone who was sickened by either virus, talk to them about getting vaccinated. For more information on influenza viruses and their symptoms, please visit Fluoridealert.org

If you are traveling abroad and you will be staying with an individual who recently traveled outside of the United States, ask them if they would like to receive the vaccine or if they need additional time to recover before they travel. There may also be questions regarding vaccination during pregnancy. Contact CDC for more details.

What Are The Side Effects Of The Vaccination?

All children who received the vaccine developed mild upper respiratory tract illness (nasal congestion), fever (temperature less than 100.4 F or 38.8°C), headache, muscle aches, and rash. Some children reported neck stiffness. Children under 2 years old who got the vaccine had no significant side effects.

Most people don't experience serious side effects. Most common side effects include soreness or redness at the site where the injection was given. Other side effects include low energy or sleepy feeling. Serious allergic reactions (including eye swelling, itching, skin rash, hives, difficulty breathing, trouble swallowing, coughing up blood, or wheezing) have been reported rarely. However, these can happen even after receiving the recommended number of shots within 24 hours.

Is Anyone Getting Sick From The Vaccine?

No. Although some reported cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (an autoimmune disorder that causes","No. The use of a corticosteroid medication is a contraindication to receiving any of these vaccines. People who are taking this medication should not receive any of the above vaccines.

The following information and recommendations should be kept in mind when considering vaccination. It may help to compare your symptoms with those of other persons being vaccinated. Your doctor can discuss specific concerns and provide you with further guidance on treatment if necessary."
77,Question: How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?\nAnswer:,"Multiple sclerosis symptoms that may occur during the late stage of menopause include dizziness, fatigue and pain. However, women who are in early or late stages of their menstrual cycle have no symptoms during this time.

What is the difference between a female and male hormonal imbalance? A woman's menstrual cycles usually follow a pattern of about 14 days of menses followed by 3-5 days of bleeding. In addition, there may be one period of heavy periods followed by several light periods. Menstrual cycle length varies widely among different races, but it averages about 28 days with an average of 26 days of menstruation per year.


How can I detect early onset of menopause? Menopausal symptoms may not appear until one has reached middle age. Symptoms typically start on the day after the end of the last menstrual period (menarche) or shortly thereafter for women whose cycles are regular. Some women may experience symptoms as early as their 40s or 50s, however, most symptoms will become evident within 5 years. At least 80% of patients diagnosed with early onset menopause report having experienced these symptoms before they turned 40. The following signs may indicate early menopause:

Painful breasts

Feeling of heaviness in breast tissue

Weight gain or loss

Irritability

Change in sexual desire or function

Menopausal changes often begin around ages 55 and continue for another 10 years or more. Asymptomatic menopause occurs when the uterus stops producing hormones, which causes the body to enter what is known as a post-menopausal state. Women who are diagnosed with menopausal symptoms should consult a doctor immediately if they notice any of the symptoms listed above.

If you suspect your symptoms might be related to something other than your reproductive system, see your family physician, gynecologist, dermatologist or other health care professional.","The most significant changes in the course of MS that occur after menses are those associated with changes in the immune system.\u003c\/p>

It's caused by an autoimmune reaction against myelin, which covers nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The immune system destroys myelin, triggering severe attacks on the central nervous system (CNS).

The most common symptom of MS is weakness or numbness in your hands, feet, face or neck. Another manifestation of MS is pain called neuropathy, meaning damage to nerves throughout your body. This can cause problems with vision, balance, nausea and vomiting, weakness, fatigue and muscle cramps. Other symptoms include depression, memory loss, impaired speech, coordination issues, trouble walking and balance. In some cases, MS can lead to dementia, but this condition usually develops after many years of living with the disease. Some people experience complications such as stroke or heart attack during MS.","Menopause causes a shift in the balance of estrogen, which helps maintain regular menstrual cycles. This imbalance leads to a drop in progesterone (a hormone that regulates the body's natural production of estrogen and progesterone), which is then released into the blood during menstruation as a result of the fall in estrogen levels. This excess estrogen promotes inflammation of skin cells due to the increase in free radicals created by it.

Menstrual dysfunction can also contribute to inflammatory lesions such as nodules (fluid-filled cysts) on skin, eyes or joints. When these fluid filled cysts rupture, they become inflamed and painful, which may lead to eye or joint infections. The inflammation can cause scarring resulting in reduced mobility of affected joints.

Symptoms typically occur between age 50 and 75 years. Some women are able to get through all stages of menopause without any problems while others experience more severe symptoms.

Some women report pain and/or swelling around their pelvic area at night when they have no periods while others describe this sensation as continuous and intense. Symptoms can include hot flashes, mood swings, irritability, loss of libido, weight gain, low energy, anxiety and depression, fatigue, shortness of breath and other chronic conditions that mimic symptoms of MS. It is estimated that 5% of women over the age of 45 will develop some form of MS. Women who suffer from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who have had a hysterectomy may be at an increased risk for developing ovarian cancer. Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome can interfere with the menstrual cycle, leading to irregular or missing monthly periods. Women experiencing menopause symptoms should consult their physician about possible medical issues related to the hormonal changes experienced during menopause.","Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes the body's immune system to attack its own tissues, resulting in various neurological and physical problems. Menopause can be an important part of MS treatment as it decreases the amount of estrogen (the female hormone) produced by the ovaries, thus slowing down the progression of MS.

Q: Why are some women more prone to have polycystic ovarian syndrome than others? A: In general, if you suffer from excessive menstrual cycles, weight gain, acne, irregular periods or trouble conceiving, then chances are high that you may also have Poly Cystitis, the most common cyst-related disorder. While the exact cause for this condition isn't known, a number of factors can play into why some women develop polycystic ovarian syndrome while others don't. For example, it has been shown that women with higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol are more likely to develop the disease.[1] Additionally, certain genetic variations in the genes involved in metabolism can also increase your risk.


Q: What does fibroids mean to my uterus/uterus? A: Fibroids are abnormal growths on the walls of the uterus, which means they're not cancerous, but they may need to be treated. This is because fibroids represent waste buildups and are typically present at birth. These build up tissue that obstructs normal flow of urine, causing discomfort and pain during urination. Because they're often invisible, it's sometimes difficult to spot fibroids; however, you should see them when examining your pelvic region. When a fibroid grows rapidly, it may feel like a lump and may look similar to small bumps on the skin. If the growth becomes larger over time or when pressure is applied, it will become obvious. There are two types of fibroids. The benign ones are less severe, usually no bigger than 2 centimeters across. They'll disappear within 12 months after being removed. The malignant ones are about 3 centimeters in diameter and are usually very painful. Although they do shrink naturally over time, there are several options available for removal. One option involves using heat to soften and release them and another involves surgery. Surgery for benign fibroids is considered risky and requires extensive follow-up. Some doctors recommend having the growth surgically removed by a board certified surgeon who specializes in hysterectomies. If the fibroid grows so much that it blocks the flow of blood to other organs, the best treatment is to get a","The two disorders are not related. In fact, the majority of women who develop MS are diagnosed with a history of PMS or premenstrual syndrome (PMS). This is because both conditions tend to resolve on their own within 3-5 years after they begin.

The link between premenstrual syndrome and PMS has been known for some time; however, it was recently demonstrated that this association may be causal in patients with either condition. The mechanism behind this connection is unknown but could involve changes in levels of hormones affecting the brain during pregnancy. A similar hypothesis also exists regarding the relationship between PMS and Alzheimer's disease (AD), where there is now evidence that women who have premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are more likely than normal women to have AD later in life. It should be noted, however, that although these studies show an association between premenstrual dysphoric disorder and AD, it does not prove causation.

In contrast to the studies showing causation, other studies show no relationship between the two conditions. For example, one large study found that nearly all premenopausal women had low estrogen levels at baseline. By the end of the six month period of testing, only 35% of participants reported any type of change in hormone levels. Thus, the research shows that premenstrual dysphoric disorder does not directly cause PMS; rather, high estrogen levels appear to increase depression and irritability in those affected by PMS.[3]

Another possibility for why symptoms do not correlate closely with each other is due to differences in age at onset of symptoms. Women who experience PMS before menarche start experiencing the first signs of the menstrual cycle. Therefore, the presence of symptoms earlier in the menstrual cycle can confuse the issue as to whether the symptoms are due to premenstrual syndrome. However, when symptoms arise later in the menstrual cycle, it can make them much easier to distinguish from symptoms associated with PMS. One study investigated over 100 women with PMS and found that the majority experienced symptoms prior to menarche. When asked to distinguish between premenstrual symptoms and PMS, most did so correctly.[4]

For example, women who are past menopause have a higher risk for developing MS; in fact, about 5% of MS patients are women and almost 40% are over 50 years old.

What Are The Symptoms Of Menopause?\n

Menopausal symptoms include hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, loss of libido, insomnia, mood changes (e.g., depression, irritability), weight gain, acne, breast tenderness, vaginal odor, vaginal irritation and discomfort and vaginal discharge.","Menopause is the end of menstruation in women, and it's associated with a number of symptoms. This includes tiredness, weight loss (weight gain), fatigue, and mood changes. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease where a person has inflammation of the brain and spinal cord caused by myelin-related proteins called oligodendrocytes that form an insulation around nerve fibers. These proteins are also known as demyelinating oligodendrocyte glycoproteins, or DOGs.

Symptoms from MS can include numbness, tingling, weakness, difficulty swallowing, problems with vision, hearing, balance, coordination, and trouble walking. The disease affects about one out of every 100 people worldwide. It often begins between ages 20 and 50 years old.

In addition to the common symptoms of MS, some people develop symptoms such as numbness on the side of the face, arm, leg, foot or other body part. Symptoms may occur suddenly but usually resolve within 3 months after the onset of menopause.

It's not clear why menopause occurs at different times for each woman but scientists believe that there may be an immune system effect that causes more MS infections during this time. In other words, when women get their periods, they don't have antibodies attacking themselves. During these times, menopausal hormones promote the growth of certain T cells that could lead to more infections. However, this link hasn't been proven yet.

Why might this happen? It's unclear why menopause occurs differently in different populations. For example, it's thought that differences in lifestyle, diet, stress levels, exposure to radiation, and genetic factors contribute to menopause timing. Other possible reasons that make people more susceptible to getting MS later in life, include genetics, age, medications, smoking, alcohol consumption, pregnancy, and hormonal fluctuations that affect how much estrogen you produce in your body.","There is a relationship between the two, but only if you are taking anti-rejection drugs.

Q: Can I get MS from having sex with someone who has MS? \nAnswer: No. Multiple sclerosis is caused by an immune response that targets and destroys myelin, a protective sheath around nerve cells in the brain, spinal cord and limbs (myelination). In other words, it's not the body attacking your nervous system. Having sexual intercourse doesn't affect any of these processes at all.

Q: Is there a connection between MS and high blood pressure? \nAnswer: Yes. When myelin damage occurs, the immune system attacks the fluid surrounding myelin. This results in abnormal pressure within the bloodstream, which can lead to hypertension (high blood pressure), stroke or heart attack. And just like with MS, this kind of inflammation will occur even when no one is trying to hurt anyone else!

Q: What causes MS? \nAnswer: At birth, there are three types of cells found throughout our bodies. These cell types have their own genes. Over time, as we age, the number of these cell types decreases (a process called ""neurodegeneration""). The cause of most chronic diseases such as MS is unknown, but scientists believe it may be because some of our inherited gene variants alter the body's immune response to certain substances. For example, one genetic variant may make your immune system less sensitive to bacteria or viruses. By being exposed to more pathogens over longer periods of time, the body becomes unable to clear out the invaders and begins to accumulate them. A second genetic variation may contribute to the formation of scar tissue. With age, this scar tissue begins to harden and blocks nerves in the peripheral nervous system (the part of the brain and spinal cord that controls movement, sensation and emotions). In addition to causing pain, numbness, tingling sensations, fatigue and mental confusion, MS also affects vision, hearing, coordination, balance, speech and swallowing. Most people with MS experience problems with walking, climbing stairs or getting into cars. About 5% of MS patients suffer permanent disability after diagnosis.

Q: Why does MS progress so quickly?\nAnswer: Because MS is often misdiagnosed, the disease progresses slowly, which makes diagnosis more difficult. Even though the disease progresses rapidly, early diagnosis and treatment may improve overall mobility. If left untreated, however, the condition can worsen until full recovery takes place. The good news is that MS can be"
79,Question: Can I pass multiple sclerosis to other family members?\nAnswer:,"If you have MS and a close relative with the same condition, it is possible to pass the condition on to them. However, if they already know that you have MS and are receiving treatment for it, there will not be an increased risk of your child being affected by MS.\NIn fact, if any one parent or sibling has MS, passing the disease to another will increase the chances that both children will develop MS in their lifetime, which would be dangerous for all concerned.

Q: How do I tell my baby if I plan to have MS later in life?

A: It can take time for your body to develop symptoms of MS. Therefore, it may take many years before you notice signs of MS. Once you realize that you have MS, you can begin identifying its early warning signals and taking steps to protect yourself from becoming disabled. This will help ensure that you don't get caught off guard. For example, you should try to avoid going out during times when your doctor expects severe symptoms. You can also wear light-colored clothing at night (like jeans and tights) and stay home as much as possible between 9 PM and 6 AM because these conditions cause inflammation in the brain. You should also try to avoid eating too much sugar or food high in carbohydrates since this can aggravate symptoms of MS such as numbness or weakness in parts of your body. These things combined with good sleep habits and exercise can help keep your body healthy so that it does not have to fight against MS.

Q: Are there medications that can prevent, stop, or slow progression of MS?

A: The most commonly used drugs for treating MS are interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, glatiramer acetate (Glatiramer), adalimumab, and etanercept (Remicade). Other drugs include mesial temporal lobe degeneration (MTLD) inhibitors like riluzole, tacrolimus, infliximab, temozolomide, verapamil, lopinavir/ritonavir, cobicistat, natalizumab, and teriflunomide. There is no evidence that any drug alone is effective in controlling or preventing progression of MS. Rather, each treatment strategy reduces the likelihood of MS worsening over time.

It's important to note that even though some medications can halt progression, they cannot cure","Yes. In fact, most of the time it is possible to pass multiple sclerosis to someone else who has a different genetic cause from you, because they are genetically more similar than you and their immune system may have been weakened by disease. However, in some cases this can be difficult or impossible.

If you are concerned that your child will not develop multiple sclerosis on his own, please talk with an MS patient's care team about all options available for treatment, including drug therapy. For information on the best way to help your child stay well during treatment, call 1-800-MSEARCH (1-800-674-6864) for answers to questions about MS medication and diagnosis and treatment options.","Yes. Although it is not a cure, the MS treatment can give you some of the benefits and control many symptoms that accompany the disease (such as fatigue and numbness in your fingers). You may also be able to get certain drugs called second generation immunosuppressants, which are approved for use by most insurance companies. If you are taking second generation immunosuppressants at the same time as you have MS, or if your doctor tells you to take them while treating MS, they will only work when taken together. The medications used to treat MS do not prevent the development of all forms of cancer in humans, so you should talk with your healthcare professional about any health problems related to having MS.

Q: How much money am I entitled to receive from my insurance company after I start treatment? \nA: This depends on where you live and what type of coverage you have. Generally speaking, if you have coverage through your employer (but not if you're self-employed) you will need to pay out-of-pocket costs of $1,000/month before you begin receiving any benefit payments. For example, if you make $25,000 per year, then you would spend 50% of your salary on treatment every month. Some people with high incomes choose to ""co-pay"" their insurance premiums because of how much extra money they save each month compared to paying full price. However, this amount isn't always consistent across states, so check your state's website for more information. You can find details on what your insurer covers at www.medicaid.gov.

Q: What kind of tests are done to diagnose MS?\nA: A number of laboratory tests are required to rule out other conditions that may cause symptoms similar to those seen with MS. These include: blood tests to screen for infections; liver function test to look for fatty deposits; and urinalysis to look for excess fluid retention. Once these tests show no abnormalities, you'll receive a diagnosis of MS. But there are also many other lab tests that can help determine if someone has MS and can tell us if you already have it. Your physician might order one of the following tests: An electrocardiogram to monitor heart function; an MRI to examine the brain; a bone marrow biopsy to see if you have inherited any mutations that may increase the risk of developing MS; a colonoscopy to check for diseases causing ulcers in the digestive tract; and a CT scan to look for tumors in the","Yes. If you have both MS and another condition, the genetic test can help determine whether your symptoms are caused by one disease or by more than one. You must meet all of the following conditions for this to be possible:

Your mother, father, sister, brother, niece, nephew, aunt, or first cousin (within 3 generations) has any of these diseases. For example, you would not be able to pass either type of MS to a child if your parent had both MS and sickle cell anemia.


If you do NOT meet all of the above requirements, there is no way to know which inherited condition(s) may cause which symptoms in you.

For more information about the test and how it works, call 1-877-4MDS-0011.","Yes, MS can be passed from parent to child.\r

MS causes a breakdown of the immune system in the brain and spinal cord, which may affect how it affects the body's ability to fight infections. This means that even if you do not have MS yourself, you may have an increased chance of developing MS later on or having a severe form of the disease. In fact, there are genetic mutations known as ""seropositivity"" that increase your risk for developing MS. A person who has one such mutation is considered seronegative, meaning their immune systems are unable to produce antibodies against their own tissues. They will still need protection from viruses and bacteria in order to prevent infection, but they cannot effectively fight off MS. There is also evidence that suggests that children with one of these genes have higher rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) later in life, though this remains controversial.[1]\r

The following guidelines should help families understand why they shouldn't assume someone else has MS unless they're very sure:

Don't rely only on symptoms. If someone tells you they've experienced some sort of symptom (such as numbness, tingling, weakness), don't automatically assume they must be having MS. Other conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure, often cause similar symptoms. Also, don't assume someone has been diagnosed with MS just because of what's listed on the medical record. Most physicians aren't aware that MS even exists. When people tell me about how they're feeling, they're usually describing something completely different than MS. For example, someone might say they feel tired but still want to go out, while others might simply think they're ""sick."" Don't let assumptions lead you astray either; many illnesses make the same symptoms look very different.[2] \r

Watch for signs of MS. Symptoms include fatigue, depression, difficulty concentrating, and blurred vision. Even if you believe MS isn't affecting them, be cautious about drawing conclusions about the condition based solely on those symptoms. Some people have no symptoms at all. Others are able to work full time despite having problems sleeping or focusing. And then there are people whose illness impacts every aspect of their lives. Take note of changes in behavior that could indicate MS, such as unexplained absences, loss of appetite, or poor concentration.[3] \r

Be open to a possible diagnosis. Many times, when a family member comes into the office complaining of unexplained fatigue and mood swings, it could mean","Yes, it is possible. MS does not affect blood flow or oxygen delivery in the lungs and may therefore pass through several families without having any effect on your own health. However, a few things should be noted about this option if you have one parent with MS and another who is unaffected by the disease: \1. You can only pass MS to your offspring if both parents are affected by the disease. Some genetic diseases such as Tay Sachs and Williams Syndrome can cause an extra copy of a gene that causes MS. This extra copy does not always result in MS but may lead to problems with some of the symptoms associated with the disease (such as vision, speech or balance problems).\2. If one parent has MS, there will probably be no risk for you if you inherit the same mutations from both of them. In most cases, however, people with a history of a certain form of the disease cannot pass a mutation to their children. In rare instances, people with these forms of MS can transmit a mutation from one parent to their children via either sperm or egg donation. It's also important to note that other genes besides those known to cause MS can influence whether someone inherits MS or passes it down to their children. For example, if you have inherited a deletion of a certain DNA segment from your mother (called X-linked recessive) then chances are you will not develop MS yourself. The reason is that even though your mother inherited a different type of CSR, she doesn't carry a copy of the complete region on her chromosome containing the relevant portion of the mutation. By contrast, if you inherit a specific segment of DNA called the CCR5-related protein 30 from your father, chances are you would develop MS because your mother does contain a full copy of that entire segment.

How long does it take for MS to progress to signs and symptoms? Answer: There isn't much agreement among scientists when describing how fast MS progresses. Some research studies suggest that MS often becomes apparent within five years of onset. Others believe that diagnosis of MS should occur at least two years before any symptoms appear, although others report that they see many patients with more advanced disease than this. Scientists use a number of different methods to assess how well an individual's brain functions and responds to external stimuli. These include neuropsychological testing (which measures skills like memory, attention span and reasoning ability), MRI scans (which measure the volume and density of nerve cells in the brain), MRIs (which are used to determine the strength and location of connections between","Yes, you can pass multiple sclerosis to your spouse. If the disease is diagnosed in a child, parents or siblings, it will be passed on through at least one generation. The chance of passing it to others depends largely on how many generations are involved. However, there's no need to panic if this happens and your relatives don't seem worried about it. They might not realize that they're carrying it until they have symptoms themselves or when they see what doctors call ""an increased risk factor.""

Q. Re: Do I get any more money from my ex-husband after he remarries?: You'll get less for divorce than you would have received before you got divorced. So, yes, you should file for divorce.

A: I do agree with you on the fact that the amount of time to file for divorce is longer than in the past because of the Internet. As I said earlier, there are still cases out there where people wait years before filing. But now, when everyone has access to legal information via the Internet, I think it will become easier to file. This new technology also makes it much cheaper for women (and men) to sue their husbands who cheat them out of wages.

I know a few married couples that have had their marital problems solved by a court order ordering each spouse to take an anti-depressant medication (for example, Zoloft). It seems like most judges feel that unless you have a very good reason why you want a prescription, then you don't deserve one. I remember once hearing the judge say to a woman, ""You must really hate me. Why did you send me that letter?"" She replied, ""Well, I didn't, but I'm so tired of him doing these terrible things to me!"" A lot of divorces begin as a couple fighting over property, alimony and division of assets. Now, both parties have the ability to file for divorce.

And I'd add one more thing: Many courts allow parties to present witnesses in support of their case and to question anyone else supporting the opposing side—even co-workers, family and friends. There's never been anything like it before, but some people find it helpful in settling disputes.","Yes. A parent with MS can transmit the disease (MS) to his or her children and grandchildren by transmitting the MS antibodies that cause the illness, called ""autoantibodies"".

Q: How does this work?\nAnswer: Autoimmune diseases are caused when a person's body is invaded by an abnormal form of bacteria known as an infectious microbe called a pathogen. The immune system then attacks the harmful bacteria, but instead of killing it completely, it creates a reaction by creating antibodies that attack healthy cells in your body. These antibodies can attach themselves to their target and cause inflammation. If enough of these autoantibodies accumulate, the inflammatory response can lead to the symptoms of MS. In some cases, such as those who have multiple sclerosis, the disease itself may not show any signs at all until the immune system has been damaged or weakened.

Q: What causes autoimmune diseases?

A: Bacteria and viruses can trigger an immune response called autoimmunity. This type of inflammation occurs on a cellular level. It usually starts within certain parts of the brain called the central nervous system (CNS). Over time, the immune system can become overactive and cause widespread damage throughout the body. The damage is usually irreversible. When the inflammation reaches the lungs, nose, skin and eyes, the results can be deadly.

Q: Do the symptoms vary from person to person?

A: No. Most people with MS do not experience any major changes in their daily life while they have MS. However, if you develop the debilitating effects of MS, you will notice something different in yourself every day. For example, you might start to have trouble walking or talk normally (dysarthria), lose your balance, feel tired often, or have difficulty speaking. You may also experience problems with vision or hearing, including blurry vision, loss of hearing or difficulty hearing.

Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis: Typical Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis

The most common symptoms of MS include:

Visual disturbances, including blurred vision. The visual field is defined as the area around your eye where images appear sharp and clear. Flashes of light and darkness occur around objects you see or even just inside your field of view.

Changes in muscle control and coordination. Your ability to move your joints becomes impaired, leading to problems with your breathing, bladder control, and speech.

Balance problems. Your muscles tend to weakly contract and relax, causing stiffness. You may find it difficult","This is a very important question, and there are some circumstances that may help with this. If you have multiple sclerosis and your child has the disease or an affected parent or sibling, they may be able to pass it on if you're not careful. The most common way to do this is by using an enzyme called Factor VIII (FVIII) to repair damaged DNA in your body. However, sometimes this isn't possible. Other people who inherit genetic mutations that cause multiple sclerosis can pass their genes for the condition onto their children. In these cases, the child's mother or father could pass the gene on as well. It's also possible to pass the disease to another person through blood transfusions. Ask your doctor about whether FVIII therapy might be appropriate for you and your family.

Q: How often should my child have his/her spleen biopsied?\nAnswer: Spleen biopsy is usually done every three years, but occasionally it's recommended at least once more. When spleen biopsies are performed, a small amount of fluid is removed from around the edge of the abdomen under local anesthesia. During the procedure, doctors remove cells that are likely causing symptoms, such as inflammation, scarring, or nodules. These cells are then sent to a lab for analysis. Your child will need to go home after the procedure so that he or she won't have any complications. The length of time your child needs to stay home depends on how severe the symptoms are. Most patients return within two weeks, but it's important to keep track of the results of your son or daughter's test so that you can monitor treatment progress. Tell your physician if your child's spleen is clear or cloudy, or if you feel uncomfortable during the procedure because of discomfort caused by the needle. It's also a good idea to let your physician know if any symptoms appear while your child is being treated.","The risk of having MS in your family is extremely low. There are a number of factors that increase the odds of developing MS later in life, including age at onset and exposure to environmental toxins or medications. Although it is possible for a person with an inherited form of MS (usually referred to as ""genetic"") to have MS later on, this has not been documented in clinical studies. Other risks include birth defects due to genetic mutations or environmental agents such as chemicals during pregnancy, or exposure to toxins from smoking or asbestos during childhood or adolescence. It is also possible to develop MS after receiving certain drugs that affect the immune system, particularly when used by people who do not have adequate levels of T cells. Finally, some women may become pregnant while taking immunosuppressant drugs. In rare cases, these drugs can cause birth defects.

Q: Why should I get vaccinated before getting my MMR shot?

A: Most children will receive their first dose of MMR vaccine prior to going through puberty. Some pediatricians recommend delaying the second dose until the child's 9th birthday, but others think that delaying both doses provides sufficient time to build up immunity. Many vaccines are given to young children between 3 months and 2 years of age. These vaccines include diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine (PCV7), Hepatitis A vaccine (Pneumovax H1N1), meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MenACWY), pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PSV4), rotavirus vaccine, rabies vaccine, varicella vaccine, chicken pox virus vaccine, pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine and yellow fever vaccine. Children should be routinely monitored for any signs or symptoms of disease caused by these vaccines and for the development of allergies to them or to egg proteins contained in the vaccines themselves. In addition, there is concern about acquiring vaccine-induced encephalopathy (vaccine-associated encephalomyelitis/encephalopathy). This occurs when an otherwise healthy individual develops neurological problems related to the brain inflammation caused by vaccination. An estimated 30% of cases involve infants and younger children and up to 40% of those affected die within 3 weeks after being diagnosed. Most individuals with vaccine-induced encephalopathy recover completely without long-term disability, and most deaths occur in the 1st year after diagnosis. If you think your child might be"
81,Question: Can I work and study full-time with multiple sclerosis?\nAnswer:,"Yes, but your doctor will need to check your history of MS before you start.

Q: How long does it take for my body's immune system to recover from MS symptoms?

A: The effects of MS on the immune system can be slowed by certain medications or treatments that are taken during recovery time. For example, if you have received immunosuppressive therapy (for example, corticosteroids or steroids) while recovering from MS, the amount of cytokines produced may not be as effective in suppressing disease activity. Your immune system may also be slower to respond when it senses a new infection or antigen (foreign material that triggers an immune response). It takes around two years for your body to repair any damage done after the initial attack of a disease. After this, it usually takes about 12 months for the brain and spinal cord to heal completely. During this time period, you cannot do physical activities such as exercise or sport. You may be able to resume physical activity later on, though treatment is still recommended. If you experience fatigue, headaches, nausea, changes in vision, numbness or tingling, weakness, muscle pain, joint stiffness, persistent problems swallowing, or hearing loss due to MS, contact your physician right away.

Q: Does my medication affect the rate at which my body heals from MS?

A: Medications used to treat MS do alter the course of healing. Some medications increase the risk of infection. Other drugs might interfere with how your body uses vitamin D (see Vitamin D section below). These medications also might interact with each other, so it is important to discuss them with your healthcare provider before taking any medicine. In addition, some medicines used to treat MS may cause side effects, including: liver toxicity; diabetes mellitus; dizziness; depression; dry mouth; heart arrhythmia; increased blood pressure and heart rate; nausea; insomnia; constipation; skin rashes; seizures; weight gain; vomiting; diarrhea; and trouble breathing. Contact your medical professional if you think these drug interactions could be affecting the healing process.","There are a number of options. For example, some MS patients can take medication to control the symptoms while continuing their studies. Others may be able to complete both their MS treatment and their studies at the same time (and vice versa). In either case you should discuss your concerns about this plan with an oncologist who has experience in managing multiple sclerosis.\r


Some people have been able to successfully manage multiple sclerosis using oral medications that act like steroids. These medicines include prednisone, or Exondys 52®, prednisolone acetate, methylprednisolone acetate, and methylprednisolone sulfate. Other doctors use immunomodulatory drugs called autologous blood products -- vaccines given by a doctor directly into an individual's own bloodstream rather than through a vein. Because these drugs do not contain corticosteroids, they generally don't require daily injections. However, these types of drugs still must be taken consistently throughout the day. A patient might start one dose of one type of vaccine at 5 p.m., then stop for lunch at 8 p.m. If he misses his vaccine, another injection will likely need to be administered shortly thereafter. A common complication of these treatments is allergic reactions. It's important to talk with your health care provider before giving any immunosuppressive therapy to any person.\r

What is my monthly window of opportunity?

The first month after the diagnosis of MS is also the most difficult one to treat effectively. Your MS physician may recommend starting treatment within 1 week of the first symptoms, but many patients find it very helpful if they wait until 2 weeks of new onset, because that is when the immune system has had enough time to build up strength for the next phase of treatment. Most doctors prefer to begin treatment with TNF inhibitors, which block T cells and reduce inflammation. Some doctors say that beginning treatment right away allows more room for improvement as your body gets used to your new disease. As long as your T-cell count stays under 10,000 per milliliter of plasma, doctors usually recommend waiting 6 months before moving to anti-inflammatory drugs such as interferon alpha. Interferon alpha reduces inflammation, and is often recommended for patients who've already started receiving steroids.


How do I know if I'm ready to get started with therapy?

The sooner you begin treatment, the better off you'll be. Patients often ask how they can tell whether they're ready to try to quit smoking; the same advice","Yes. The MS Society of Canada (MSC) has developed guidelines that allow you to work or study in a variety of roles, including research, teaching, administration and service activities, including as an administrator at a university campus. You can find more information on these guidelines here.

Q: What kind of research is done at the University of Toronto for people with Multiple Sclerosis? A: Currently, one research project involves a small group of patients who have been followed from the onset of their symptoms through the development of disability. This project seeks to determine if the immune system plays a role in maintaining the severity of symptoms during early stages of disease. This type of research does not involve clinical trials and therefore cannot be conducted outside of Canada.

The MS Society of Canada works closely with many groups across the country to support all aspects of MS research, such as grants, training opportunities, and collaboration with health care professionals to provide the best possible quality of life for everyone affected by MS. More information about our involvement in MS research can be found below.","You can. Most employers allow it, but some employers do not permit you to take two or more classes at the same time. Your college/university may require you to have a minimum of 12 credits in your major before you can get a degree (or complete a minor). Check their website for specific information on requirements. If you're interested in taking courses on campus (e.g., through the school's online program), make sure they are approved by both the College and University.

Q: Where should I start my MS coursework? How much does it cost?\r


A: Some people who suffer from severe MS symptoms will be able to begin treatment immediately. Others won't be able to finish any kind of treatment until they're better. If you think that your condition is so bad that you might not be able to complete even a few days of therapy, consult with your doctor about where you could go next. The first year after diagnosis usually costs $25,000-$30,000 per year for an individual. Depending on your insurance coverage, this can range anywhere from $15,000-$20,000 per year. If you don't qualify for financial aid, you may need to borrow money yourself. Your treatment plan will include a pre-treatment evaluation where you'll be evaluated as well as regular followup visits throughout the course of your treatment. It's important to remember that you must continue to see your doctor if you have any problems while completing your treatment plan. However, there are many resources available to help you find out more about MS care options.

Q: Are there any other things I should know before starting my MS treatment?\


A: For most people, the first month of treating MS isn't particularly difficult. But over the next several months you will experience the following changes: loss of feeling in hands and feet, muscle spasms and weakness, memory problems, difficulty speaking, difficulties with movement and balance, confusion, fatigue, vision problems, and mood swings. These changes are often accompanied by other symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, fatigue, shortness of breath, weakness, numbness, and sensitivity to light. Some people report having more than one symptom during the course of treatment; others have only mild, intermittent symptoms.

If you have a job that allows you to use your disability compensation benefits as an excuse to do so, then you should make sure you apply.

You must give the employer notice about the need to stop working, at least one month before you quit (i.e., not more than 15 days). The employer may ask you if you are ready to go back to work immediately; if you say no, there is nothing illegal or wrong with your request for a flexible schedule. Your employer should allow you to take a leave of absence without pay. (See ""What is my FMLA leave rights?"" below.)

Doing something else while using the leave will NOT be allowed by your employer unless it has been authorized under federal law. For example, you cannot work at another job while on FMLA leave until after your leave ends (unless your employer gives you permission to continue working there during your period of leave) or return from FMLA leave. In these situations, you should contact your union representative to discuss your options. See Chapter 10 of this publication for more information.

Does a doctor's note mean I am healthy enough to work?

No. A doctor's note does not imply that you are not sick. However, doctors are required to advise their patients about health risks when treating them. Some medical conditions require special precautions (including medication) that could affect how well you perform your duties at work. Contact your physician if you have questions or concerns regarding any aspect of your condition.

Can I come back to work after taking leave because I get worse or feel better?

Yes. You can keep working even though you are getting better or feeling less tired. When you are unable to work because of a physical or mental illness, your doctor has advised you that you should try returning to work a few weeks later, perhaps following a break in treatment.

Some illnesses can lead to symptoms similar to those that occur during a short leave, such as headaches, nausea or fatigue. You might recover completely after a few weeks without going off work, but it is important to seek medical attention promptly if you think you are experiencing symptoms related to your disease. As long as you tell your supervisor or HR office when you start having some of these symptoms, they'll notify you in case it becomes necessary to stay home to rest. They also may help you arrange transportation to","Yes, as long as you are able to complete your studies on time. You must be enrolled in an approved MS clinic for which there is a clinical research project and have sufficient funding available from the NIH or other sources (e.g., private funds).

Q: My husband has MS, but he works at home most of his life. He says that's fine because he gets home only once every four months to cook. How do we make sure this doesn't affect his ability to function? Answer: Your husband can continue to work part-time if he can keep up his current workload without much difficulty. It may also help him if he chooses not to go into paid employment until he has completed his residency training. The NIH recently issued guidelines stating that part-time employees who meet certain criteria should be allowed to continue work in their areas of speciality while they continue completing their residency training. In addition, if you believe your spouse can better manage his/her responsibilities and income while working part-time, you might consider providing additional support during and after residency by paying part of his/her salary directly to the MS clinic where he/she practices. For more information, please contact us.","Yes. Some conditions will keep you from working, but there are other ways to improve your quality of life. For example, you may be able to take time off from work for physical therapy or medical appointments if you need it (some employers will allow this). There is no limit on how long you can stay in school, though most people start their studies at the age of 21.

Q: How much time does it take to learn a new skill? \nHow long does it usually take me to achieve my goals/goals? Answer: With some skills it takes months to become proficient, while others may require weeks or even days to accomplish. Each person's level depends largely upon his or her motivation and ability. If motivated and able to focus, any amount of practice should produce good results. You can use our Skill Ranking Calculator to find out how fast you could reach certain levels of proficiency.

Q: What types of disabilities do you support? \nWhat programs or services provide these supports? Answers: We have two main kinds of disability benefits. Disability insurance protects people with chronic health conditions, such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, and HIV/AIDS, from losing their jobs or seeing their income reduced because of an illness. In addition, all workers must now carry health coverage regardless of whether they're insured through their own employer or on the job. The Social Security Administration oversees disability policy and administers disability insurance. It also has a program called Medicaid that provides supplemental health care coverage to low-income adults and children with serious illnesses. Our Health Coverage Map shows where people who qualify for social security disability, Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children's Health Insurance Program live. A person qualifies for one of those programs based on his or her income alone, not on whether he or she has one of a number of qualifying disabilities. People can change their eligibility status anytime during the year by filing a tax return using Form SS-5, Application for Change in Status. Many states grant more generous means testing to help pay for services. As long as a condition exists, anyone who has it would be eligible to apply for the appropriate assistance. If you believe a state's benefit structure discriminates against someone with a disability or if you believe you're being denied important services due to your condition, contact the organization representing your interest at 1-800-772-1213. Other resources include the National Association of State Mental Health Directors, which operates as a clearinghouse for information about local mental health agencies; the National Alliance on","Yes, but not in the same building. The MS Society does not offer any financial assistance to students who have multiple sclerosis. There is also a need for a space that can accommodate many different kinds of groups – sports teams, student organizations, faculty/staff, etc., so if you are interested in becoming part of this campus culture please contact: Student Life Services (sls@nsf.edu).

Can I work and study full-time with multiple sclerosis?\nAnswer: Yes, but not in the same building. The MS Society does not offer any financial assistance to students who have multiple sclerosis. There is also a need for a space that can accommodate many different kinds of groups – sports teams, student organizations, faculty/staff, etc., so if you are interested in becoming part of this campus culture please contact: Student Life Services (sls@nsf.edu). How will my medical insurance be paid? The MS Society has a $2,500 cap on the total out-of-pocket expense (such as copays, deductibles, co-pays) it covers per calendar year, which means that even when your insurance doesn't cover everything, your bill may still be minimal. If you plan to stay at NSSF for more than one semester, we recommend that you apply for supplemental insurance coverage through the NMS Center, or through NMS HealthNet. You will receive an estimate for what you would pay over three years from our policy experts. If you do not qualify for supplemental insurance or insurance through NMS Health Net, then you must pay for medical services directly out of pocket by paying the monthly bills or by going into debt. Note: the MS Society does not provide financial support to students who attend classes at other universities or institutions. Students who live away from campus should consult their individual health care providers regarding insurance coverage options.

Q: My doctor says my condition is incurable; can I get a new prescription every 3 months so the doctors will stop writing me prescriptions for MS drugs?

A: You may be able to use your existing medical records as a guide to decide how often you want to have a new doctor review them. However, it's not an easy decision because each person's situation is different. If you need medication to help control symptoms, talk to your physician about whether this is appropriate. Also note that many medications will have side effects in the long term, even if they're prescribed properly. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you don't understand why certain medicines aren't working right now.","Yes. The MS Society does not have a set limit on the number of hours you can work, although we do recommend that you avoid working over 60 hours per week, since this could increase your risk of developing another autoimmune disease (such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis). However, some people are able to function fully employed in all their activities while managing multiple sclerosis. In addition, there is currently no evidence suggesting that a lack of sleep impairs mental performance.

Q: Are there any restrictions to working with MS patients?\nAnswer: There are no limitations on how long you may be able to perform full-time, non-medical duties at your job if you do not work with MS patients. You should discuss with your physician whether taking medication for other conditions (for example, thyroid problems) makes it difficult for you to perform these tasks safely. If you need medications, please inform your health care provider before becoming involved in patient care. It is best to inform your doctor or occupational therapist about your situation so they will know what tests to order when necessary. They will also ensure that you receive appropriate training and support.

Q: What is the range of daily functions you can perform without limitation?\nAnswer: Some areas of daily activity, such as dressing, eating, sleeping, grooming, bathing, reading, writing, talking, and playing games, require no special skills beyond basic communication. For others, such as driving or operating machinery, simple motor skills are required to operate safely. Other areas of daily functioning, such as cooking and using computers, involve learning skills which develop over time to become more complex. These abilities include making choices, remembering things, understanding instructions, speaking clearly, and following rules. To help prevent accidents, make sure that your employer has trained you appropriately in the proper use of equipment and in safety procedures.

Q: How much time must I spend doing my day's usual routine activities every day?\nAnswer: Most daily tasks take only 10 minutes or less to complete. Your work schedule and lifestyle factors may affect the amount of time you actually spend performing your normal activities, but you cannot significantly exceed those limits (see question #3 above).

Q: Should I wear a special type of protective clothing or eye protection during daytime work?\nAnswer: No, as long as you are protected from direct sunlight and are adequately covered by your overall garment, you should not be concerned. The sun damages the skin, causing suntan ulcers, and ultraviolet light"
83,Question: Why get episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis?\nAnswer:,"Most people who have MS already know that they have the disease. It is important to educate patients about their diagnosis and what they can do to control their symptoms.

Q: What are symptoms associated with relapsing-remitting MS?\nAnswer: Relapses typically involve worsening of disability in a person's arm or leg, and some people experience both legs become weak or lose their ability to walk. They may also develop vision problems such as double vision, changes in depth perception (such as blurred vision) and headaches. In addition, relapses often result in fatigue and cognitive decline, although these symptoms are usually less severe than those experienced during attacks of MS. People whose treatment response has been disappointing may feel like they might be having another attack.

Q: How does a patient with MS respond to an immune test to see if the body is fighting off an infection?\nAnswer: An autoimmune reaction occurs when certain white blood cells recognize foreign substances - especially proteins from bacteria or viruses - as invaders, making antibodies to them. Antibodies stimulate T cell activity. T cells can destroy the invading substance. The immune system works effectively only if the right mix of T cells and B cells (natural killer cells) identify and kill all the infected cells. Thus, there must be a balance between antibody production and antibody production against pathogens. A positive result on a simple laboratory test used to measure this balance shows that the immune system has successfully eliminated the pathogen(s).","It's all about the patient. A neurologist is not a medical doctor, and doesn't have the expertise to know what you really need from a drug or therapy. And remember that your doctor may have their own biases and beliefs – they might be more likely to prescribe certain drugs than others (for example, they are more apt to see MS in women), and more inclined to use conservative treatment regimens.

It is important for you to discuss with your doctor any side effects you experience such as fatigue, nausea, dizziness, headache, muscle pain, insomnia, loss of appetite, and other symptoms that may be related to your multiple sclerosis diagnosis. Your doctor will want to understand why these symptoms occur after taking your medication regimen, and if you're having any positive/negative reactions, these should also be discussed with them. If you're experiencing negative side effects, ask your doctor how they can help you resolve these.


How many months did you stay on your drug regimen?

The answer here depends on the type of drug being used. For some drugs, like interferons, one month is normal. Some other medications, like Tysabri, may require six months of use before it begins to work effectively. Sometimes, an extended period of time between treatments is required because of research questions. In general, your doctor will tell you at this point whether your drug regimen has been working and whether there may be a longer term benefit in continuing. You'll then receive a letter detailing your results. You do not have to stop your drug regimen immediately; however, when you reach your goal dose for the next cycle, a new letter will be sent letting you know that a reduction or withdrawal of your drug could result in serious adverse reactions. This is especially true when stopping a long-term treatment protocol. If you decide to continue, then you must follow a strict adherence plan. These measures include regular blood tests and monitoring of your brain waves using an EEG device. If you miss a day's dosage due to illness, or are not meeting the goals set out in your prescription, you will be asked to drop back down to the lowest possible dosage, which could mean discontinuing treatment completely. You will never be able to get off a medicine without going through this process.

What are my chances of getting a relapse? How often does this happen?

Your relapse rate depends on several factors, including the severity of your disease and your history of MS. But it is likely that you will run into trouble again sooner or","In our experience, with more than 50,000 patients treated with CCSVI/MS medications (many for life), only 1% have relapsed or developed new problems. We believe that we are treating patients in the early stages of MS, and not later in the disease when symptoms are less severe. Our research has shown that one day of treatment can prevent relapses occurring within 3-6 months after the last dose.

Q: How does CCSVI affect your health?

A: It affects all areas of my body including but not limited to: vision, hearing, heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, immune system, brain function, bone density, blood sugar control, sleep patterns, stress levels, and many others. For most people, it is best if they keep their own records of what medication they are on, how much they take per day, and any side effects they experience from taking these drugs.","Multiple Sclerosis is a progressive disease that will eventually cause you to lose your sense of balance, walking and breathing. It is also known as ""sensory overload syndrome"" or ""neurological sensitization."" The main symptom of MS is numbness in the extremities (limb paralysis). However, there are many other symptoms such as weakness on one side of the body, severe fatigue, mental confusion, and problems with memory, speech and vision.

To date no cure for MS has been discovered, but there are treatments. One of the most effective methods is called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, which involves applying intense electrical current through electrodes placed on the head to reduce inflammation in parts of the brain involved in motor control. For those who have had enough from repeated treatment, the procedure can be reversed so they don't need it again. Although this therapy does not work every time, it is an option for some people who would otherwise die without it. This program may take months, but usually results in significant improvement in MS symptoms within three months. In fact, nearly 100% of patients seen during the first year of the study went into remission after going through the intervention.

Unfortunately, many people who experience long-term remission do not recover completely from their initial stages of the disease. Some continue to suffer from these relapses even after being treated. Therefore, researchers at Harvard Medical School recently decided to see if they could identify how people recover after a full course of the RTSS. They found that the risk of getting relapsing remitting MS was much higher among the group that completed only one year of treatment than among those who finished two years and a half of treatment. These findings are promising because they suggest that longer courses of treatment could help people return to normality sooner.

Original Research: Abstract for ""Relapse Risk after","Multiple Sclerosis is not a disease, it's the symptoms which are different than any other. You must first be aware that there is no treatment for MS and therefore every attempt to cure the illness should be stopped. If you have been told that you have relapsed then your Doctor or Neurologist will diagnose this condition with their own diagnostic criteria.

The first step in diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS) is to examine your medical history including:

Your current physical, mental, emotional, social and work difficulties;

Any previous symptoms of multiple sclerosis such as headaches, difficulty sleeping, tiredness, weakness, or numbness, hearing loss or problems with vision; and

If these problems continue after two years of having MS then your doctor may refer you for further assessment and testing.

In order to assess whether your MS has returned you need to make an appointment with your local Neurologists or Psychiatrists. The first stage is usually one visit where you sit down with your physician for a consultation. Depending on the situation, it could take up to three visits to find out if you are at risk for relapse again.


Once your neurologist has completed their evaluation they will prepare you for a full exam by performing tests which include:

An MRI scan using special X-ray equipment to check the brain structure and blood flow. This is sometimes used to monitor for changes in the production of certain chemicals in the central nervous system (CNS).

Blood tests to measure levels of hormones and neurotransmitters that affect the body. Some medications can interfere with these levels

A physical examination including checking the following areas of concern: Your eyes – for signs of glaucoma (damage to the optic nerve); Your ears – if you have had a recent ear infection (such as otitis media); Your spine – you may notice narrowing of nerves in parts of the spinal cord; A cervical disc - the outer layer of cartilage (lamellae) that covers the vertebrae in your neck. This often leads to pain when moving the head and spine; An abdominal area – for signs of abdominal discomfort, pain in the lower part of the back (abdomen), or loose stools; A tongue – abnormal tongue movement (tongue protrusion) associated with a number of conditions such as diabetes; Your heart rate – for signs of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmia) such as palpitations.

This helps your doctor confirm your diagnosis and identify any underlying causes of your","When you are in remission, the immune system (the body's natural defense against illness) is suppressed. You no longer have an ""attack-and-defend"" mode that causes your cells to attack your own tissues. This is why it is important for all MS patients to undergo regular testing before and after treatment. \n

There is a way of measuring if your immune system has been working properly. The term cytokinesis means the ""messenger molecules"" involved. These cytokines release chemicals called substances into our bloodstreams which cause disease symptoms or inflammation. There are two types of cytokines which play a role in relapsing MS. These are interleukins (IL) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa). IL is produced by white blood cells known as B lymphocytes. TNFa is produced by white blood cells called macrophages. Other factors such as the brain stem cell population can also produce these mediators.

The following table gives some examples of IL and TNFa.

Illustration of Interleukin 1 (IL1) and Interleukin 2 (IL2) being released during an autoimmune condition.","The person's diagnosis may be correct but there are many reasons why it is wrong.

Risk factors for MS include age, having had an accident or injury that causes nerve damage, smoking and drinking alcohol before the first signs appear, genetic predisposition (especially if the patient has one or more rare gene mutations), and viral infection (like AIDS).

Diagnosis occurs with a complete blood count and other tests to determine what type of lymphocytes and what other immune cells are present in the body.

The doctor also looks at specific features such as eye trouble, seizures, and hearing problems. If these symptoms persist after several years of disease, the diagnosis can change from ""multiple sclerosis"" to another neurological disorder.","Because if you are in remission and your symptoms have returned, then you should be evaluated for MS.

How it works: The study results showed that the patients who got a diagnosis of MS were significantly less likely to experience other adverse side effects than those who did not get diagnosed. This was especially true for those with autoimmune disorders such as Lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. It may also help explain why people who do not get diagnosed get better quicker – they don't need to wait for doctors to confirm that their symptoms are relapsing MS.

What's next: The study has raised hope that more research can lead to an effective treatment for people living with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). If the findings prove accurate, this could be a huge breakthrough for many people with CFS.","Because that's what it is. I have never been cured and I've spent the past 10 years living with the illness, so you can say for sure I'm not going to be any better next time. The only thing I do know is that every day is different, and it will never ever get easier, but it does make me appreciate life more each day.

Episode #19: How to deal with your friends who don't want to see you happy\ nQuestion: Do people really talk about how they're feeling when you're around them? Answer: Yes! It happens all the time! If someone asks ""How are things?"" chances are you're doing just fine; if someone else says something like ""I'm miserable"" or ""Everything sucks!"" then odds are he or she is trying to sound like a normal person. Don't be afraid to admit that you might need some help if you aren't quite where you'd like to be in life...because even though other people may think you're crazy, you probably ARE crazy.

Episode #20: What makes a great relationship between two guys in high school?\nQuestion: Two guys in high school, how would you describe a good friendship? Answer: A very good one. You go through periods where you might argue, have arguments, but once again, you understand why each other thinks the way we do. We don't judge our friends, because they are people, and that's what friendship should look like. We love to tell stories, laugh at jokes, and discuss our feelings. Our favorite times together are when we've had time away from our families. When we're having problems, we try to work out our issues before taking too much stress on each other. That's when the best friendships come into play.

Episode #21: How do you keep your body strong and healthy while still enjoying sex?\nQuestion: Is there anything that you find difficult in performing oral sex and/or vaginal intercourse? Answer: Not necessarily. Sure, there are a few nerves (and muscles) that aren't used during intercourse, but the end result is still fantastic. I enjoy pleasing myself both orally and vaginally. However, most people have a hard time getting off when you're doing those activities, especially if the partner isn't aroused. So my advice is this: Find pleasure anywhere you can. Get turned on by masturbation, reading erotic magazines or watching porn, listening to music or playing video games. This doesn't always happen instantly,","MS is a progressive disease, so the more symptoms you have, the greater your risk of developing full-blown relapses. By getting tested for MS and treating any active symptoms that return, you increase your chances of recovery and survival in the long run.

FAQs About Multiple Sclerosis"
85,Question: Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis\nAnswer:,"This is a very common complication that can cause a significant disruption in your daily life. It may require special attention and intervention by the health care providers to manage it. A patient's response will depend on many factors, including the severity of the problem. Therefore, you should refer them directly to an appropriate specialist for treatment and management.


Q4: What are the symptoms of relapsing remitting MS? Answer:

Relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) is a chronic progressive disability affecting at least two-thirds of people who have had MS for a long time. RRMS is characterized by recurrent attacks of demyelinating activity. The number of attacks varies from person to person depending on how severe their disease is at the beginning and how well they respond to treatment. These attacks usually last about 1 year. Most people with MS never recover fully after the initial attack but this does not mean they never develop the condition again. Most patients experience some degree of residual neurologic impairment. Some recover completely and some do so only partially. Symptoms vary according to the type of MS. In general, people with acute or later relapse of MS describe similar features as those described in earlier sections. Some symptoms include: pain in joints (particularly knees), headaches, fatigue, stiffness, muscle weakness, memory loss and vision changes. Others report numbness or tingling of feet and hands, problems sleeping, changes in personality, lack of concentration and problems with balance. Other symptoms include sensory disturbances such as hearing loss, smell loss and light sensitivity. Many people also experience cognitive difficulties which lead to decreased productivity and ability to focus.


Q5: How is RRMS diagnosed? Answer:

In order for a diagnosis of relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) to be made, it must first be established that there has been no improvement in the current course of the illness. If relapses continue into late adulthood or past retirement age, then a more advanced form of the disease, called secondary progressive MS (SPMS), may need to be considered. If relapses occur frequently after diagnosis, a less advanced form of the disease, known as primary progressive MS (PPMS), may need to be distinguished. The various forms of MS are grouped together under the rubric ""relapsing-remitting MS"" (RRMS).


To make a correct diagnosis, doctors look at a number of different signs, symptoms, tests and findings. To start with, it helps to know what a relapsing form","Yes

Q: What is the significance of having a positive MS/MSR?

A: Having a negative MS/MSR can signal that you are immune compromised, which can lead to further treatment. A positive MS/MSR is not a guarantee that your disease has progressed past its initial stage, but it may be helpful in identifying when you need more intensive therapy or other treatments.","Yes.

Q: When a child has had an episode of MS, how long does it take them to get better?

A: Generally this will depend on their age and level at diagnosis. A child with the most severe form may not improve for months or years.

At the time of diagnosis, children have a 50% chance of being able to return to full activity before they are 5-6 years old. At that point, their odds start to decrease again. In other words, if you've given your child MS medicines over the last 12 weeks or so (the recommended course), then your child is likely to be in remission by 3 years of age.

If you're unsure about whether a child can safely continue using medicine to treat MS, talk to their doctor.

Children who started treatment too late may benefit from some type of therapy, such as an immunotherapy drug, while others may need surgery to remove part or all of their brain stem.

Children's reactions to treatments

When you give medicine to a young patient, there's still often concern about side effects. Here we explain what's known about specific problems:

Adverse events of the first generation

There were two major types of adverse events reported in studies of first-generation drugs. These included allergic reactions – which could include swelling or hives – as well as psychiatric symptoms.

There was also increased risk for seizures, including those caused by epilepsy. The latter condition affects approximately 1 in every 2 million people.

The main cause of these risks is likely due to a chemical reaction between the first-generation medicines and the immune system. However, more research is needed into the causes of seizure disorders.

Another important problem was the possibility of serious heart damage and stroke. This occurred when some patients developed strokes after taking the anti-seizure medication carbamazepine. It is unclear why this happened, but it did happen.

In contrast to first-generation medicines, second generation medicines now used today are far safer than those originally approved and are usually safe even without any side effects. Still, they carry a higher risk of side effects, especially serious ones.

What are the new products?

Newer medicines for MS include:

Gleevec (Glivec) – available from Gilead Sciences. Glivec is a combination of interferon beta1a/beta2a and glatiramer acetate.

– available from","Yes, but it's not a disease. It's called remitted MS (also known as multiple sclerosis remission). Remission is when your immune system goes into remission and you no longer have any symptoms of MS. However, you may still get flare-ups from the MS or relapses from other autoimmune diseases that can lead to more severe disability.","[top]

Q18. I have heard that the primary treatment for MS is a type of immune cell called an antibody. How long can this be effective? Answer:

The ability to control multiple sclerosis with a single type of antibody may not last very long, especially if it's used too often or at high doses. If you're using more than one type of immunotherapy drug together, your chances of controlling your symptoms will decrease over time because the antibodies are working in competition with each other and fighting off their own cells. Therefore, it would probably make sense to stop taking any new medications for about six months before trying another type.


If you think you might need additional doses of one or two different types of drugs, talk to your doctor about switching to a more targeted approach. You could try something like switching from one class of immunotherapy drug (such as infliximab) to another. The next step would be to gradually increase the dose of the first drug until you achieve complete remission after the second drug has stopped working. This process could take up to three years. After three years without flare-ups, your doctor may recommend continuing treatment with higher doses and/or combining treatments with another immunotherapy drug. For more information on the most common immunotherapies, read ""What Is Immunotherapy?"" [top] Q19. Which immunotherapy medications should I use if my disease doesn't respond to one or both of them? Answer:

Your doctors aren't sure what causes relapses of MS, so they don't know which drugs are best for everyone who responds to one medication. Sometimes the combination of two or more immunotherapies worked better than one at first, but then relapse occurred. In these cases, keep using all four drugs. However, some people respond better to only one or two immunotherapies. So, be sure to ask your doctor which ones you should avoid when starting or stopping treatment. Also, remember to check with your doctor if you start or stop treatment suddenly while under the influence of alcohol. A drug in your system can interfere with how the immune system works. Q20. What does relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis mean? Answer:

It means that you get a temporary reduction in your disability over several months, usually lasting one to two years. Then it starts back up again within days or weeks, usually causing more severe symptoms. When someone gets a partial response to a drug, it's referred to as remission. Once we've seen","No. (See Question #7)

17. In","MS is a neurodegenerative disorder, with all the symptoms of other degenerative diseases such as cancer. We know that MS patients who have relapsed to childhood-onset disease relapse into it again and again (relapses are not uncommon in MS). There has been speculation for some time that there might be an environmental trigger which causes these repeated relapses. It was also suggested that environmental toxins may play a role. To our knowledge, there has never been any direct evidence linking chemical exposures to MS; however, we suspect that this is partly because people with MS do not often get exposed to high levels of pesticides or heavy metals.

A study by Poulton et al. [3] showed that blood samples from adults diagnosed with MS were significantly enriched in aluminium compared with those without MS. The authors concluded that aluminium, probably due to its breakdown product aluminium oxide, could promote MS development. This hypothesis had been advanced before. For example, Moseley et al. [4] pointed out that aluminium exposure in early life can influence immune function later on through its effects on autoimmunity. However, this was the first study which used urine analysis to look for aluminium residues. In addition, Poulton et al.'s sample size of six individuals did not allow the detection of more subtle differences between individuals than would normally occur if there was only one person per group.

In 1998, Gage et al. [5] reported that two subjects living near a large aluminium smelter in north Wales had developed MS over four years after exposure to dust generated by the factory. These results were subsequently confirmed by Kupffer et al. [6], who studied seven patients with MS and nine healthy controls. These scientists found increased aluminium concentration in both groups. Furthermore, the number of lesions associated with MS was significantly higher among the aluminium-exposed subjects. These findings suggested a possible link between aluminium exposure during the early developing period and MS later on. Moreover, they highlighted the importance of understanding whether aluminium plays a causal role in the genesis of MS. One year later, Kupffer et al. [7] presented further data showing that aluminium in drinking water was strongly correlated with the risk of having MS. It is well known that aluminium accumulates in our bodies. Since drinking water supplies are contaminated, we should keep a close watch over our use of this precious natural resource.

It now seems probable that aluminium exposure triggers MS development, although we still lack the information needed to confidently predict what impact this will have","Remitting MS with relapses is very rare in the United States.

Question: How many people have been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis? Answer: There are approximately 800,000 Americans living with MS.

Question: What causes MS? Answer: The exact cause of MS is unknown; however, researchers believe that a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors contribute to the development of this disease.

Question: What do I need to know about MS diagnosis and treatment? Answer: People with MS often experience symptoms that vary from person to person. For example, if you notice numbness or tingling sensations when your fingers move across surfaces such as a table, the first step is to talk to your doctor about whether these symptoms may be signs of MS. If you suspect that you might have MS, speak directly with your doctor about choosing treatments for you. Your doctor can explain what MS treatment options are available and help determine which treatments will be best for you. Your doctor can also advise you on things to eat, drink, smoke, exercise, use medication, or get tested for other health conditions that may mimic MS symptoms.","The study showed that remissions are no longer as frequent, but it's more difficult to determine the cause of the relapse.

Question: Is there a correlation between MS and high cholesterol? Answer: No. If an individual has either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, they can have elevated blood lipids because their body is producing insulin, which in turn helps control blood sugar levels. There is no evidence that patients with MS have elevated cholesterol levels. However, if someone has high triglycerides (fats), then they may be at risk for developing MS. A healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and fish oil are recommended by health care providers.

Question: When was the first time your doctor told you about MS? Answer: I'm 45 years old. My last physician took my records when I had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. He told me about it during our annual physical, which he would do every year. That was in 1977. Since then, I've only heard from him once, when I asked for his opinion on an exercise program that he suggested. He said I should get started right away. I did.

Question: Does MS affect my memory? Answer: Memory is impaired in most people with MS, although some individuals can retain information better than others. For example, one person's memory loss might not be noticeable to another person who experienced similar symptoms. Memory deficits tend to worsen over time and occur in any number of areas including vision, concentration, language, ability to complete tasks, judgment and coordination.","You are not a good candidate for relapses. The disease is progressive, so the immune system will eventually attack itself. A relapse of MS would be a major setback, causing you to lose your ability to work and travel.

Q: My son has multiple sclerosis, but I don't think he should have his own insurance coverage. How do I explain this to my insurance company? Answer: Your husband must prove that his child's health condition is directly related to his employment. If he can show this, then you may qualify for ""dependent coverage,"" which may include coverage for your children, even if they live outside of Michigan.

I've just completed my residency program and am in need of health care in order to take up another job as a primary care provider (PCP) with the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services. What kind of medical benefits can I get from Medicare? Answer: Medicare does cover many services, including most PCPs. However, it is important to note that there are strict limits on the scope of services covered by Medicare. These caps vary depending upon whether or not an individual is eligible for Medicaid. In addition, some PCPs may require additional funding through private insurance plans such as Medigap (also known as managed care), though there are several organizations who provide these services free of charge to patients with MS.

Can I use a third-party payer during my residency? Answer: While many insurance companies will cover your expenses for a full year while you're still working at home, others may require you to submit proof of your income before covering any out-of-pocket expenses, and many third parties only cover a portion of what Medicare covers. As a rule of thumb, the more cash you make, the less likely you are to receive coverage. Also, remember that certain medications must either be bought through the government or purchased from a private insurer, so please contact us for assistance if you have questions about purchasing prescription drugs or other health services.

Is there a special way to tell when my symptoms improve? Answer: Yes. Symptoms of improvement begin to appear soon after starting treatment. In fact, symptoms may be evident as early as 10 days following diagnosis. Most often, however, improvement takes place within 3 months of the initial diagnosis. Symptoms may also start sooner if you experience fatigue, pain, mental confusion, loss of muscle control, or cognitive problems.

Why isn't MS treated like cancer or heart disease? Answer: Multiple Sclerosis is the second leading cause of death"
86,Question: Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis\nAnswer:,"Yes, it's a progressive disease.

Question: Secondary progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS) Answer: It is a common form of MS that develops in childhood or adolescence. The main symptoms are numbness and tingling on one side of the body and problems with walking.

Question: Spinal cord injury and MS Answer: There are many causes of spinal cord injuries, including accidents and violent trauma. In children, spina bifida, tetraplegia, hemiparesis and congenital adrenal hyperplasia can all lead to MS. Some researchers believe that some types of traumatic brain injury (TBI) may contribute to MS. Other conditions that have been linked to MS include head injury (including drowning), stroke, myelopathy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Question: Sudden onset chronic fatigue syndrome (SOCF) Answer: This is a common condition that affects about 1% of people aged 65 years old and younger. Symptoms can last from a few weeks to several months. People who experience sudden onset chronic fatigue syndrome (SOCF) usually report feeling tired, having trouble sleeping and being constantly fatigued.

Question: Stricturea Answer: According to the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), strictures are small tears in the membrane that covers blood vessels inside the skull. When these tiny holes are filled with fluid or air, they cause pain and sometimes bleeding. A stricture can also allow fluids into a person's brain, causing swelling of the skull or brain.

Question: Stroke Answer: The risk for strokes depends on the type of stroke (for example, hemorrhagic vs non-hemorrhagic), age at the time of an event and whether other significant risk factors exist. Strokes that occur after an underlying heart problem such as coronary artery disease, high cholesterol, diabetes mellitus or angina may be more likely to affect older adults than others, because of the greater likelihood of heart attacks and death. More research is needed to determine if any additional health benefits associated with getting regular exercise could offset the risks of certain kinds of stroke.

Question: Stress Answer: As you age, your immune system becomes less effective against infections. Although this decrease in resistance to infection contributes to aging, it also increases your chances of developing medical conditions such as depression and anxiety. Having low levels of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline can help improve these physical and mental health issues.","Primary progressive MS\nDescription: This is a clinical syndrome of relapsing-remitting MS in which the disease flares up and then resolves. It's characterized by abnormal inflammation, called demyelination (the destruction or weakening of myelin), and often affects many areas of the body. Symptoms can include pain, stiffness and tingling, especially in the hands and feet. The disease progresses slowly. The condition typically occurs after age 30.

Q: What is secondary progressive multiple sclerosis?\nAnswer: Multiple sclerosis is one of the most common chronic diseases affecting people aged 50 to 80 years. People with this condition are said to have had an initial attack that caused symptoms similar to those seen in rheumatoid arthritis but it didn't resolve on its own. Many people with MS experience fatigue, muscle weakness, memory loss, difficulty swallowing, bladder incontinence, speech problems, headaches, and vision changes. At any given time, 25% to 35% of individuals with MS also have osteoarthritis (a painful condition of the joints). Source: http://www.cdc.gov/mss/ms/symptoms.htm

Q: What causes primary progressive multiple sclerosis?\nAnswer: There aren't certain reasons why MS develops and no one gene has been found to cause it. However, several risk factors, such as smoking, obesity and being older than 40 years old, have been linked with an increased risk of developing MS. Another factor that appears to increase the risk of developing MS is exposure to toxins, including lead, arsenic, mercury, cadmium, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) such as TCE, DDT, PCBs and hexavalent chromium. These compounds can damage cells throughout the body. Source: http://webmd.medscape.com/viewarticle/735453_1

Q: How does secondary progressive multiple sclerosis differ from primary progressive multiple sclerosis?\nAnswer: A person may develop primary progressive MS at any point during his or her life; however, some people have symptoms for decades before they develop secondary progressive MS. In contrast, someone who has secondary progressive MS might not realize he or she is having a relapse until it is too late. Both conditions are characterized by slow progression. As well, there may be periods when multiple sclerosis attacks people repeatedly without causing any symptoms","Yes

2. What is the age range of MS patients?

a. The median age is 50 years, and there are about 11-14% younger than this;

b. In France, approximately 25-30% of patients are over 60 years old;

c. The average age of French MS patients in 2003 was 65.3 years, and the number with onset between 1982-1982 and 1995-1996 were 28%;

d. Among all French MS cases diagnosed since 1982 until 2007, 2/3 (73%) had an onset before the age of 20 years, 1/5 (13.8%) after 30 years, and 9/17 (46.6%) after 40 years.

The incidence of MS increases significantly as one gets older in different regions of Europe. For example, during 1990-1997, the rate of MS among people aged 35 to 39 years increased from 14.7 per 100,000 persons in 1990 to 24.4 per 100,000 persons in 1997. During 1998-2007, the increase was even more pronounced: from 19.0 per 100,000 persons in 1999 to 34.9 per 100,000 persons in 2007. These figures for men and women have been derived according to the population structure in the same country (see Figure 3).

In countries such as Austria, Germany, and Italy, the prevalence of MS has remained relatively stable at around 8%. But in the United Kingdom and Ireland, a significant number of people with MS are beginning to show signs of the disease while still young and healthy. As shown in Table 1 below, these two groups accounted for almost half (47.4%) of the total numbers of individuals with MS in 2006, which is a higher proportion than seen in most European countries.

My mom was given an opportunity to ask any questions about MS. She is 74 yrs old, lived through all of her kids' treatments, has always taken care of herself with natural foods and exercise, etc., until she got to my age when she realized that her neurologist wasn't going to cure her.She went back to him and he did not even want her to go back to him, so she went off his medicine.

What would the other 5 months be like?And how long is the normal course of the disease?Please help!!

A: It looks like your Mom knows more than you know, because she wants to know if there's a way to give up medicine. But the only thing that could ever ""cure"" MS is to stop taking medicine permanently, which may never happen. Even then, she'd probably still have some kind of relapse. She should talk to her doctor right away about getting off medications, but it'll probably take time, not less than 6 months.

References","The answer is yes. But the exact cause of MS and how it develops are still unknown, and research continues in an attempt to find a definitive answer.

Q13: How long will my body's immune system be able to keep me from getting MS? Answer: It depends on your genetic predisposition for developing MS. If you have a family history or develop other autoimmune disorders (such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease), then the MS treatment may not work. Your body has mechanisms that will allow it to fight off any invading cells from outside your body. However, if you have no previous history of autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease, then your immune system might be too weak to effectively combat any potential infection that could trigger MS. Also, the more active your immune system becomes, the greater the risk of certain infections. However, even with these risks, scientists believe there is a ""window"" during which the body can respond by producing antibodies against those specific proteins that initiate inflammation and MS. In addition, some experts feel that if the body's immune system isn't well prepared to handle certain types of bacteria, viruses or parasites, then it may not be able to deal with them as quickly. So, although we don't know what happens after this window closes, you should try to avoid people with infections because they're just another possible source of MS triggers. Another way to prevent MS is to take high doses of vitamin C. A small percentage of people who develop MS have the metabolic disorder MTHFR gene mutations that make it difficult for their bodies to absorb vitamin C properly. This means that when they eat foods containing vitamin C, they don't get enough of the nutrient.

Q14: Is it true that I might suffer from PMS before or at the same time as having MS? Answer: The short answer is that you might experience PMS symptoms as early as the first year following diagnosis of MS. More research needs to be done on this relationship.

Q15: Does my age affect my chances of developing MS? Answer: No. All forms of MS are equally common among young women and men over the age of 40. However, older adults (those ages 65 and up) have about four times the risk of developing one type of MS than do younger individuals. That said, researchers aren't sure why this is so.

92,Question: causes of fatigue in MS\nAnswer:,"a long list, but they include ""poor"" nutrition and lack of sleep.

Q: What are the treatments for chronic fatigue? Answer: not well understood by researchers at this time. Some studies suggest that exercise might be useful in treating fatigue (a study from 1991 showed improvements after 12 weeks). Other studies have shown no improvement in patients with ME/CFS, but do show improvements in other illnesses such as HIV-infection. Most importantly, research has found that there is very little evidence to support any specific treatment plan or regimen for treating CFS or similar conditions.

Q: Are there drugs on the market for treating ME/CFS? Answer: yes. There have been several small clinical trials looking at the use of some of these medications for treating the condition. Unfortunately, all the trials were either stopped early because of inadequate results or were inconclusive. The most promising one was run by the CDC and reported positive results last year. It seems to work better than standard therapy but more research needs to be done. For now, please see our list below.

Q: Is there anything else I can do if my symptoms are so severe they make it impossible for me to function normally? Answer: Yes. Please talk with your doctor about getting screened for heart disease, diabetes, thyroid problems, etc. These factors may increase your risk for developing a serious illness like cancer, stroke, or premature death.

Please note: If you choose to get tested for cancer, hepatitis B, HIV, or hepatitis C, we recommend that you visit the CDC website listed above to find out more information. We also highly recommend that you get an annual physical exam (which includes a full blood count and lipid panel) before and after changing your medication schedule.

Our Top 5 Tips for Managing Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS):

1 – Get regular exercise. Exercise increases levels of endorphins which reduce pain and muscle stiffness (aka PEA). Endorphin levels go up when someone exercises hard enough (about 10 minutes per day). This helps reduce the intensity needed to cause the same level of pain and discomfort as before. Regular exercise is important even though you've tried different forms of exercise. There's no reason to give up trying, but try something new each week rather than doing nothing at all. In the meantime, try to avoid heavy lifting if possible. Instead, take 30 minute walks every day while wearing a belt. You should feel comfortable walking for just under 1 mile without cramping.","1) Chronic pain. 2) Painful joints. 3) Neurological disease, which may be neurological or a genetic condition (MS is caused by multiple genes). 4) Chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system. 5) Pregnancy and postpartum. 6) Inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's and ulcerative colitis. 7) Certain medications such as antidepressants that block neurotransmitter systems associated with fatigue. 8) The immune system. 9) Alcoholic beverages, alcohol-related cancers, and smoking. 10) A variety of other conditions, including arthritis, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. 11) Other mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. 12) Anemia, thyroid issues, and hypothyroidism. 13) Infections such as herpes simplex virus and genital herpes. 14) Diabetes mellitus. 15) Chronic lung disease and emphysema. 16) Hepatitis C, which can result from using certain drugs and having unprotected sex. 17) Cancer, including breast cancer. 18) Sleep apnea (frequent pauses between breaths during sleep), which leads to the frequent occurrence of snoring, among others. 19) Autoimmune disorders, such as lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, and Graves' disease. 20) Fibromyalgia and chronic back and neck pain due to spinal cord injuries. 21) Irritable bowel syndrome, as well as irritable bladder syndrome. 22) Rheumatic fever, an infection of the connective tissue. 23) Chronic pain after surgery, particularly for spinal disc herniations, for example. 24) Postoperative pain in patients who are undergoing chemotherapy. 25) Menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes and night sweats. 26) Gastrointestinal bleeding, especially if you have had recent surgery. 27) Endocrine problems such as diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels). 28) Neuropathic pain of unknown cause. 29) Obesity. 30) Acne, particularly when it occurs frequently or becomes severe. 31) Liver disorders. 32) Lymphoma. 33) HIV/AIDS. 34) High blood pressure. 35) Infections such as hepatitis B, C, and diphtheria. 36) Thyroid dysfunction. 37) Stroke. 38) Cancer. 39) Severe burns. 40) Epilepsy. 41) Peripheral","fatigue is caused by the inflammatory response to myelin damage, which can be triggered by a variety of factors.

Q5: what are some signs that an immune system attack may be underway?Answer: there is evidence that autoimmunity and inflammation play a key role in many diseases including MS.

Q6: are there any other symptoms related to autoimmunity or MS?Answer: yes, there are many symptoms associated with the development of autoimmune disease. Symptoms include fatigue, pain, tingling, numbness, muscle weakness, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, weight loss (especially in patients with multiple sclerosis), rashes, joint pains, skin lesions such as psoriasis. For more information about these symptoms read 'Autoimmune conditions'.","Treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome:

Lack of sleep is one of the most important symptoms that are experienced by patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. Although many people may have difficulty falling asleep at night, for those who suffer from this illness it can become a source of great distress and frustration. The majority of individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome report being bothered by problems with their sleep. A study carried out by scientists from the University of Exeter Medical School showed that 50% of people with long-term fatigue reported having trouble sleeping at least once per week. Sleep apnea (a condition where the breathing pauses during sleep) was also found to be common among these patients. Other potential causes include stress, poor diet or lack of exercise. Most commonly though, the cause of chronic fatigue is due to the breakdown in the central nervous system. This occurs when there is damage to the central nervous system leading to low levels of energy production, muscle weakness, depression, pain, loss of appetite, headache and cognitive difficulties.


As with most disorders, however, treatment depends on an individual's specific needs. For some people with the condition, rest and relaxation techniques such as meditation or deep breathing therapy help reduce anxiety, improve concentration skills and alleviate symptoms associated with mood swings and emotional upsets. However, other strategies including psychotherapy and medication may prove more successful at controlling certain aspects of the disease and improving quality of life for patients with MS.

[ back ] 44.2.13 - What is postural orthostatic tachycardia?

Q: what is postural orthostatic tachycardia (POTS)?

A: Postural orthostatic tachycardia (also known as POTS), is an irregular heartbeat, often described as a ""fast, shallow, short, high"" rate of heartbeat. It has been called the fastest growing medical problem since the 1980s, and statistics show that about 20 million Americans are suffering from it. At its worst, the condition can lead to dizziness, fainting, chest pains, nausea and vomiting, confusion, memory issues, dizzy spells, impaired coordination, sweating, nausea, fatigue, heart palpitations and even death. These symptoms tend to occur when someone becomes too upright, either because of physical or psychological reasons, such as sitting or lying down. Some people also experience them after standing up suddenly.


The reason why you might have this sudden onset of symptoms is a mystery, but researchers believe it has to do with a complex","The most important cause is lack of sleep. Most people sleep about 8 hours per day, but that's not enough to get their body going and keep it healthy. A good amount of extra sleep can help. It's a little more complicated than that though.

Question: Why do I feel tired after taking the sleeping pills? Answer: This happens when you're starting out on a new medication or after a few months. You might notice that your legs are feeling heavy and maybe even achy. That's normal because your body has started to adapt to the medications you've been taking for a while. If you take too much of a drug, you'll start feeling sick. Just remember that with all medicines, there will be some side effects. But overall, they should last no longer than two weeks. In the meantime, drink plenty of water! And eat plenty of food.","There are a number of factors that can contribute to increased fatigue. The most common is the use of other medications that increase your risk of developing MS, such as anti-seizure medication or certain antidepressants. In addition, there may be genetic and/or environmental reasons for your symptoms (e.g., you have been exposed to high levels of toxins from tobacco smoke, chemical fumes etc.). There also seems to be an association between MS and a certain strain of bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) which is found on the skin (i.e., sores).


The reason we ask about fatigue is because fatigue is often associated with MS, but not always. Most people who have MS will experience some degree of fatigue at one time or another, especially when they start their treatment regimen. However, it's important to remember that MS doesn't cause fatigue; rather, fatigue happens in response to a variety of things going wrong with the body. Some illnesses can lead to symptoms that resemble MS, including: infections (such as S. aureus infection); inflammation caused by viruses or fungal infections; immune system suppression; autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis; chronic pain syndromes; thyroid conditions; malnutrition (especially if you are malnourished); and many others.


One of the best ways to decrease your chances of developing MS by increasing your energy level is to eat well and exercise regularly. A diet rich in vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, and other minerals (including potassium), along with regular physical activity are all recommended to promote healthy joints and muscles.


For those patients who do suffer from fatigue, our team here at Columbia University has developed a program designed specifically to help improve their quality of life. Our goal is to restore your immune function so you feel better and live longer. We offer clinical training programs and individualized nutritional counseling, and provide both individual and group consultations to help you overcome any potential triggers that might make you more susceptible to MS.","I think the primary cause is a lack of nutrients (particularly vitamins and minerals) from your diet, which can be found in organic foods.

Q: What are some signs that my brain may have been damaged by MS? Answer: The most common sign is an attack of weakness or numbness to any part of the body. This occurs when the nervous system has trouble getting enough oxygen to cells throughout your body. It's also called ""spinal cord blockage."" A neurologist will examine you and measure your level of consciousness to see if you're having a stroke. If you do not regain full control of your arm and leg muscles after two hours, it means that your nerve connections between the brain and spinal cord have probably been damaged. Neurologists then try to repair these nerves with surgery. Another symptom of damage to your brain is confusion, difficulty speaking, loss of vision and/or balance, or memory problems.


Q: How long does it take for symptoms to resolve once I'm diagnosed with MS? Answer: Symptoms usually improve within one to three months.

Question: What is the cause of chronic fatigue and what is its onset? Answer: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a multi-systemic illness characterized by extreme exhaustion, sleep disturbance, muscle pain, fatigue, depression and cognitive dysfunction. It has been estimated that about half of all patients with ME/CFS have some degree of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The term ""Chronic Fatigue"" was coined by the National Institute of Health in 1989 to describe this complex syndrome. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this condition affects approximately 500,000 people in America and may be responsible for up to 15 percent of all disability payments made by Medicare and Medicaid. About one out of six Americans will develop some form of ME/CFS during their lifetime. The symptoms vary from person to person but include excessive fatigue, poor concentration, sore throat, malaise or fatigue, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. The most common manifestations are gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, constipation, abdominal bloating and nausea. There may also be neurological symptoms such as numbness, tingling, weakness, difficulty moving, and trouble speaking. Some sufferers experience recurrent headaches, which can last several days. Although it's difficult to distinguish between an autoimmune and infectious process, there is evidence that many cases involve both. Common symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis include fatigue and muscle spasms, particularly on one side of the body. The primary clinical diagnosis includes a combination of fatigue, joint pain, neuropsychological impairment, speech difficulties, blurred vision, difficulty walking or balance problems, and other neurologic signs. A number of studies suggest that MS is more likely to occur if someone has had a history of CFS. About 40% of those diagnosed with CFS eventually develop MS. The exact reason why some sufferers develop MS while others do not isn't clear, but researchers think that both conditions result from disturbances in immune system function. Patients often report experiencing flu-","1. Interstitial cell lung disease, including pneumonitis and bronchiolitis obliterans.

2. Pulmonary fibrosis (particularly with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).

3. Infections (especially pneumonia) that interfere with airflow to the lungs or cause other complications (such as disseminated intravascular coagulation).

4. Excessive or impaired oxygenation of blood by increased arterial resistance.

5. Overactive thyroid gland.


This is not a complete list. It is enough to know that a person may have one or more of these conditions before his/her symptoms develop. Also, this does not mean that there are only two types of MS -- all forms can be caused by certain underlying conditions.


It has been determined by others that some people are genetically predisposed to developing MS. For example, patients who carry mutations in genes for a protein called interleukin-10, which helps protect the immune system from invading the body's own tissues, have an increased risk for developing multiple sclerosis. Other researchers believe that genetic factors also play a role in many cases of MS. However, much research still needs to be done to understand the exact relationship between genetics and MS.

Q: What is the difference between Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson's Disease?

A: The primary differences between MS and PD are that MS generally affects individuals in their 20s to 60s while the majority of PD occurs at a younger age. In addition, the main symptom of both disorders involves problems relating to movement (a tremor) or balance (balance disturbances), whereas the symptoms of either type of motor neuron disease typically involve weakness on one side of the body. Although this distinction is important, it doesn't really explain why these diseases occur in different populations. As mentioned above, even within the same family, there is variation in susceptibility to MS and PD. There are also differences in how the cells are affected, including differences in whether they produce myelin, the protective insulation around nerve fibers; whether they use cholesterol, copper, iron or other substances that influence the ability of those nerves to communicate properly; and whether they produce proteins called amyloid plaques or tau tangles, which accumulate around nerve cells. Some scientists think these differences could account for why the disease occurs differently among different ethnic groups. They say that the white population tends to have higher levels of the ""bad"" protein associated with PD and a lower level of the ""good"" proteins involved in","chronic fatigue syndrome\r

Commentary: ""A placebo response would make sense when we think about the role of expectation in human behaviour. As people are made more and more accustomed to having a specific medication administered by physicians, their expectations will change. If they don't have an expectation that this medication will help them get through a long illness, then the placebo effect isn't going to work. This is why patients who were treated with placebos in trials often developed better symptoms than those not receiving placebos."" – Dr. Robert W. Saper

93,Question: Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?\nAnswer:,"This question has been investigated for more than 20 years, but the results are inconclusive. It is important that we do further research on this issue so as to find out whether there are links between MS and sleep problems or other cognitive or behavioral difficulties in older adults.

How many patients with Multiple Sclerosis have sleep disturbances?:

A few studies have reported an association between MS and sleeping disorders. In one study, researchers found that a quarter of persons with MS had insomnia problems. Another study examined 953 individuals with MS at the time of assessment and found that those with poor daytime sleep quality were four times more likely to develop MS. Sleep disturbance has also been associated with depression in both adults and children; in addition, some studies have indicated that chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) may be related to sleep disturbances.[3-6] However, it remains unclear if these associations hold true across the whole population.[7,8]

What is the relationship between MS and sleep-wake cycles?:

MS affects people differently depending on their age at diagnosis and how severe their symptoms become. The number of hours awake during each 24 hour period varies from person to person, ranging from 2 to 10 hours.[9] These different patterns of sleep can contribute to various behavioral and health outcomes such as reduced alertness[10] and increased stress levels.[11] Some evidence suggests that people who experience a longer waking window while living with MS tend to have better overall well being[12]. For example, subjects with a shorter average waking window had higher scores of positive emotions (self-esteem), social integration and life satisfaction, compared to their counterparts with a long wake interval. One potential reason for this could be that it takes longer for people to recover from an imbalance within the circadian rhythm system. People whose melatonin rhythms are disrupted may not properly adjust their sleep/wake cycle after they resume normal activity because their bodies have not yet fully adjusted to the new day's schedule.[13] Therefore, when you're working up a sweat during the day and have a full head of steam going in the evening, your body might not be ready to go back to bed until the sun comes up again. This is why it is recommended that people with MS take extra care around the clock to ensure that their daily schedules are flexible enough to accommodate their circadian rhythm fluctuations.[14]

The bottom line is that there are no definitive answers regarding the causes of MS. As MS progresses over time, your brain may begin producing less effective amounts of melatonin which leads to","It is possible. Multiple sclerosis has been linked with an increased risk of dementia, the most common form of dementia being Alzheimer's disease (AD) which affects 10-15% of patients over 65 years old.[7] Patients who develop multiple sclerosis are at increased risk for developing sleep apnea or obstructive sleep apnea.[8] Sleep apnea causes chronic low airway pressure that can lead to decreased oxygen levels and impaired cognitive function.[9]

Other factors may also play a role in the development of sleep disorders.[10],[11] The incidence of diabetes mellitus is often associated with a high prevalence of sleep difficulties.[12] This association suggests that there could be a link between sleep disturbance and other health conditions such as diabetes. In one study, it was found that people suffering from sleep complaints were more likely to have a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes than those without any sleep complaints.[13] Another example where sleep disturbances are associated with increased risks of cardiovascular events is stroke, although not all studies support this finding[14].","Yes. Multiple sclerosis can be caused by many things including sleep deprivation, poor diet, obesity, radiation, infection, chemotherapy drugs or other diseases and medications, and stress. Most of these things are often not recognized as contributing factors because they do not cause the disease symptoms but may affect a person's ability to function effectively at home and/or work. \ n

Sleep apnea is one such condition that can lead to multiple sclerosis. The main symptom of this type of sleep disorder is shortness of breath while sleeping. Other possible sleep disorders include restless leg syndrome (RLS), sleepwalking, and sleep-related seizures. Some studies indicate that up to 40% of patients with multiple sclerosis have some form of sleep disorder. \n

The most common reasons for daytime sleepiness include depression, anxiety, exhaustion, and poor quality eating habits such as skipping meals and overeating. In addition, medications like antidepressants and benzodiazepines that cause drowsiness also occur frequently among patients with MS. A number of medications used to treat MS also interfere with sleep. These include immunosuppressive drugs for leukemia, tuberculosis, HIV, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma; antihistamines, antipsychotics, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, blood pressure lowering agents, corticosteroids, antibiotics, immune boosters, and anesthetic drugs. Sleep medication use has been linked to more serious complications such as infections and stroke than nonmedicated treatment. \ n

It is important to understand that some types of sleep disorders such as insomnia are normal for the majority of the population even if they occur rarely. However, there are those who experience persistent or recurrent sleeplessness that cannot be relieved by taking prescription medications, which is considered a chronic illness. It also must be noted that certain forms of MS can make it difficult to fall asleep due to muscle weakness, fatigue, loss of coordination, nausea, vomiting, headaches, dizziness, and confusion. Many of these conditions are exacerbated when a patient remains awake during the night with only light levels being low enough to awaken them from sleep. For these individuals, using alcohol or stimulating substances before bedtime may help them fall asleep faster so that they can recover from their sleep disturbance. In any case, it is better to remain in your own comfort zone to avoid potential trouble during sleep cycles. \ n

Why should I call a doctor if I am having difficulty falling asleep?

There are several different reasons why you may feel tired or confused in the morning. Some of","Yes. In one of the studies, multiple sclerosis was associated with sleep disturbances as well as memory loss. Sleep disturbances are common for people living with MS; they may be a result of changes that occur during disease progression or other factors.[3]

Q: Are there any other conditions which might also lead to a reduction in cognitive function?

A: There is some evidence suggesting that depression can decrease cognitive functioning. However, this has not been replicated in clinical trials. The data from these studies does suggest that depression can contribute to decreased cognitive functioning. A few studies have shown an association between dementia and depression. This is most likely due to differences in how these two diseases manifest themselves. Both Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) involve disruption of brain cell communication in various parts of the brain. These disruptions produce many symptoms including fatigue, impaired concentration and difficulty making decisions. It seems possible that both AD and PD can affect different parts of the brain resulting in dysfunction related to memory. Depression could result from the stress associated with living with AD and/or PD.


Diabetes and Cognitive Function

Q: What types of diabetes medications should I take while taking MS drugs? Is it safe to use medications if you have no control over your blood sugar level?

A: For most patients, we recommend starting with the lowest dose that will provide adequate treatment. When using insulin, be sure that you're following all directions provided by your healthcare professional when administering your medication. If you experience side effects such as drowsiness, dizziness or lightheadedness on the drug (especially long-acting insulin), contact your healthcare provider immediately. Some medications can cause serious harm if taken improperly and even overdose. Always read the label, and consult your healthcare professional before beginning any type of medication.

Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking MS drugs? Do I need to limit my drinking?

A: Although there is currently no evidence that suggests that alcohol consumption negatively affects cognition, we do advise our patients to avoid excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages. Any activity that requires significant mental effort should be completed within 2 hours after stopping your meal or beverage.


How Much Sleep Do You Need?

Q: How much sleep do you need per night?

A: Most healthy adults require 7-8 hours of sleep each night, but younger children can get by without needing more than 6 hours of sleep per night. All individuals who live with MS should aim for at least 8 hours of total sleep per","Yes. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 1.5 million Americans, with over 100,000 new cases each year.[1] MS has been shown to be associated with sleep problems; for example, MS patients are reported to spend more time sleeping than other healthy persons, although they may also suffer from poor quality of sleep.[2] Sleep disorders are a risk factor for MS, but it is not clear whether these disorders contribute directly or indirectly to MS disease progression. Several studies have attempted to link MS with sleep disturbances by using subjective and objective tests of memory function.[3,4,5,6] However, no study has yet definitively linked MS to impaired cognitive performance. In addition, many aspects of MS, such as the number of lesions and extent of disability, have not been well understood when compared to normal aging. Therefore, our research group sought to examine possible relationships between these two characteristics.

Objective: To determine whether the presence of multiple sclerosis was associated with poorer performance on an abstract episodic verbal learning test (EVIDOL) among young adults without MS.

Design: A retrospective longitudinal survey including the use of EVIDOL, which provides a measure of declarative memory ability. The data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), followed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Linear regression analyses assessed associations between sleep variables and EVIDOL scores. Results are expressed as mean ± SD.

Results: Of the 24 participants, 21 had MS; 10 did not know they had MS. Compared with those who had MS, those without MS performed significantly worse on EVIDOL tests at baseline (P =.02); however, there was no significant difference between their average scores at baseline and following 3 months of treatment. There was no relationship between EVIDOL scores before and after treatment. These findings support the hypothesis that multiple sclerosis does not affect cognition specifically in MS-free individuals.","In the late 1970s, studies indicated that sleep problems were present in MS patients. The most significant problem was insomnia with a daytime sleepiness of 6-8 hours/night. These symptoms were reduced after oral melatonin treatment (10 mg). However, no evidence existed to support a link between sleep problems and other aspects of MS or any other neurologic disorder. More recent research is also pointing to an association between memory loss in MS and daytime sleepiness. However, there are still no clear answers to these questions because so little information is available on the subject, particularly regarding the potential links between fatigue and the development of MS. Another possible cause of this effect may be the use of drugs for insomnia such as Ambien which can increase REM sleep. This should be taken into consideration when assessing whether or not you need to use Ambien.

Q3: What are some other reasons why you may want to consider using sleeping pills in addition to those given above?

A: Sleep problems occur more commonly in older age groups than younger ones. As such it is essential that you look at what factors are limiting your ability to get enough sleep. For example, having trouble falling asleep is very common but it does not necessarily mean that you should try to avoid taking sleeping pills. It is important to remember that the effects of sleeping pills on the body and mind cannot be predicted from one person's experience alone, thus this issue requires much more rigorous study. People who have experienced difficulties falling asleep and who find it difficult to stop their bodies getting tired before going to bed may benefit from trying to fall asleep during the night rather than just during the day. Also, insomnia in the evening may be due to poor self-regulation. If you feel tired in the morning and then go to bed without stopping to rest, there will be a natural tendency to stay up and continue to work or take care of family members until bedtime occurs.

Some individuals will report feelings of being anxious about taking sleeping pills even though they do not wish to become drowsy. Some people may believe that if they take sleeping pills they would actually become drowsy although this may not always be the case. Sleeping pills do reduce levels of melatonin but in turn they also decrease dopamine levels which means that their effect on anxiety and depression are likely to be minimal. Thus, whilst this particular class of medications might make you sleepy it probably won't make you anxious or depressed.

The role of depression in sleep apnea

Q: Is there evidence that chronic sleep-disordered breathing (CDB) leads to major depressive episodes or affective disorder, like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder?\u003cAnswer: Evidence from clinical studies suggests that CDB does not produce major depressive symptoms but rather has an adverse effect on mood. There is also some evidence that the development of anxiety can be delayed by controlling the amount of oxygen consumed during sleep.

Sleep apnea is the most common cause of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). It occurs when air passes through the throat too rapidly, causing the muscles to relax while inhaling. OSA affects more than 30 million Americans, about one percent of the population, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Nearly all cases are related to tobacco use and obesity, although it's commonly misdiagnosed as narcolepsy. Many people who suffer from sleep apnea do so because they have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which causes airflow obstruction, leading to slow respiration. About 25% of those affected have a mild form of sleep apnea; 75% are severe cases. People with asthma and other respiratory conditions often develop OSA, especially if their airways become blocked by scar tissue. A small study published in 2015 found that patients with COPD had the highest rates of daytime sleepiness in the United States, followed by smokers with no chronic diseases.

Sleep apnea may result in depression, but whether this translates into suicide attempts remains unknown. In a 2007 paper in the Journal of Affective Disorders, researchers analyzed data from two large epidemiologic surveys that included nearly 5 million respondents. They found that among adults with mental health problems, there was an increased risk of suicide attempt in those with sleep apnea compared to nonusers. However, only 13 suicides were attributed to sleep apnea out of over 1.3 million deaths overall. This finding is consistent with previous research showing that both mental and physical health problems are highly prevalent in depressed individuals, and suggest that depression alone may contribute to suicidal behavior. Suicide ideation is another possible factor in these cases.

Symptoms of depression can occur in response to sleep apnea. Some people feel tired and listless when their breathing becomes shallow. Other people experience excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating at","Yes. The brain damage associated with MS makes it difficult for an individual to fall asleep, even when they are fully awake. For example, the person may wake up many times during the night because of pain or fatigue from a headache or muscle cramps. In some cases, people with MS will not get enough sleep at all without taking medications that help them fall asleep quickly; other individuals can have no trouble falling asleep but continue waking up several times every night due to physical activity or emotional stress.


Sleep Apnea is another problem that affects people with MS. It is characterized by repeated pauses or interruptions in breathing. Sleep apnea causes daytime drowsiness and often results in reduced mobility. This condition usually resolves within two years after it was first noticed, however, if untreated, frequent episodes can lead to permanent loss of balance and movement. People who have experienced long-term sleep deprivation can suffer irreversible effects on their bodies, including diabetes, heart disease, osteoporosis and cancer. \r

Symptoms of Sleep Problems in MS

People with MS experience a range of symptoms related to fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, difficulty concentrating, mood swings, memory problems, and more. However, in most cases, these problems occur alongside a host of other conditions such as depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, digestive issues, arthritis, and so on. Some people also develop chronic illnesses like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, or metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes. As mentioned above, many people who have MS report having more than one sleep disorder. They may be experiencing one particular disorder while still experiencing others. To make matters worse, different types of sleep disorders cause different effects. Although everyone has different patterns, one common symptom pattern seen in many people with MS is the following:

1) Insomnia – Difficulty staying alert and focused throughout the day. Sometimes this can result in being late to work or school.

2) Restlessness/Anxiety - Feelings of nervousness, fear, or excitement that arise throughout the day. These feelings may come from things like nightmares, hearing voices, having panic attacks, seeing objects out of focus or moving too fast, or feeling trapped in small spaces. A sleep disorder, whether caused by insomnia or anxiety, could increase these feelings.

3) Fatigue – Feeling tired all the time regardless of how much you exercise or take care of yourself. In addition to feeling fatigued","Although there is no clear evidence for a connection between MS and sleep, it is believed that the two conditions are related. MS patients frequently report difficulties in falling asleep or staying asleep (insomnia) and have difficulty remembering important events from their past.


MS may also cause memory loss. However, this can be prevented by taking medications called an anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen which block inflammation in the brain. This means that MS patients should not feel sleepy during the day and instead they will be more alert and focused during their days. Additionally, there is some evidence to suggest that regular exercise helps alleviate insomnia in MS patients. Therefore, avoiding stress may help reduce anxiety and keep MS patients from feeling tired at night.


Another reason why MS patients experience these symptoms is because of a lack of sleep itself. Some researchers believe that this may occur due to an imbalance in the body's natural clock system known as the circadian rhythm. The body produces melatonin when it receives certain cues from the sun. As this process begins around midnight, it becomes increasingly difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep until morning.


Researchers believe that many MS patients who do not have insomnia are having trouble falling asleep, but are unaware that they are not getting enough sleep. A recent study suggests that those with MS who sleep less than six hours per night are twice as likely to develop an autoimmune disorder. Many studies show that being more physically active improves sleeping patterns in people with MS. In addition, physical activity improves mood, reduces pain, and stimulates your immune system.


Therefore, being more physically active will reduce depression and improve sleep patterns while reducing fatigue. Being in control of your lifestyle and exercising regularly has been found to lower your risk for developing MS. It is best to make sure you eat well and drink plenty of water. Try to avoid alcohol. Alcohol consumption causes hyperactivity and affects your metabolism which decreases the effectiveness of melatonin making you unable to sleep naturally."
94,Question: When will I start to feel better with multiple sclerosis?\nAnswer:,"The best way to tell if you're getting better is by having your doctor check in regularly. If you still have a lot of symptoms, or if the effects are not as good as they were before your disease was diagnosed, then it's time for you to be evaluated by an MS specialist. If you do get worse after this initial evaluation and treatment, that means that your MS may need more intensive therapy. But in many cases your illness can improve over time without additional medication or surgery.

If You Have Multiple Sclerosis but Can't Get Diagnosed, Is It Too Late?\nThis isn't always true, though. If you've been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and treated aggressively so far, there's no reason why you shouldn't continue to improve. Your doctor may want to give you more information about how long you might need to wait to see a neurologist who specializes in MS. For example, when a person has a first attack of MS, the body usually responds well within two years and may never progress further. This is called a ""relapse"" period, because once the immune system gets into trouble fighting off the virus, the body goes back to normal. In most people who relapse, however, some of those antibodies also build up again at a later date, which makes the disease return even stronger. And the longer the person waits between the attacks of MS, the greater the risk of developing chronic relapsing-remitting MS (CRSM).

What Are the Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis?\nMS symptoms vary widely from patient to patient, depending on their age, whether they've had previous episodes of MS, and what environmental triggers have caused them. Some patients develop symptoms like numbness, tingling, or weakness in one or both arms and legs; others develop problems with vision, hearing, speech, balance, memory, and coordination. Others experience fatigue, dizziness, insomnia, blurred vision, pain, or loss of bowel control. Still other patients suffer joint and muscle pain, mood disorders, headaches, or difficulty swallowing. Many other symptoms may occur as a result of myelin-related disorders, including nerve damage, brain swelling, and neurological complications such as seizures.

How Can I Tell if My Brain Is Under Attack by Multiple Sclerosis?\nThe most important thing you can do right now to help protect yourself against the ravages of MS is to maintain a healthy weight. Having more calories than you burn helps keep the heart and lungs working properly and prevents damage to other","You may begin feeling better with MS symptoms in your first three months after the procedure. However, it is important that you do not stop taking your medications because of any side effects associated with multiple sclerosis or other health conditions.

Q&A: What is the treatment for Multiple Sclerosis?\nAnswer: A variety of medicines are used in various ways to help control symptoms. Some medications work on symptoms such as fatigue; others target the underlying cause of the disease, which can also be done by using nutritional supplements or eating foods rich in certain vitamins and minerals (vitamin C for example). Many medicines have side effects that must be managed. Most doctors prefer to use fewer medications rather than take more pills at one go to treat the whole person. But some patients do need more medication, so it's important to discuss this with your doctor. More information about the treatments available for multiple sclerosis can be found here.","It's not about how fast you feel better, but how much control you have. Your doctor can help you decide when and what type of treatment is right for your condition.

Q: How long does a single dose of steroids take to work?\nAnswer: Steroids need time to act. Typically, it takes between 8 and 48 hours for the steroid to be absorbed through the skin. As the steroids travel down the bloodstream, they enter into the cells. They are then taken up by immune system cells that eliminate them from the body. The effects of steroids begin within 24 hours, but their lasting effects may last up to six months.

Q: Is there any risk associated with steroids or use of corticosteroid medications?\nAnswer: There's a potential for increased blood pressure and cholesterol levels, as well as other risks such as heart attacks and strokes. However, there are many benefits associated with using steroids for MS. And the side effects usually aren't serious.

Q: What if my doctor tells me to stop taking my steroids after two weeks because they're not working?\nAnswer: You should discuss this decision with your health care team and ask what type of testing will be done before making an official withdrawal. If you continue on steroids, talk with your doctors again to make sure that they understand why you think they've stopped working. Also, keep in mind that even though your doctor says steroids don't work, he or she might still recommend using them, so always check with your doctor first.

Q: My family doctor said steroids could increase the risk of osteoporosis (bone thinning). Will steroids cause bone loss?\nAnswer: Steroids do not raise blood calcium levels. However, steroids do affect bone strength. So, men who are currently taking steroids may want to monitor their bones during the next three years while avoiding high-impact activities like lifting weights or exercising.

Q: Are there other ways to treat MS?\nAnswer: Most people find relief with medication alone. But some experts say taking drugs called biologic agents may also relieve symptoms. These medicines often involve combination therapy. They are used along with steroids to reduce inflammation and speed recovery from multiple sclerosis. Many experts now believe these new drugs can help slow or even reverse progression of MS. Biologics include cyclophosphamide, infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab and natalizumab. A similar group of drugs — known as immunom","The first symptoms of MS are usually acute exacerbations of the disease, so you should get your doctor's approval before beginning a diet or exercise program. However, many people recover fully without intervention within weeks, even months. If you have been diagnosed with MS and you're not experiencing any severe symptoms yet, it may be worth trying a diet that reduces inflammation in the body. The most common type of low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet is known as the Mediterranean diet, which consists primarily of whole grain foods (such as breads, cereals, rice, potatoes, pasta) eaten often together with olive oil, nuts, seeds, tomatoes, vegetables, olives, fish, poultry, and dairy products. Other types include vegetarian diets, which limit meat consumption; traditional Asian diets; and vegan diets. These dietary changes can help reduce your risk for developing MS-related brain damage by reducing excess inflammation. In addition to these simple dietary practices, exercise is another important factor in managing MS-related nerve cell damage. Researchers at Columbia University found that healthy older adults who exercised daily had significantly lower levels of plaque in their brains than those who did not exercise. The researchers concluded that regular aerobic activity improves neurogenesis and prevents the formation of plaque in the brain. They also reported that moderate intensity physical activity like walking five times a week has been shown to improve mobility, cognition, and quality of life in elderly adults.","When you no longer have a headache.

Q: When should I start taking my medicine for MS?\nAnswer: Never take your medicine if you are pregnant, trying for a baby or breastfeeding. Always read the label and follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

Q: Is it safe to use this medication after I've had a stroke?\nAnswer: Yes. If you haven't already started using an anticoagulant before having a stroke, wait until after you've recovered from your stroke and you're feeling well again. You don't need to stop all of your medicines immediately after having a stroke. Follow your doctor's instructions about when to resume treatment.","The first signs of your MS may be the most dramatic. You could have a stroke, or an aortic dissection, or even lose a leg, but you won't know it for sure until you begin taking medicine to suppress your immune system and lessen the effects of MS. If you are experiencing more side effects than normal during treatment, stop treatment immediately. In most cases, the side effects from starting medication soon after onset are mild.\n

Q: Why should I take my prescription medicine at night? \nAnswer: While medications can cause drowsiness, many people experience some of these symptoms when they sleep because their bodies need time to adapt to treatment. For example, if you're on a regimen that contains long-acting corticosteroid medicines, this means that you're likely going to be sleeping in deep sleep, which is important for maintaining healthy nerve function and reducing inflammation. However, if you don't get enough sleep, your body needs a break from the pain drugs. After one month off therapy, you might not wake up as well, since your body has not had enough rest. Don't worry -- this kind of insomnia doesn't last forever. Over time, you'll learn how to adjust to having less sleep. Once you've gotten used to that new schedule, you can return to a full schedule of sleeping 6 hours per night (a little easier said than done, we know). Be patient; you'll probably notice a difference right away!

How often do I have to see my doctor before beginning treatment?

You don't necessarily have to see your doctor every day while you're on MS medications. It's very common to have follow-up visits within 3 months. Your doctor might want to check your results if you didn't respond to your first dose of medications, especially if you haven't slept for 24 hours or more. At any point throughout the year, ask your doctor about how frequent he or she plans to visit you. A yearly appointment can help make certain that you're getting all of your MS medications under control.","It is not a guarantee that you will develop more MS symptoms at the same time. Each person is different and we do not know what the impact of multiple sclerosis on your body will be in the future, so it's best to wait until after surgery for evaluation and treatment.

Q: Will I have a lot of pain with my multiple sclerosis treatment?\nAnswer: No! There are many medical treatments available to manage pain during and after your MS treatment. You can see a physical therapist if you need additional help coping with pain. Ask your doctor or other healthcare provider about medications to reduce pain from MS.

Q: How much does my MS cost?\nAnswer: Your insurance may cover some or all of the costs associated with your MS treatment and these expenses are typically covered by Medicare or private health insurance plans. Contact your healthcare provider for more details.

Q: What will happen during my MS remission period?\nAnswer: The length of time in which you are unable to feel MS-related symptoms is usually known as your remission period. During this period of time, you should continue to take medications as prescribed. If you miss a dose, call your physician immediately.","This depends on the symptoms you have. There are two main stages of MS, active and progressive. In the first stage, your body is trying to clear out all of the damage caused by the disease. The second stage involves an accumulation of cells in areas that have become difficult for your body to heal, called relapses. You can be treated for both stages at one time. But there's no guarantee it will work because sometimes people relapse later when their immune system has been weakened.

Q: What happens if my doctor tells me I should stop working on my car?\nAnswer: Your doctor may recommend stopping your driving or other high-risk activities. If you continue these activities without consulting a health professional, they could cause permanent damage to your brain cells.

A woman named Anne Lohse had already suffered more than 20 strokes before she met her future husband, Charles, who was suffering from MS and was also disabled. ""I saw him walking through town on his crutches,"" she said. ""He looked like he'd never walk again."" He died two years after marrying her. (Courtesy of Anne Lohse)

This is because your body's natural healing mechanisms are working throughout the entire body, and your neurologist has a good idea of where they're most needed. You should continue to take medicine that helps you stay healthy and not stop taking it before your symptoms have improved or completely resolved.

Q: How much do doctors tell me about my MS? Answer: A doctor does not need to know your personal or medical information before talking to you about your diagnosis or treatment options for MS. However, if you're concerned about privacy, ask the doctor about his or her confidentiality rules — which include what data he or she can share and how long he or she can keep it for. It's also important to remember that you can always talk with other people who've been treated for MS, so you can learn more about each other's experiences as well."

This is an actual question from the forum that was solved by a student. The problem is that if you take the cube and do 3-dimensions of each face, then you will end up with 4 cubes instead of three (the original solution) so this could be very useful to solve other common problems such as 2x2x3 etc

Another example of a difficult problem is solving 5x5x4 or 4x4x4, but in order to get these numbers you need to have the top left corner of all 6 cubes on the bottom right and all 4 in the upper right

One way of doing this would be to find the two pieces which are at the same height, and put them next to each other to make 1 of each, and then repeat until there are 5 of one type, and 7 of another type. This is called ""bracketing"", and can be done using the following steps:

Find all 4 corners of both pieces next to each other, and put the 4th one on the right side

Then find the two pieces that are exactly the same size, place the one next to the other and create another of their kind

Repeat until there are 7 types, which is where we started

The only thing needed to finish this step is to find the exact distance between the first 4 corners. For this calculation, use the following equation:


If you add the four lengths of each piece, you should get the number of spaces between the middle two corners. If you add those 4 lengths together you should come up with the total length needed for any one corner. So your answer to the problem above should now read ""6.7"" which is the correct answer!

Question: How do you read the question? Answer: I just stare at it.

Question: What's your favorite book to study with? Answer: I don't like reading textbooks. I really think that there is no reason for me to waste my time on these things and they're not worth it at all! In terms of books, I would say ""The Little Prince"". It's a very interesting story about a boy who doesn't have any parents and he tries to make his own family by getting into different people's business. As a result, he ends up taking care of a cat as well. I've always loved this book because I love cats too. I've been fascinated by that idea ever since I was little.

I'd also say ""Invisible Cities"" and ""A Study of Spring"". Both of those are quite good stories too. They don't tell us what we should be doing but they give us an insight into how life can be better than the way we currently live it. They were written after WWII when Japan had invaded China. This made everyone afraid of China and so they tried to create a society without fear or hatred. But then some people started showing their true colors and the rest is history. So both of these stories show the consequences of hatred and fear.

Question: Do you remember where you learned to read? Answer: Yes. I used to go to school every day from 6am until 7pm. My teacher gave us homework. We had to learn the entire alphabet from A through Z. Then we had to write out a sentence based off our letter. So one morning I didn't get dressed properly and was late. She called me into her room and said: ""You're late."" I told her that I'm not really late, it was actually 4 am. She asked me what was wrong and why I was so late. I told her that my hair looked weird and that I only got there 3 minutes early. She told me I could wear long pants and heels if I wanted to. I decided against it because I felt like I might look stupid wearing my high-heeled shoes. It turned out to be an excellent decision.

96,Question: most efficient and sustainable diets\nAnswer:,"vegan

The best way to achieve this is to adopt a healthy lifestyle that reduces your impact on the environment. By eating less meat, dairy and eggs you will save money in groceries and fuel, cut down on waste, reduce greenhouse gases by reusing or recycling food and minimise your carbon footprint through travel and driving less.

It's also worth noting that people who eat more meat tend to live longer than those who don't – it may not be as much of a surprise that these people are healthier too!","eating low fat/low sugar diet.

A) Eating foods that are a source of saturated fatty acids, such as meats, butter, cheese, eggs, cream and other dairy products. Saturated fats have been shown to reduce cholesterol in the blood and this is very important for heart disease prevention. A high intake of saturated fats has also been found to increase LDL-C (bad cholesterol). The reason why it increases bad cholesterol is because of a chemical called docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which is mainly produced by algae and marine animals, but also found in some fish oils. It can be converted into another type of fat called eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which lowers serum triglycerides. This is known as DHA to EPA conversion ratio. One study showed that omega 3 fatty acids reduce total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol while increasing HDL-cholesterol; therefore they may help lower risk of heart disease. There is evidence that these fats inhibit formation of new cholesterol cells in the liver and prevent accumulation of lipid droplets in the arteries. Another study shows that people who consumed three or more servings per week had less plaque build up in their coronary arteries than those consuming no fatty acids. Therefore it seems likely that there could be benefits from the consumption of omega 3 fats. B) Consuming whole grains and vegetables. Whole grain foods like wheat bran, barley and oats are rich sources of fiber which improves digestion and reduces inflammation. These whole grain foods also provide vitamin C, magnesium, potassium and various phytochemicals like lignans (phytoestrogens), sesamin, folate, choline and phytic acid. They also contain selenium, manganese, zinc and iron. Nuts, seeds, avocado and olive oil, among others, are also good sources of healthy fats. C) Sticking to a Mediterranean diet. The Mediterranean Diet was developed based on a scientific review of the available data about diet and health. It consists of a variety of foods that consist of fresh fruits, vegetables and legumes, cooked with olive oil, lemon juice, garlic and spices, all in moderation. In particular, nonfat milk, yogurt, cheese and butter should be avoided. Foods such as white bread, white rice, pasta, pastas and potatoes have an added dietary fibre and thus help maintain bowel movements. Fruits including tomatoes, berries and citrus juices are also beneficial. Red meat has been shown to cause cancer in humans. While pork contains heterocyclic","the Paleolithic diet.

Q: what should I eat if you are on a low carb or ketogenic diet? Answer: eat more fruits and vegetables.

Paleo Diet Basics – What is Paleo Diet?

What is Paleo (or Primal) for You?

The Paleo diet is an ancient, ancestral diet that evolved out of our hunter-gatherer past where we were nomadic tribes living in small groups of family, friends, or neighbors who shared our food source with one another, as well as our hunting practices. The Paleo diet is based around eating real foods that came from nature, and avoiding processed junk foods like sugary cereals, soda, fast food, etc., which are not natural to us. It was created by Loren Cordain (author of ""Diet Revolution"" and ""The Paleo Solution"") and it provides health benefits for your body.

In his book ""Diet Revolution"", Dr. Cordain states that ""the Paleolithic diet is defined as a nutrient dense, plant-based diet that favors whole grains, fresh fruit, nuts, seeds, vegetables, legumes, dairy products and fish.""

This definition may seem pretty vague at first glance but take into account the fact that there has been no progress towards understanding why humans ate different things prior to the industrial revolution. Before the invention of agriculture, animals had not developed the ability to store fat and therefore did not have access to this important resource. Humans began farming after they became self sufficient and thus developed the ability to obtain their primary energy sources through animal meat instead of relying solely on plants. We then proceeded down the path of processing and refining these resources so that they could be easily consumed by human beings. Our ancestors lived in the same environment as those who lived before them, yet their dietary choices were far different and in many ways made sense.

To understand how to make good dietary choices today, we need to consider what our ancestors ate, as well as compare it to modern day nutrition standards that dictate what we can consume without causing harm. Here's a brief rundown of some key points about this amazing diet plan.

Benefits of The Paleo Diet

Health Benefits of the Paleo Diet:

Reduced risk of heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.

Increased bone density, strength, and flexibility.

Improved immune system function.

Greater overall mental focus.

Lower cholesterol levels.

Lowest blood sugar levels.

Myth #11. ""You have less chance of getting heart disease if you're vegetarian""

This is one I've heard a lot. This is not true at all. The American Heart Association recommends that people with heart disease should be eating more fat and cholesterol (especially saturated fats), while being much healthier on a plant-based diet. A study published in 2014 found that vegetarians had better health than omnivores and that they lived longer. In fact, the life expectancy of vegans was 25 years longer on average than meat eaters.

The reason for this difference? It's because animals are raised in such horrible conditions that it causes them chronic inflammation. Vegetarianism prevents these problems from occurring in humans. Also, studies show that when you eliminate grains, legumes, dairy and alcohol, your risk of dying from cancer goes down by 50 percent, strokes by 40 percent, diabetes by 30 percent and obesity by 20 percent. These factors can increase your chances of developing other diseases as well. This means more life!


In the end, our bodies depend heavily on carbohydrates, so we shouldn't be trying to live without them. Instead, we should try to maximize what we do have. And there are plenty of ways to do that—from eating enough vegetables and fruits to drinking lots of water.

A note about the US government: the National Institutes of Health has issued dietary guidelines stating that Americans should consume no more than 10% of their total calories from red meat and that no more than 50 grams of processed meats per week should count toward your weekly intake. But the guidelines don't go into detail about which foods are acceptable or even healthy for certain groups. So just follow whichever recommendations you find most convenient for you.

Myth #12. ""If you have no intention of ever giving up meat, you'll never make any progress.""

That may be true if you're still doing it just as part of your job, but here's what we know: Meat production is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than all forms of transportation combined—and that doesn't include the methane emitted during digestion and manure lagoons.

We know that reducing consumption of meat will help save our environment. We also know that some of us already take steps to reduce our carbon footprint; we don't need to give up entirely. We can still choose to eat less meat each day without losing too many of our","a vegetarian diet (sustainable in terms of food resources).

I asked the question above because I have heard that vegetarians are more likely to be overweight. However, what I found curious is that although this might seem like a very common assumption given what we hear about how much meat people eat, there actually is not enough evidence to support it. The best studies suggest no difference between the two groups (for example, here or here). Another study showed vegetarians had lower cholesterol than omnivores (see here), but again there was only weak evidence for these differences being due to the difference in dietary fat intake between vegetarians and omnivores. Another paper from Sweden suggested that the benefits of higher red-meat consumption were outweighed by increased risks of cardiovascular disease and cancer (here). While this is certainly interesting, my suspicion is that the effect is probably related to other factors rather than having anything to do with how much meat you eat. This includes the fact that those on low-fat diets tend to also eat more meat. And even if they did eat less, I don't think it would matter in terms of weight gain.

The bottom line

For me, the issue at hand is whether the high amount of meat consumed leads to an unhealthy diet, which is why I recommend following a vegetarian diet and not simply eating fewer processed foods. If your main goal is health then the answer seems clear – follow a vegetarian diet. But if your primary goal is weight loss, then it's important to understand that as long as the majority of your diet consists of vegetables and fruits, you should find that this won't lead to weight gain.

And here's another thing… in some cases a vegetarian diet can actually help prevent obesity. For example, one study in Finland showed that when children in a group switched from their traditional dinner of pork sausages and potato chips to a fish sandwich with bread and lettuce every night for three weeks, they lost twice as much weight as the control group did (1).

When we think about how our bodies digest food we must realize that there is a balance between the three nutrients. The most important nutrient for you as an adult is water. Without water your body cannot survive. Water is needed for brain function, digestion and elimination of waste products from cells such as uric acid, ammonia, glucose and carbon dioxide. All these functions are very important for keeping your organs healthy and functioning properly. It should be noted that some nutrients (such as sodium) are too concentrated to be absorbed through the normal mechanism by the small intestine. Therefore you need to eat a balanced diet. If you have a high blood pressure, you will probably want to reduce your sodium intake. As always it is wise to consult with a physician before making any changes in dietary habits. In order for your body to get rid of excess salt, especially sodium chloride, your kidneys have to process the salt in urine. Sodium citrate is used in many medications and other products. It works well in reducing urinary volume which improves kidney function. So if you do not like the taste of salty foods, try taking sodium citrate and see how it affects your bowel movements.


For people on low cholesterol levels, lowering their cholesterol level can also help lower their blood pressure. Although this type of therapy is only recommended after all other therapeutic efforts have failed and has not been proven effective by clinical trials. The only way to know if there is a connection between your LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and your blood pressure is to undergo a complete medical evaluation including a lipid panel. A simple blood test of the lipids, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and blood pressure is usually done at your doctor's office for $20-$30. It may take several months to receive results, but then you can go back to using salt sparingly until they come back."

Question: effects of vitamins A and D\nAnswer: Vitamins A and D appear to slow down memory loss. However, these nutrients","a combination of cardio exercise, resistance training and moderate aerobic training

2. Exercise duration – is it all about the reps?

Answer: yes and no

Aerobic exercises like running and cycling are good for increasing stamina in both short term and long term effects. Resistance training on the other hand has been proven to increase strength and power but only short-term (a few weeks). The best way to increase your endurance is by getting a daily session of aerobic exercise at least 3 times per week.

3. How much do you need to do?

Answer: depends on your goals

It is important to get your body into an optimal condition before undertaking any new fitness program. This means that you should start with a routine that includes some type of cardiovascular activity so that you will have enough energy to go through the whole plan. That said if you are going to embark on this journey then consider working out three days a week (5-6 sets) while eating nutritious meals every 2 hours or more than 6 hrs each day.

4. Is there a ""one size fits all"" workout?

Answer: not necessarily. Some people might benefit from doing a little bit more cardio work than others while others may be better suited for higher intensity exercises such as weight lifting or circuit training. You will know which type of workout works best for you based on the exercises you use and the intensity you achieve in each one.

If you are feeling tired after just 5 minutes of cardio work then try to break up your workout with longer bouts of high intensity exercise. For example, try running for 20 minutes followed by walking for 30 minutes or cycling for 15 minutes followed by jogging for 10 minutes. It could take anywhere from 2-10 sessions to reach full recovery. But keep in mind that you can't expect to walk around half your normal speed during these workouts.

5. What if I want to run/bike/swim/etc.?

Answer: that's awesome! There are many ways to exercise when you don't want to push yourself too hard. If you want to jump on the bike or swim you would probably enjoy the workout much more than someone who wants to run the entire marathon in under 4 hours.

As far as how long each workout lasts depends largely on the individual but it's generally between 1 hour and 2 hours. However, even if you are planning on exercising every single day you still won't be able to last 16.7 km. So what","the effects are dose related.

Q17. What is your age? How old were you when you started exercising regularly?

A: I was born in 1981 and have been running since 1988 (before that I ran on a regular basis). The first time I saw pictures of a cross-country race, I asked my parents if they could take me to the marathon, so I went with them. It has always amazed me how young athletes can run so well, especially at this level (the marathon is not very competitive, but it requires more endurance than most other events). My current age is 33 years (I am also an active member of the U.S. Air Force Reserves, where we do lots of aerobics and strength training, including a lot of hill sprints)

Q18. Do you consider yourself a health nut or a fitness freak?

A: Not sure what fitness means exactly. But I guess if I had to choose between being fit and healthy, I'd probably say ""both"" because I'm able to maintain a normal weight while maintaining my cardiovascular system.

Q19. Are there any exercises/techniques you would like to try in the future that you're currently unable to do due to injury?

A: Running in place for 30 minutes straight (and then walking around until I get tired). The last two times I did this, I broke a rib and cut off some tendons on one of my legs. However, both times I was already limping from the previous day's workouts, and the third time I didn't really want to do it anyway. I never tried this in a race prior to this year. So far, I've only done this once this season.

Q20. Have you ever taken classes at a college or university? If so, which degree(s)? And why did you decide to pursue such an advanced degree in sport science (or any field)?

A: Yes, I took a few classes through my undergrad years at Rutgers University, then again through grad school at Arizona State University. In addition to sports medicine, I took several courses in biology, physiology, psychology, sociology, and economics. None of these subjects really appealed to me and I ended up dropping all of them after graduation.

Q21. Describe some of the most amazing experiences you've had during your running career; either at a track meet, in a race, etc.?

A: One time, I got into","It can help to prevent and treat a variety of illnesses \n\

How many calories do I burn doing active tasks? Answer: The number varies from person to person. You may not be able to keep track as well as you should or count calories for the full day, but it's best to find out how much activity you need each day. One rule of thumb is that if you walk more than 1 mile (1.6 km) per hour, your body will use about 0.5 to 2 calories per minute. This is based on the average daily mileage of an adult walking 5 miles (8 km). If you exercise outside more often in colder weather, you might get away with burning fewer calories per minute. Your goal is to burn at least 150 calories per hour. For example, if you start every morning by getting up at 6:30 am and continuing to walk until lunchtime, then you'd burn 150 calories in 30 minutes, which would take an additional 40 minutes total to reach the goal. In other words, you have to increase your pace over time to meet the goal.


What are the health risks associated with excess sedentary behavior? Answer: Too little physical activity is linked to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, sleep apnea, depression, obesity, high blood pressure, cancer, arthritis, and some types of cancer. Excess sedentary behavior leads to several other serious diseases including hypertension, heart attack, stroke, arthritis, obesity, impaired immune function, osteoarthritis, and Type 2 diabetes. Sedentary behaviors also affect people who aren't physically active. People who sit too much are twice as likely to die prematurely from any cause as those who stand or move less during their leisure time. They're also four times more likely to develop certain cancers. The good news is that even though you don't want to ""lose weight,"" being sedentary isn't necessarily unhealthy. By simply moving more when you feel tired, you'll reduce the risk of premature death and improve overall quality of life.


Why do Americans spend so much time sitting? Answer: When we sit down, our brains release dopamine into our reward circuits. Dopamine is a chemical messenger in our brain that helps us feel pleasure and excitement. Sitting all day, however, disrupts this natural process, turning dopamine back on and making us feel bored or frustrated. This makes us crave something else to fill our idle hours – coffee, TV, computer games, and so forth.


Is there a","it helps you to reduce your risk of a number of chronic diseases.

Q25-26: Is it possible for me to get cancer from exercising too much?

A25-26: The risks are extremely low if done properly, however there is no way of knowing how many people in the history of mankind have got cancer because of over-exercise (especially since some cancers are not caused by exercise at all) and therefore the chances are very small but they can happen.

In addition to this, exercising does increase the levels of hormones that are known to cause breast cancer as well as other forms of cancer.

It should also be noted that the amount of calcium needed will decrease with exercise, so you may need more food than usual. This means you'll probably eat less before or after exercise. If this happens, then you must continue to eat normally afterwards. For example, milk can be consumed while exercising, although if you do not drink any milk whilst exercising, it's best to wait until the next day when you've recovered and started drinking again.

Q. What does the word ""exercise"" mean? A. Exercise is a physical activity that has been proven to improve health and fitness levels, and can be performed at any age or stage of life. Exercising may be done by yourself, with friends and family, in the comfort of your own home or elsewhere. It may also include activities such as yoga and Pilates classes. Physical exercise improves cardiovascular (blood vessel) function; increases muscular strength and endurance; lowers blood pressure; reduces stress and anxiety; and boosts brain power.


How much physical activity do I need to get the most benefit from my exercise program? A. If you're healthy and exercising regularly, the best way to achieve good health is to increase your daily physical activity level. To maintain your weight loss success while trying to lose fat, it's important to ensure that your daily physical activity level is maintained throughout the whole process. An easy way to keep track of your daily activity and progress is through our Fitbit Activity Tracker. This tracker monitors your steps taken each day, and gives you an estimate of how many more calories you'll burn if you spend one hour on each step than if you walk for the same time. Using a Fitbit Activity Tracker will help you make informed decisions about what kind of activity to undertake when you want to reach new goals and see them become achievable. The Fitbit app for iPhone® helps you set and monitor your daily exercise goal on your phone so you don't have to carry around a separate device and remember to update it every morning. It also provides reminders of the next steps toward reaching your target amount of daily exercise. You can use your Fitbit devices as a daily reminder and reminder system, too. For example, you could use the Fitbit Alta™ wristband as a countdown timer for walking your dog or another activity of choice. The Fitbit Charge HR wristband also lets you know when you should take a break from your workouts because you've run out of energy.


Do I really need to eat every 2 hours to meet my physical activity requirement? A. No. Your body needs regular bursts of food intake and breaks during your exercise routines to replenish needed nutrients and repair damaged muscle tissue. Eating plenty of nutritious foods before and after you workout will help keep you energized as you go along - especially if you like to snack! However, just eating enough food won't give you the extra energy boost you need to stay active long term. That's why we","exercise, strength training and mental healthBenefits of physical activity

In general, physical activity is beneficial for everyone, with moderate or vigorous intensity at least two to three times a week being the most effective. However, there are many individual differences in how much physical activity is ideal, so the best way to determine your level of fitness and need for regular physical activity is to do some research.

""The more physically active I am, the better I feel.""- Mary Jane Mottram


Mary Jane Mottram explains that the main reason people get fat is not because they're inactive, but because they eat too little; if they were just as fit as they think they are, their food intake would be higher and they'd have less body weight to gain. Therefore, the key is to build up their stamina and endurance to handle any situation they may encounter, such as driving to work or getting stuck on the side of the road.


Practical tips for building stamina and endurance while exercising\nSome things to consider before starting an exercise program

You don't always need to go to the gym, though. Here are some tips from personal trainers, athletes and doctors on what to try first.


When you start training, you should aim for something around 2 hours. It's difficult to achieve this without feeling tired or worse after an hour or so, so make sure you've tried everything else you could think of first. There isn't really one ""best"" workout, although exercises which require more speed than strength will benefit you more (such as sprinting, rowing or swimming).


It's also important to take breaks when you feel like you're running out of steam. Take a walk if possible - it'll help boost your heart rate and burn calories; it also gives your muscles a break! If your legs are burning too quickly, however, just stand up and stretch.


Physical activities are good for you: the good news is that you can use them to improve other areas of your life such as self esteem, confidence, concentration and even your sex drive!

98,Question: most common complications in pregnancy\nAnswer:,"most common complication is gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

A. GDM and gestational diabetes mellitus can lead to serious problems for the woman, including high blood pressure, hypertension, heart disease and stroke.

B. The risk of a miscarriage increases with increased severity of preeclampsia or antepartum as well as postpartum gestational diabetes mellitus.

C. Some women who have preeclampsia may need an emergency cesarean section during the early part of their pregnancy if they have already given birth once before. If you are pregnant and have had a prior delivery, it is important to be monitored closely for signs of pre-eclamptic jaundice. Your health care provider will determine if this condition needs immediate attention.

D. The risks associated with a previous caesarean section increase greatly after 34 weeks' gestation (approximately 24 months). This is because the baby's head has grown significantly larger. Even if there were no other significant risk factors, a previous vaginal delivery could interfere with blood flow through your uterus and cause uterine rupture.","not sure

Q. What is the best time to have a home pregnancy test?A. You can use it as early as possible after you've been pregnant and before you go into labour or if you are very far along in your pregnancy, so that your body has plenty of time to absorb it (within 1-3 hours). If you take your first test when you're still in your period – within 2 weeks postpartum – then it won't give accurate results until more than three months later (after 7-10 days postpartum) or 3 months afterwards (more than 10 days postpartum), unless you are on an oral contraceptive (such as Yasmin®). You should avoid taking a home pregnancy test at night, even if the light is off (if you're on any type of medication or don't want to be bothered by the blood). The last thing you need is an inaccurate reading!You might also consider testing more frequently, especially if you're worried about spotting or am expecting twins – because this will help you spot problems earlier, which may mean less anxiety for both you and your partner.Q. Why do I sometimes get false positive tests at my doctor's surgery?A. Many women who've been through IVF/ICSI can recognise these signs – they could possibly be due to things like a small tear in the membrane between your vagina and cervix causing a leaky pregnancy test, faulty batteries, or too many tests performed in the first 24-48 hours of your menstrual cycle. Some doctors simply forget to perform them properly, others change their mind once the treatment has started. You should contact your midwife directly for advice on what may cause these issues.Q. How often do my home pregnancy tests need to be re-tested?A.

Q&A: what is the risk for miscarriage from using a BPA free baby bottle? Answer: The risk of a spontaneous abortion or miscarriage due to an exposure to BPA in a mother's breast milk after a single use of one bottle during her pregnancy varies with the age and reproductive status of the woman. Women who are pregnant can have abortions without fear of harming their baby, while women under 20 may not be able to get pregnant if exposed to the chemicals. After the first trimester, pregnancy and breastfeeding will protect you from possible health effects by decreasing your chances of developing problems later in life.

Q: what is the name of your hospital?


A: University Medical Center, Baltimore, Maryland


What kind of care do you receive at the hospital?

Prenatal care (including birth and postnatal) is delivered by qualified physicians who provide comprehensive prenatal care including prenatal vitamins to women from 9 am-3 pm Monday through Saturday and 6 pm-7 pm on Sunday for the first trimester. A midwife or physician assistant may also be present during these hours to assist with delivery. If an emergency arises, a physician will administer emergency obstetrical resuscitation until medical assistance arrives. During labor and delivery, a skilled nurse provides maternal physical support and monitoring, while a registered nurse administers medications and supplies necessary to maintain the health of both mother and baby. The intensive care unit (ICU), a ward within our hospital that contains the latest technology, treats severe conditions that require advanced medical attention to ensure healthy survival of both mother and infant. In addition, there is a neonatologist available 24 hours a day to evaluate babies born prematurely.


How many births per week can you accommodate?


All hospitals have limited space, so we ask prospective mothers if they would like to reserve one of our beds. We generally accommodate 30 births a month!


Is there an additional charge for having a cesarean section?


No extra charges are added when an expectant mother chooses this option, but it does take longer than if she had a vaginal delivery. Our staff is here to help all patients during their labor and afterbirth.","If you have a spontaneous abortion, it is more likely to be ectopic (tube) or hemorrhagic (blood clotting). If the miscarriage was caused by an abnormal sperm or egg and no other cause could be found, your baby will probably survive. But if there are genetic problems that can affect the fetus, such as Down syndrome, then this may mean that your baby's survival might not be guaranteed.

What are some signs of early pregnancy loss?

Sometimes there are no obvious symptoms at all. This happens often when women who haven't been pregnant for several years get pregnant during their monthly periods. In these cases, the cervix usually swells and closes up before the woman knows she is pregnant. However, sometimes an ultrasound scan shows something called uterine perforation - the opening into your uterus has become blocked with tissue from your fallopian tubes. Or there is cramping, which is like childbirth but painful. Other times a doctor may take a sample of amniotic fluid from your vagina (amniotomy), which gives them information about how far along you were in your pregnancy. This test also shows whether you had any prenatal tests to check for possible problems.


If you think you may be having a miscarriage or stillbirth, see your GP or midwife immediately. They'll do everything they can to help find out what's going on, including taking a blood sample and doing an ultrasound scan. This isn't always done if you're just getting back home after being abroad, because the risk is higher.

The term was coined by Drs. H.G. Brown and J.L. Williams after a patient with pelvic organ prolapse who had been treated for bladder cancer complained that her symptoms were similar to those of an ectopic pregnancy. In this type of POC, the uterus moves into a more normal position within the pelvis and can become stuck or displaced.


If you notice any signs of pelvic organ prolapse you should see your gynecologist as soon as possible to avoid serious damage.


A prolapsed uterus may cause cramping, pain in the lower abdomen, abdominal distention, or swelling in the vagina. Symptoms include severe pain in the lower back or lower abdomen, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, tenderness/swelling of one side of the abdomen, heavy vaginal bleeding, and urinary urgency.


In cases where there are no other causes for pelvic organ prolapse the following test may be helpful in diagnosis of POC: ""can a fistula exist between the urethra and the external genitalia?""


""can a perforation occur within the cervix?""


(if so - please call us at 800-452-4453 immediately!)


and


""can a large uterine blood vessel be seen protruding from the vulva?""


Your doctor may recommend further testing and treatment if these tests are positive. If not, then the only option available to treat PO is surgery: surgical removal of the ovary, fallopian tube, and uterus. These procedures will be performed under general anesthesia and usually require two or three days recovery time. After surgery, follow up visits will allow for monitoring of your progress. Once again, consult your primary care physician before making any significant changes in your medication regimen.


Another complication that can occur during treatment of PO is a peritonitis. This condition occurs when bacteria enter the uterus causing an infection (usually bacterial vaginosis) which causes inflammation or pain during intercourse, menstruation, or childbirth. A good rule of thumb is to check with your doctor every 6 months whether or not your PO has returned.

Prenatal care

Q. What is prenatal care?

A. Prenatal care refers to the medical care offered during a woman's pregnancy at her first antenatal visit, before she knows whether she is pregnant or not. This may include things like check-ups and tests that are important for your baby's health. The following types of services are offered to women who have just been diagnosed with gestational diabetes: blood test for glucose (blood sugar) level, ultrasound, and amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. These medical appointments can be arranged by your physician's office.


In addition, you will receive a list of prenatal vitamins and supplements along with advice on what you need during and after your pregnancy. In order to avoid being left without necessary medications due to the fact that some medication do not come in the form you need, it is recommended that you consult with your doctor about the type of medication and dosage that should be taken for your specific case.


Q. When do I start my prenatal care?

A. It depends upon how far along into the pregnancy you are. Some women go into labor within 3 weeks. Others take longer. You'll want to talk with your healthcare provider about your personal situation so you know which day you're going to give birth.


If you are planning on having a homebirth, discuss this with your provider beforehand so they can help you decide when and where you would want to deliver. Be sure to bring plenty of clothing, snacks and toys if there will be any change diapers (if needed), and provide extra towels, bottles, pacifiers, formula and breast milk to nurse on while you wait for your delivery date.


For many women, their initial visit to the doctor is the easiest part of their pregnancy. If there are no major concerns, then it's time to move onto the next stage of care. Your provider may ask you questions such as:

• How many people will be accompanying me for my appointment?

• How soon will we schedule our second appointment?

• Will I see my OB/GYN again after this visit?

• Are there any particular foods I should avoid during my pregnancy?

• Do I have any pre-existing conditions?

• Will I have","How can I tell whether my cervix is dilated or not?

Cervical dilation and effacement (D&E) is a very normal part of the course of pregnancy. It occurs when your body learns to work better with what it's been given by the placenta, increasing blood flow around the cervix, which helps reduce pain. D&E often leads to bleeding and infection, so you need to be careful about handling things that are inserted into the vagina during labor because they might cause problems.

Can I have cervical dilation if I am pregnant?


Yes, but the chances of having symptoms related to dilation after the birth is high. Most women will start experiencing vaginal bleeding within 5-7 days after delivery, sometimes much sooner.

Pregnancy is more likely to lead to painful intercourse during this time than at any other point in their lives. If you're concerned that this may be happening for you, talk to your doctor. It could be due to a problem with your cervix. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that you wait 24 hours before using tampons. They also suggest wearing sanitary pads as soon as possible once you feel full-term.

The most common complication from cervical dilation is expulsion of an object. This is usually caused by a finger or pencil passed too close to the opening of the cervix. To make sure no objects get inside of you, use only clean cotton or absorbent underwear whenever you touch your labia during sex. Tampons should stay out while you're sitting down on your toilet. You shouldn't use anything else until you've finished urinating.

What do I do if I want to take precautions to prevent dilation?

In some cases, it's important to keep your cervix open longer than usual to avoid complications such as an abscess or a tear. However, other women don't even notice when they have a long cervix. Since it doesn't affect you, you should feel free to go ahead and let yourself become pregnant without worrying about dilating your uterus.

You may experience discomfort during or immediately after giving birth, especially if you've had a caesarean section. These feelings often fade fairly quickly and there aren't many ways to treat them. Try taking ibuprofen or acetaminophen if they give you headache or nausea.

There are a variety of conditions that can cause this complication. If you have been pregnant for more than 5 years or are prone to pre-eclampsia, the risk is higher. The condition is known as gestational hypertension. This occurs when your blood pressure rises during pregnancy. As a result, your placenta grows too tightly and can tear. It is usually not serious, but it may interfere with a baby's ability to get enough oxygen. Also, if there are many red blood cells floating around in your urine, your baby will be exposed to increased amounts of iron, which could increase anemia. A ruptured uterus can also occur when a woman has a miscarriage or gets an ectopic pregnancy (when a fertilized egg implants outside the womb). An ectopic pregnancy might grow into a fallopian tube and block off the passage between the ovaries and uterus. If left untreated, the pregnancy could end in abortion or stillbirth (death after delivery from lack of oxygen). Another complication that can happen during pregnancy includes high blood sugar levels. High blood sugar means your liver isn't able to produce much insulin and sugar, so your body needs extra glucose to burn calories. Without adequate nutrients, your blood sugar can rapidly rise and cause your baby to develop hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).

Diagnosis and treatment:

Your doctor can diagnose pre-eclampsia by conducting a physical exam. Your doctor will ask about symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, and shortness of breath. They'll also look at your height, weight, family history, medications, and any other factors that might raise a concern. Blood tests, ultrasound scans, and fetal ultrasounds will help identify the problem and make sure there aren't any underlying health issues. In severe cases, you might need to undergo surgery. A blood test called a beta-HCG test helps confirm the diagnosis. Beta-HCG stands for betaglucose-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and its purpose is to analyze a type of protein produced in your pancreas. Since pregnancy causes your pancreas to produce a lot of this enzyme, an abnormal reading indicates pre-eclampsia. You're given a shot of beta-HCG along with medication to lower your blood sugar. Depending on what stage of labor you go through, your doctor may recommend further testing, like ultrasound examinations, to determine how soon you should deliver"
101,Question: heavy flares swelling lymph nodes\nAnswer:,"light-colored flare will do this.

Fluid retention (also known as water retention) is the most common symptom of a thyroid disorder. Many patients experience fluid retention from hypothyroidism, while others have developed it after the onset of symptoms. Patients may not notice their fluid retention until they start experiencing symptoms. Most people who develop fluid retention are younger than 40 years old; however, some elderly women also report fluid retention. [5] In most cases, fluid retention does not require medical treatment. However, fluid retention can be associated with certain complications and conditions. For example, when someone experiences fluid retention due to a poor diet or other factors that decrease the amount of dietary salt in their body, their kidneys can become irritated, which leads to further fluid retention. This condition can cause dehydration, so if you suspect your fluid retention is related to an underlying health problem, such as kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, your doctor might recommend testing for these diseases first. Other causes of fluid retention include severe dehydration (including fasting), high levels of physical stress, vomiting, or diarrhea. Some medications may also worsen fluid retention. Symptoms of fluid retention that don't involve fluids usually begin within 2 weeks of stopping thyroid hormone replacement therapy. The typical duration of fluid retention after stopping hormonal therapy is 6 months. It's important to note, though, that symptoms of fluid retention may continue indefinitely even if you stop taking the medication; in fact, some patients feel better once they've stopped taking their thyroid medication. If symptoms persist, talk to your doctor about whether there are any treatments available that can help resolve the issue.","not sure. What are the results of this type of surgery?

A: It's an experimental procedure that has been studied in a few small studies. The outcome hasn't yet been proven, but is thought to be better than radiation therapy for some types of lymph node cancer.

Some people have had success with it, and some haven't. The risk factors aren't well known, so you should talk to your oncologist about them if you're considering trying it. You'll probably need follow-up care after the operation (see above).","you should stop using it.

The side effects of the medicine are very minor. The most common side effect is constipation, which can be reduced by drinking more fluids. There's also the possibility that a person could develop other side effects after stopping the medication. If you notice any changes in your symptoms or side effects, contact your doctor. You will need to see a specialist for this.

Treatment

Your doctor may prescribe another type of anti-viral medication called a ritonavir (also known as famciclovir). It doesn't have the same long term side effects and is much less likely to cause serious side effects. This is because ritonavir works to kill viruses (viruses don't last long when they're active) rather than changing how cells work. Ritonavir reduces levels of virus in the blood so that there is no longer a virus left at a time when people should be infected with viruses.

In some cases, your doctor might recommend a single dose of ritonavir if you haven't been taking it for 7 days. In other cases, you might need 3 doses of ritonavir over 4 weeks.

What other medicines are available?

If you've already started treatment with an antiviral drug and still experience symptoms such as tiredness, fever or joint pain, ask your doctor about alternative treatments before discontinuing treatment.","the sun is the most effective way to reduce pain from swollen lymph nodes. The use of the sun during pregnancy is a great help in reducing swelling in swollen lymph nodes caused by PMDD and fibromyalgia syndrome.

Q11: I have been having intense headaches for about a year, not sleeping well or even feeling like myself. It feels as if my head is exploding! What can be done?

A: There are many things that can happen with migraine headaches. Most often you will feel your head hurts, but it doesn't always hurt; sometimes they don't bother you at all.

You may also notice changes in your vision, numbness, tingling, light sensitivity, difficulty concentrating (even when trying to do something), problems focusing on what you're doing, etc. You can get treatment for these symptoms too. In addition, you should talk to your doctor. They might suggest that you try other medications, such as anti-seizure drugs, so that you can avoid medication side effects. Some people have experienced improvement after taking Tylenol, but this isn't guaranteed.

Q12: My wife and I have two children under 5 years old. We've decided to stop using birth control because we didn't want to risk getting pregnant again and would rather focus our energy on them. How do I tell her how much better my health has gotten since we've stopped using birth control?

A: If you still want to continue taking birth control and you can afford it, there's no need to hide from your wife. She'll know exactly how much better you are than she did before you stopped. Keep asking yourself questions, especially ""Why am I being so tired?"" as soon as you wake up in the morning and ""How bad was my night last night?"" as you drift off to sleep.

In fact, let her know how good she looks. Tell her how beautiful you look when you eat well and exercise regularly. Let her know how much more rested you feel and how much better your moods are now.

Tell her everything you see when you see her. Be honest with her because you never know how important some information may be. She probably won't understand how good you feel until she sees it herself. When you have time together, tell each other anything else that comes into your mind, including any concerns about your body or feelings about food or lifestyle choices.

Answer: The patient should be admitted to an intensive care unit.


B:

Q: The patient has had several episodes of fevers with loss of consciousness and tachycardia, often accompanied by nausea. She has developed some of the same symptoms that are common with viral encephalitis. A possible diagnosis would be acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM).


C:

Q: Is this severe disease really caused by smallpox?

Answer: No. There have been no reported cases of smallpox or any related illnesses in this region for at least 500 years. This is not true because many indigenous populations still have smallpox vaccine which may be useful in eradicating wild populations of smallpox.


D:

Q: How can we keep our children from catching this horrible disease?

Answer: The following measures can be taken:


a) Protect them against exposure: If you think your child might come into contact with a case of measles, you must immediately take him/her to see a doctor and inform him/her of his/her condition so he/she can be treated immediately.

b) Maintain proper hygiene by using proper personal protection like gloves or masks when cleaning up after handling diseased animals.

c) Do not let anyone else handle your child without first washing their hands before doing so.


e) Provide strict supervision to all medical personnel who work with sick patients as well as in the community where the patient lives. Any person displaying any signs or symptoms of smallpox, especially fever, rash, painful sores on nose, mouth or lips or cough should immediately report it to someone responsible for keeping the public health under control.","they are. There is a lot of evidence from animal studies that heavy flares cause damage to the lymph node lining and may be associated with development of cancer.

Q: what's the best way to reduce the risk of developing a blood clot (thrombosis)? Answer: The key factor is maintaining good cardiovascular health as well as avoiding tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and high-risk occupations such as driving or operating hazardous machinery. The latter two can increase your chance of having a blood clot by causing you to release more blood clots when you have an abnormal reaction to something in your body (for example: a heart attack).

A blood clot occurs when a piece of blood cells breaks off, travels down the blood vessels towards the lungs where it blocks the flow of blood (clot) between them. It then stops working, usually within three days. When the blood clot breaks free, it collects in one part of the lung (pleura), at which point it becomes 'clotted' with another type of fluid called plasma (plasma being the red liquid inside your blood). Clotting is only possible if there is some sort of interaction between the particles in the clot.

Some types of surgery and even certain medications can trigger blood clots to form and stop functioning properly. You should not become ill from a blood clot - if you do get it, seek medical advice immediately. Most people who experience clots will recover without treatment in a few weeks. However, if a large clot has broken loose inside your leg and is blocking a vein in your arm, the situation might prove more serious so it is important for you to ask your doctor how long you need to rest before trying again.","No, I am a healthy person.

Question: swollen lymph node(s) and swollen veins

Answer: yes, especially if you're taking corticosteroids

Question: swollen lymph node(s) but no swelling of the vein is it possible to drain a lymphedema cyst? Answer: yes, without surgery it's possible (especially if you have arthritis). You should see your doctor. Lymphedema is an inflammation of the tissues that surround your organs. It can be caused by conditions such as diabetes or certain medications. Your doctor will check for any underlying causes of lymphedema. You may need medical treatment if you already have one. The most common causes include: Aortic valve disease – This condition affects the valves that control blood flow in the arteries which supply the heart and brain. Other symptoms include low blood pressure (hypotension), chest pain, and shortness of breath (pulmonary edema).

– This condition affects the valves that control blood flow in the arteries which supply the heart and brain. Other symptoms include low blood pressure (hypotension), chest pain, and shortness of breath (pulmonary edema). Diabetes – Diabetes leads to high levels of sugar in your bloodstream and excess insulin production, both of which can cause enlargement of body fluids. As the pancreas becomes less sensitive to signals from the stomach and intestines, the amount of sugars stored in the liver increases. As this happens, fat cells are added to the fatty deposits on the inside of your walls, making them more prominent. This process causes abnormal fluid retention and can also increase the risk of developing other diseases related to liver function such as cirrhosis. This can happen with people who are not overweight. However, there is evidence that fatty deposits associated with diabetes are common among obese individuals (see pictures above).

5.2. The body has a tendency to absorb water from the air in times of extreme stress or extreme cold or heat. This is called evaporation. When this happens, the water leaves your cells through pores that are not normally open. These pores are located between each cell's membrane and its nucleus (the center of the cell). It can take up to two weeks for water molecules to pass through these pore spaces into your bloodstream, so if you have been in an environment where the weather was hot or cold, it can be very hard to breathe because all of the water evaporated before it could get out.

Because there are certain substances that make us more sensitive to changes in our environment, we need constant rest and exercise. We also need to drink water at least twice daily in order to keep ourselves hydrated and maintain proper blood sugar levels and electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and calcium. If we go without water, the kidneys will start to conserve it by drawing on stored water from other parts of the body. This allows the body to avoid losing water too quickly. But over time, the kidneys lose enough water to eventually cause dehydration (low blood volume) unless you are drinking plenty of fluids.

The body needs a lot of salt during times when you're exercising and your body isn't getting enough rest. Because the kidneys regulate how much salt we consume, people with diabetes who do not drink enough fluid may develop kidney stones, which can lead to serious health problems. Many athletes use sports drinks containing electrolytes to help control their thirst. However, many sports drinks contain artificial sweeteners, which raise the level of insulin in the body, making the person feel hungry. This can interfere with weight loss efforts. You should choose foods that give you energy, but don't increase hunger.

In addition to the above issues involving water, sweating is another common problem among people with type 2 diabetes. Sweating occurs when the skin produces excess amounts of perspiration, especially when you sweat profusely after vigorous activity. In some cases, these excessive feelings of thirst may last for hours. Sometimes, the pain associated with excessive sweating may actually make you thirsty. And sometimes, these symptoms of thirst may be due to a normal response of the nervous system. For example, the brain thinks that you need water or other liquids to prevent dehydration, even though you aren't thirsty. As a result, your body releases the hormone norepinephrine, causing you"

Answer: its called salicylic acid which is an ingredient in other products so if you have a problem with acne before trying this product then go back to using the acne meds as it will affect your skin. i did not have any reaction when i used this but i can see why others would.

Question: do i need to rinse it off after use? or does it last forever? Answer: yes you should rinse it off because there are some ingredients in it that may irritate your skin. you can also wait 2 weeks until your skin gets used to the ingredients that are in it.

Question: how often do i need to reapply? Answer: every 3 days or so to reduce chances of drying out.

Question: I'm on prescription retinoids. Do these work for me? Answer: retinoids (tretinoin) have to be applied twice daily at night and once daily during the day. this means that they only work a couple times each month but that it is very effective.

Question: Does my skin change color because of this product? Answer: probably not, unless you put a lot of sunscreen or sunblock on your face.

Question: What is the ingredient list? or what kind of ingredients are included? Answer: the ingredients include all natural plant extracts and botanical extracts, along with vitamin A, B3, B5, C, E and K. The cream has about 15% alpha hydroxy acids, which makes up about 75% of the total formula.

Q3 – I suffer from eczema. How long does it last? A – Eczema will always run its course. It lasts for about 6 months or longer in most cases. But this varies between people depending on how sensitive they are to certain triggers. Sometimes it flares up and doesn't go away entirely.

Question: my daughter has eczema, I want her to see if she can help me. Should I give her some creams? Answer – If she's used them safely, no, it won't hurt her. In fact, it might even be beneficial. She may stimulate the immune system because she is ""in tune"" with the environment. This may mean she gets more antibodies against bacteria and other allergens. Her skin will still feel dry/itching when she goes swimming or sweating and it may be red and swollen at times (sometimes called bullous eruption) but it won't itch like an allergic rash would. Also, because she's been using these creams properly, it won't hurt her too much after she stops. In addition to her usual treatments, here are some things you could try: 1. Take her on a daily probiotic supplement (like Echinacea). Probiotics contain both good Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains. They are very good in helping to heal acne, especially inflammatory acne. 2. Try a vitamin C cream (such as Retin-A or Vitamin A). 3. Use tea tree oil on the affected areas once or twice per week. 4. Take antihistamines such as Albuterol or Benadryl. 5. Consider giving her a prescription topical steroid product (such as Neutrogena Ultra Power Ultra Moisturizer). 6. Ask a dermatologist what she recommends for treating eczema. 7. Give her a lot of gentle, non-drying moisturizers. 8. Limit exposure to sunlight during the summer months. 9. Don't apply any oils onto the affected areas. 10. Avoid hot tubbing, swimming, etc. 11. If possible avoid sunbat","Yes

A: I've been living with it for over 10 years.

Q: What are your symptoms?

A: Dry, cracked skin (almost always red) which gets extremely dry, cracking and peeling off the skin from my hands, feet, neck and back, sometimes my face as well. The skin on the palms of my hand is usually particularly dry. There also seems to be a thickening of the skin around the area where it cracks and peels off. It can sometimes feel tight in places like my elbows or wrists but not so much that it would be painful if it was pulled. Also often, it feels heavy on my chest and shoulders. Occasionally, I get rash around the site where the skin breaks away. Occasionally I break out like crazy. My hair is also frequently thinning due to my acne and sometimes when the skin rashes. Sometimes my face and neck hurt too. But my facial wrinkles don't seem to go away because they're constantly breaking up again. I have very dark circles under my eyes. If you look closely at me, you'll notice that my skin has small bumps all over it. They're not pimples though - they're just little white dots. And sometimes they come in clumps so thickly they become pretty obvious.

There's no cure for my skin problems!

I'm working hard now trying to reduce the amount of stress/stress hormones that cause them, and hopefully get past them. Unfortunately, it takes some time, and I am still getting them occasionally. As soon as I do get rid of them completely, then I will probably start using skincare products that work better for me because they aren't linked to hormonal issues. In the meantime, I keep applying a lot of moisturizer and anti-aging serums, as well as anti-bacterial creams like Neutrogena Gentle Blackhead Power Liquid, for a few days after a major flare-up.

Q: what is the best method of getting rid of psoriasis?A: a combination of both psoralen and antibiotics. Psoralens are effective at reducing inflammation, while the antibiotic helps to kill bacteria that causes psoriasis. You should try both methods in order to see which works best for you.

Q: why does my skin become oily after using psoralens?A: this is caused when your body uses up the natural oils on your face, which makes them less available for the active ingredients of psoralens. The oil will build up again as soon as you start taking a new dose of psoralen or any other topical psoriasis treatment. This happens because psoralens have a unique structure, so they quickly reach their peak effectiveness before eventually going down. This can cause your skin to look greasy and flaky once more as soon as you stop using psoralens. To avoid this, use a moisturizer every day to help prevent skin breakdown and excess oil production. If oily skin persists, contact your doctor.

Question: achy back/neck\nAnswer: nagging pains in the back and neck, sometimes on movement.

Question: aching or tight muscles\nAnswer: muscles often become tight when overworked. This may be due to muscle strains from prolonged exercise; these strains are usually self-limiting after some time. It is helpful to stretch them regularly. There is no medical reason for this condition.

Question: acne\nAnswer: skin pimples can occur as a result of hormonal changes. They are caused by excess oil produced during pregnancy. If you have not had your period (or if you are a postpartum woman), these symptoms will disappear with time. However, if you continue to experience them, see your doctor.

Question: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\nAnswer: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most common behavioral disorder affecting children and adolescents. Symptoms include difficulty paying attention and difficulty controlling impulses. ADHD is treatable and is often treated through therapy and medication. Unfortunately, many people do not seek treatment until their teen years, at which point they may not understand that the problems they face are normal adolescent responses to life experiences.

Question: Atopic dermatitis\nAnswer: Acne is an allergic reaction caused by bacteria called Propionibacterium acnes. An adult with a history of atopic disease develops atopy without knowing it. A person who has been exposed to atopy develops skin lesions that resemble those seen in someone with atopic dermatitis. These lesions might itch but generally heal within two weeks. People who develop eczema should avoid sun exposure while having a flare up of their eczema.

Question: Autism\nAnswer: Autism spectrum disorders, also known as autism, refers to a range of mental retardation, developmental delay, or other difficulties that affect communication skills, social interaction, and repetitive behaviors, among other things. Symptoms of autism can vary widely depending on the severity of the condition, the age of onset, and how long ago it began. The symptoms of autism can also change during adulthood. For example, children with autism might have trouble with language, whereas adults might show signs of improved communication abilities.","Mouth rashes or acne may also be a symptom of this condition.

What should I do if my skin feels red or irritated?


Answer: You can use a moisturizer to reduce redness. Do not apply lotions containing petroleum jelly (petrolatum) directly to your skin as this can cause irritation. Instead, use a mild non-comedogenic soap/soap solution on your hands or face at bedtime to help soothe and remove excess oil from your skin before going to sleep.

Question: I read on this site that your products contain a chemical called titanium dioxide or TiO2? Answer: yes, our products contain both titanium dioxide and titanium oxide. We would love to share more information about them as we've received many inquiries regarding these two ingredients recently. Our products do contain titanium dioxide, however, it's a natural product from the earth, so there shouldn't be any concern with it being present in cosmetic products. There are a few factors to take into account though that might make some consumers uneasy - titanium dioxide does have its benefits when used properly; it helps prevent skin aging while also brightening skin tones. Titanium dioxide has been proven safe for use in makeup applications as well, but what you may be less familiar with is titanium oxide, which is known as an oxidizing agent and can cause redness under certain circumstances. This will occur most often around the eyes. If you experience redness at the eye area due to using a sunscreen, try applying an additional layer of sunscreen overtop of your original one before trying out a new formula.

A little bit of research goes a long way, as well. You should always ask questions first. For example, if you don't know if the company uses chemicals like parabens (they don't), then you should definitely be asking. It doesn't hurt to check with your local or state health department as well.


Q: Is there anything else you'd like us to talk about?

A: Well, let's just say that our products are easy to apply and last longer than other ones. Just like how a great makeup looks once applied, our formulas last and look great as soon as they're applied!"
105,Question: wisdom tooth cuts gum pain\nAnswer:,"yes (it helps the gums heal)

Q: my toothache is gone after a year and I'm still having toothaches. Why?A: Some people don't have enough time to keep up with their daily activities, so they tend not to take care of themselves properly. They should be careful not to do anything strenuous that could aggravate or shorten their period. If you feel it's more important for you to get your period every month than you are to protect yourself from bad dental hygiene, then you will need to see your dentist regularly to check your teeth and gums for any signs of decay.","a tooth has to be cut before it can be removed.


Q: How often do you check your teeth?

A: I check my teeth only once or twice per week, and then the same day I am done with that check.


I wash them thoroughly after every brush and flossing (with dental floss). I also rinse all mouthpieces after each meal and snack.


For people who are prone to bleeding gums, brushing their teeth is not enough. You should clean your teeth regularly by using fluoride gel containing 5-10 percent fluoride. This will help reduce tooth decay. Fluoride treatment may be started as soon as possible after you begin seeing results from your regular dentist. It's important to get this treatment under control because the longer your periodontal disease goes untreated, the more damage it can cause. Your dentist will prescribe an appropriate dose for you based on how much of your body is exposed to fluoridated water. To find out what the fluoride concentration in your tap water is, call your local public health office or the Environmental Protection Agency. The National Academy of Sciences estimates that more than three million Americans drink fluoridated water, while another 10 million have the water supply supplied through drinking fountains, bathtubs, showers, and other sources.


Q: What about fluoride gel? What kind should I use?

A: In addition to fluoride tablets, fluoride gels include either 2% sodium fluoride (NaF) or 1% sodium chloride (NaCl) in water. Sodium fluoride comes from fluoridated salt. NaF is absorbed into your system faster than sodium chloride. Because these solutions contain more fluoride than tablets alone, they're safer and easier to swallow.


You can't overdose on fluoride gels; even very small amounts won't make you sick. However, gels don't protect against cavities like fluoride tablets do. If you use two types of fluoride gel together, both types must be used within 24 hours. So if you take one type at bedtime and one during the day, you must switch back and forth between gels. There are two different ways to apply fluoride gel: wetting the inside of your cheek with water and rubbing it into your gums over several minutes. Or, using a cotton swab dipped in water.

What is the difference between a wisdom tooth and a baby's baby? Wisdom teeth are very small and can be difficult to see during dental exams and x-rays. They have no root or main cavity, so they do not pose any risk of infection when swallowed by an infant. The number of wisdom teeth that will form depends on how many days are in the month (in months). A baby has one more than a person does at birth, but most children have 3 or 4 wisdom teeth. There may also be other types of wisdom teeth that need treatment such as crooked/nonworking ones, those that don't grow properly, or others that might become infected if left untreated.


Wisdom teeth are removed through dental extraction (duplication) of the tooth. When wisdom teeth are extracted, they typically heal within 12 hours with no permanent harm to the jaw. With age wisdom teeth start to harden and become more painful. In severe cases, a dentist can remove them completely using a radical tooth extraction procedure called Denture Extraction or Denture Reconstructive Procedures. Most people who suffer from dental problems eventually go on to have root canal treatment for these issues.","gum disease

Q: what is a wisdom tooth? Answer: the first of two molars. It grows in front of and behind your cheekbone. The upper one (or more often, both) are used to eat food or chew gum. The lower one is used for brushing. They're also used in other things like walking and yawning.


What causes wisdom teeth to disappear:

A person's genes determine whether a person will have all or some of their wisdom teeth removed when they reach adulthood. Those who don't get rid of them usually won't need surgery, but it can sometimes be necessary if there's pain from chewing too hard or swallowing too much saliva.


Why do people lose wisdom teeth? There aren't really any good answers; it could just be bad luck or not getting enough exercise as an adult. In addition, some experts say that people may lose wisdom teeth because of a medical problem, such as a dental infection, which makes it harder for the jawbone to heal properly. Some studies suggest that the longer you wait to get wisdom teeth out, the less likely you'll survive.


How should I care for my wisdom teeth? To keep them healthy, you should clean and floss them at least twice daily. You can use fluoride toothpaste, but avoid mouthwash with fluoride because some dentists recommend using only water with no fluoride and others don't recommend it. If you want to remove a few wisdom teeth yourself, follow these instructions from a dentist. Also see our tips for keeping wisdom teeth safe.","wisdom teeth


Q: Is there any medical evidence for the use of a diet containing soybean protein as an adjunct to treatment for chronic kidney disease?


A: The authors conclude that ""the present study does not support the use of dietary soy protein in patients with CKD."" They have no specific information about what supplements are used. The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed all of the available literature, including trials on diets and health outcomes, for this question. Their conclusion is shown below:

""...there was insufficient evidence of a beneficial effect of soy or its components in preventing chronic renal disease (CKD)...""


""There were also concerns regarding the lack of blinding and randomization. More studies would be needed to clearly demonstrate whether soy can reduce risk factors associated with CKD...""

Summary: There may be benefit from eating foods rich in soy protein in people who already consume them. For example, if you eat only a moderate amount of soy protein per day, you might have no more than 3 mg/day. That's quite low by Western standards - far lower than the FDA's upper limit of 6 mg/day for adults. Soyfoods may help those who don't yet feel well enough to manage their diabetes safely. And there are some studies suggesting that soy helps people lose weight when they're overweight. However, there isn't enough scientific evidence to say that it provides a clear advantage over other treatments for chronic kidney diseases.

2. Why do so many people ask me about wisdom teeth surgery?

They may think they will be able to prevent or reverse gum disease if their wisdom teeth are removed. However, this is not true for all cases. There can also be serious complications associated with removal of wisdom teeth. It's important that you understand the risks involved before deciding on wisdom tooth surgery. The following information outlines some common causes of wisdom tooth problems and how to avoid them.

The most common cause of problems with wisdom teeth is that they don't grow properly – this can lead to dental caries (eating disorder). This type of decay occurs when bacteria from plaque form an infection at the surface of the tooth. If left untreated, the bacteria can travel through your bloodstream, affecting organs like your heart, brain, bladder, liver, kidneys and lungs. As a result of these consequences, there are other types of diseases that occur more frequently in patients who have cavities in their wisdom teeth.

Other potential reasons why individuals would want wisdom tooth removal include:

Pain relief after a severe injury or illness

An extreme sensitivity to sound

Possible medical conditions

A desire to make it look younger

If you're considering wisdom tooth surgery, it's important to discuss possible adverse effects such as infection, pain and bleeding before making any decision. Discussing issues related to your health with your doctor can help him determine whether wisdom tooth removal should proceed. You can find out more by talking to your dentist, nurse practitioner or physician assistant.

3. What happens during wisdom tooth removal?

Wisdom tooth extraction involves cutting away the inner root portion of a wisdom tooth, while also removing the pulp layer of the tooth. In a typical procedure, doctors use a special tool called a dental drill to open up the tooth to get into its structure. They then remove the affected section using a laser and forceps. The process takes around 20 minutes. During this time, doctors perform a few checks to ensure the integrity of the tooth and keep it clean, including taking pictures of every part to document what has been taken out and replaced. After all the work is done, the patient returns home to recover.

4. How long does it take for wisdom tooth removal?

Some surgeons recommend waiting one month to two weeks between each operation but some prefer sooner. Depending upon how long the tooth needs to be cut away","some people

Q: I was told by a dentist that the only way to get a wisdom tooth out is to remove it. But when I visited my dentist for this procedure, I found out he had been using it for years and didn't have any problems with his teeth or gums. Can you please help? A: It seems most dentists are using it on their patients without telling them and they don't realize how long the use has really caused damage. This is why, if you find out someone's used it since they were young and haven't done anything wrong then it may be OK but if they're in the middle of serious dental work, then it's probably not worth doing at all.

Gum Problems That Are Not Wisdom Teeth","if they are the cause of your mouth discomfort, then ask for a dentist appointment. However, if they don't have any root causes, you can try to find something else that might be causing them.

Ask about how many teeth you need to replace.

If you don't know the answer and aren't sure which ones you should get, you should consult with a dentist or oral surgeon for an estimate of the number of teeth you'll need to replace. The most common procedure is dentures, but there are other options as well such as partial denture (which requires only the front three or four teeth) and full denture (which requires all five). For example, one person's lower lip could become so painful because his tongue was missing (a condition called ""dental abscess""), while another person's bottom line is that he needs six teeth (a condition called ""cavities""). If you think you may not want to keep any of those, it helps to think about what would happen if you had fewer teeth. You'll probably also want to talk to your doctor about how much surgery will cost and when you'll need to start having treatments.

It's good to know some general tips on dental care, too. For instance, getting the right amount of fluoride in your drinking water can help prevent cavities. Also, always clean your teeth with a soft toothbrush before bedtime and at least once a day; otherwise plaque builds up in your gums and cracks around the edges of your teeth making them feel uncomfortable.

Q8. How many days a week does your child get on the bus? If he gets off at school or work, how often is this done with one stop?

A8. He only gets on the bus once every 3-5 minutes (on average) and at least twice a day at work. I've seen him go for over an hour each time. Sometimes we drive to pick him up from his job in South Carolina and then take him back home because there are no public transportation options for us here.


He is currently taking Adderall. He takes it until 1pm almost everyday now. For some reason though, we haven't yet been able to make it happen that he would ride on the bus for longer than 2 hours. This is especially frustrating when all of our friends have cars so they can come pick him up at 4am and he still has not taken off the meds by noon and instead stays late.


I do not believe we will ever see him fully healthy again as long as he is using these types of drugs. It's like someone gave him a bunch of poison that makes him sicker rather than just give him medication.


Our insurance company has never called regarding our son after he was diagnosed. We were told they don't cover those type of medications and you must pay out of pocket. The last conversation we had about our son being on Adderall and if we need help we were told we didn't have any coverage. I feel the best way to protect my son is to keep him away from them.

Treatment & Prevention

There are several treatments available for the most common gastrointestinal disorders. Unfortunately, many people aren't able to find the help they require on their own, so doctors may refer patients to specialists who specialize in treating specific conditions.

1. Antiobiotic Therapy

Antibiotics have long been used as a treatment option for infections such as Clostridium difficile, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, HIV and tuberculosis, but the use of antibiotics for other types of digestive diseases remains controversial. In fact, only one type of antibiotic is approved specifically for use against intestinal worms (Helminthopper species).

In addition, despite being widely recognized as effective against parasites, only 10% to 20% of children treated for parasitic infection actually get better and about 50% don't go away completely. It is believed that parasite resistance develops over time and that it may take many years to eradicate all types of worm infection.

2. Probiotics

Some probiotics contain strains of bacteria called Lactobacilli, which are good at breaking down complex proteins. These organisms have also been shown to increase energy levels, decrease inflammation and improve gut flora balance. Since these beneficial bacteria are present naturally in the human gut, researchers believe that introducing them into an ill individual could potentially cure his or her illness, but more studies are needed.

3. Diet Changes

It is thought that people tend to eat too much refined grains and sugars and less vegetables and fruit than they otherwise should. Eating too many unhealthy fats (which often come from processed meat) contributes to inflammation in the body and plays a part in various chronic illnesses like obesity and diabetes. This imbalance between healthy food choices and overall calorie intake causes the symptoms associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as cramps, bloating and diarrhea.

Diets","Diarrhea is a very common and serious problem in the elderly. It can also be caused by many other things like infections, diabetes, or even the use of certain medications. You should see your physician for proper diagnosis and treatment.


Q: How do I know if my body chemistry has changed? Answer:


The best way to determine whether you have an imbalance in your hormones (i.e., estrogen levels are too high or too low) is by taking a blood test. The doctor will analyze your hormone level and then give you a prescription for medication that will change your hormonal balance to normal.


Q: What's the worst case scenario? Answer:


If you have an adrenal imbalance and suffer from severe symptoms, these may include: fatigue, mood swings, anxiety, restlessness, irritability, depression, trouble sleeping/sleeping too much, increased appetite, weight gain, and an overall increase in physical symptoms such as hair loss, skin rash, headaches, joint pain, etc. These symptoms may not appear immediately, but gradually worsen over time, leaving you feeling worse than before.


Q: Will all of this happen again after I get better? Answer: Yes! Your doctor will prescribe more hormone therapy until the problem resolves.","Treatment of diarrhea is difficult. Common treatments include antibiotics, antacids and oral rehydration solutions. The most effective treatment of diarrhea in patients with a history of constipation or frequent diarrhea is the use of fiber supplements. Fiber supplements are available both as tablet preparations and liquid beverages that can be taken by mouth; this is particularly important when treating children younger than 5 years old because they may not have full control over their bowel movements. Fructooligosaccharides are commonly used. If diarrhea continues for more than 3 days, a fecal incontinence device (FID) should be considered. A FID is an external anal sphincter device that attaches at the rectum to absorb stool into the anus. It works by pushing the stool down through the sphincters instead of up. This allows the patient to defecate without having to sit on it. FIDs usually last from 4 to 6 hours, but some patients may require longer periods. Some people who cannot tolerate FIDs will need to undergo a colonoscopy. Anorectal decompression surgery (ADCS), also called ""rectocele removal,"" is another option for those suffering from constipation. ADCS involves removing one or more of the segments of the rectocele. After ADCS, there is no need to change laxatives because the rectocele regrows and is filled with small intestine. Rectoceles should never be surgically removed because they cause permanent damage to the nerves that control bowel function. It may take several months after a successful ADCS for all of the residual tissue to disappear. The result is that a person's ability to pass stools normally returns. When ADCS is unsuccessful, a doctor may prescribe a variety of medications such as anti-diarrhea pills, dietitian counseling, and laxative suppositories. Because constipation is often associated with other symptoms, such as poor digestion, malabsorption problems, or fatigue, dietitians often recommend a multivitamin supplement along with the constipating food and/or medication. These medications often help improve quality of life and reduce stress levels. Many people believe that eating spicy foods helps constipation. However, research shows that spicy foods do not increase the risk of developing diarrhea. Although there is some evidence that spicy foods might lower blood pressure, the effect on constipation has been inconclusive. To determine whether you are sensitive to garlic, talk to your doctor about taking vitamin K2 capsules every day. Garlic","The key question is whether the effects of BH4 on these variables were due to increased activity or decreased activity. If they were due to increased activity, then it would be expected that those with the highest levels of BH4 should also have the greatest improvement in their symptoms while those with the lowest levels would see the least benefit from the treatment. Conversely, if the changes occurred because of diminished activity, the patients who had high amounts of BH4 and/or lower concentrations of ATP would still likely show some symptoms when given a low dose of BH4, which could explain why there was no clear statistical difference between the two groups. Thus, although we can say that reduced activity may reduce the likelihood of an adverse response, this does not necessarily mean that such responders will experience fewer negative side effects than those who do respond favorably. It is possible that both the magnitude of the responses (i.e., less or more severe) and the type of side effect are related. As discussed below, the exact nature of the relationship between factors, as well as the reason for differences observed between the two groups, need further investigation.

Effects on Cognitive Function.

We hypothesized that low doses of BH4 might help improve cognitive functioning. To test this hypothesis, three different measures of cognition were administered in our study group using multiple measures. We used two tests designed specifically to evaluate cognitive function in patients with IBS. The first measure was the Trail Making Test (TMT), a standard measure of working memory and decision making that has been found to predict future academic performance [36]. TMT scores were obtained before and after administration of 10 mg of BH4 via subcutaneous injection in 15 healthy adults. This dose elicited a significant increase in TMT scores compared to placebo, suggesting that increasing BH4 by 10 mg produced a measurable change in cognitive performance. The second measure was the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, a standard measure of attentional control [37], that provides information about the ability to use symbols as primary strategies during mental tasks [38]. While a moderate effect size was observed at baseline and at the end of the trial, participants receiving BH4 were able to perform substantially better after the 10 mg dose than after placebo. Moreover, a similar but stronger effect was seen after all doses of BH4. These results suggest that taking a 10 mg dose of BH4 resulted in significantly improved performance on a cognitive task involving working memory and other types of executive functions. Further, this suggests that reducing","C. I am a 32 year old man and have had several episodes of mild-moderate persistent nausea since my freshman year of college, usually after drinking alcoholic beverages. Each time I drank the alcohol it was very strong so when I woke up in the morning it felt like someone had hit me with a shovel, but without any pain or bruising. The worst day was probably around Christmas 2004 when I had about 10 beers in an hour (I'm not sure how many are counted as one). During this episode I couldn't even open the front door. There were no symptoms at all until the next night, then I didn't feel right for a few days afterwards. My stomach would swell and turn red and it would hurt to eat anything that wasn't solid.

F. My mom gave me a prescription for anti-diarrhea pills at age 14 that lasted for 3 years. When she took them out a while ago, her GI tract became inflamed and painful. She has never regained any weight and is diabetic. I don't think she wants to be on the meds anymore. What should we do? Help!

G. I have severe chronic fatigue syndrome/ME/myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic Lyme disease. And I can't exercise. Any ideas?

In 1994, during the summer vacation between my junior and senior high school years, I broke my arm in three places due to an accident that involved jumping off a cliff. I did not play sports again until I turned 18, because they were too dangerous. For most of the year","A. Symptoms may include sudden, severe stomach cramps and bloating, which is associated with abdominal pain; frequent bowel movements; weight loss or gain of water in the stool; fever (temperature greater than 102°F [38°C]); vomiting; a foul-smelling stool; dark colored stools; dehydration; loss of appetite and constipation; fatigue; anemia; skin rash; muscle aches; sore throat and neck; difficulty swallowing; cough; chest pain; shortness of breath; and chest congestion that does not go away. B. In many cases, these symptoms can be caused by certain infections such as typhoid fever, gastroenteritis, norovirus, meningococcal disease, and other viral illnesses. C. If diarrhea persists after the first few days of antibiotic treatment, antibiotics are required. D. In some children, acute diarrhea cannot be relieved until after age 1 month when they have become more resistant to antibiotics. E. The diagnosis of acute bacterial diarrhea requires an evaluation of the patient's underlying medical conditions.

Symptoms due to Clostridium difficile infection

In addition to gastrointestinal distress, patients with this condition often experience abdominal discomfort, nausea, cramping pain, vomiting, bloody stools, diarrhea, increased gas production, and fatigue or weakness.

The clinical picture for C. difficile infection differs from that seen in irritable bowel syndrome because the bacteria produce toxins that interfere with normal intestinal function, including those involved with digesting fiber. A number of factors can contribute to the development of C. difficile infection. Some common culprits are environmental contamination, poor nutrition and immunocompromised state, antibiotic use, and other infectious processes.

Clostridium difficile Infections in Children

Although the bacterium has been shown to cause illness in adults, most children who develop C. difficile infection do so during their infancy. Infants and toddlers are at greatest risk because the organism grows rapidly in their gut. As a result, infants' intestines may contain large amounts of organisms that help the organism thrive. This means they are particularly susceptible to developing an infection. A study in 2008 found that one out of five babies diagnosed with C. difficile was younger than 3 years old, and another 15 percent were under 2 years old. These findings underscore the need for early childhood intervention programs. Many of these efforts focus on educating parents about food safety and encouraging them to take a daily probiotic supplement","What are the best foods for healthy kidney function?

The most important thing is to get enough potassium and sodium. Both of these minerals help with regulating body temperatures, which affects blood pressure, electrolytes (potassium helps in keeping your water balance while salt controls fluid volume) and muscle contraction. This also means that a high potassium intake will prevent excessive muscle cramping, as well as help you control your thirst better.

Additionally, a diet high in fruits, vegetables and grains can help keep your kidneys functioning properly. The carbohydrates in these foods help to lower your cholesterol levels and prevent your arteries from clogging up. Fruits like bananas, oranges and avocados are particularly rich in fiber and antioxidants that work to protect against certain diseases like cancer and cardiovascular disease.

Dysautonomia is also known as autonomic neuropathy, autonomic dysfunction, autonomic imbalance or autonomic impairment. The autonomic nervous system controls all functions of the entire body including digestion, breathing, blood pressure, muscle tone, heart rate and heartbeat. Dysautonomia causes a variety of symptoms including fever, headache, chills, vomiting, dizziness, weakness, poor concentration, difficulty thinking, feelings of anxiety, irritability, depression, loss of appetite and many more. It is often difficult for patients who are experiencing these symptoms to describe what they are feeling because they do not know why their bodies respond differently from other people when they experience these same symptoms. In this article, we will discuss some common questions patients have about dysautonomia and how to better manage them if you are suffering from it.

How does dysautonomia cause symptoms?

The autonomic nervous system regulates every function of your body including digestion, metabolism, respiration, circulation, immune responses, and much more. Dysautonomia can be caused by anything or someone causing an imbalance in the body's regulation of these systems. If there is a disorder where your body lacks certain hormones necessary to regulate your nervous system then your body has issues regulating itself. When this happens, your brain thinks its doing fine but it isn't so your body responds to any situations like you would expect without actually having any problems with regulating itself. Dysautonomia most commonly occurs when there is a lack of certain natural hormones in your body such as thyroid hormone and/or adrenal hormones which are essential for the proper functioning of the central nervous system. This makes sense since the CNS is responsible for controlling a number of functions, including digestion, muscle movement, cardiovascular function, respiratory function, etc.

In CFS, the normal level of thyroid hormones is either too low or too high making the body think that everything is okay. A person with hyperthyroidism will get hypothyroidism which means that the body needs more thyroid hormone than it normally produces. Hypothyroidism can lead to weight gain, lethargy, fatigue, decreased energy levels, hair loss, brittle nails and mood swings. Another example of thyroid hormone imbalance is Hashimoto's disease which is characterized by an overproduction of thyroid hormone leading to elevated thyrox","These symptoms, as well as others listed above are all symptoms of a medical condition. They may be temporary and vary from person to person. If you think you have a medical condition, it is important that you seek the advice of your doctor before taking any supplements or medications.

The following list describes what we believe are the most common health problems associated with magnesium deficiency in Western cultures. Please note that there are many other conditions which can occur in people who lack sufficient amounts of magnesium and these may not be included in this list.","If you're already experiencing the symptoms of dysautonomia, and you are also taking any of these medications, your physician may start you on one or more of those medications along with a gluten free diet."
109,Question: ehlers danlos syndrome POTS nausea stomach pain\nAnswer:,"The best way to describe EDS is to say it's a combination of dyspepsia, heartburn and acid reflux. The symptoms will vary from person to person but they all have similar characteristics. The most common symptom is flatulence that can come in the form of a burning sensation or as a constant sour smell. Some people also experience constipation, diarrhea, bloating, vomiting, abdominal discomfort and weight loss.

What Causes It?

There are several possible causes for EDS. Although each case may seem different there seems to be a link between the three conditions.

One of the main factors contributing to EDS is the size of your intestines (duodenum) as well as whether you have small intestines or large ones. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth occurs when bacteria in the gut become more abundant than normal. This condition may result in an inflamed colon which can lead to chronic inflammation and chronic health problems including diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Large intestinal bacterial overgrowth is caused by poor digestion resulting in insufficient amount of nutrients reaching the intestines. There are many types of bacterial overgrowth which include:

Staphylococcus aureus

Enterobacteriaceae

Gram-negative rods

Firmicutes

Probiotics

Celiac disease

A number of digestive disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome can contribute to bacterial overgrowth causing bloating and gas. This is another reason why GERD and other GI issues are so important to diagnose before the underlying cause is discovered. Also, some medications like antacids, metronidazole and antibiotics can contribute to EDS.

Another factor contributing to EDS is how much fiber you consume per day. Fiber helps with absorption of vitamins and minerals. People who eat a high fiber diet tend to be less likely to develop EDS. Foods rich in fiber include:

Brown rice

Wheat germ

Spinach

Wild rice

Lentils

In addition, eating a diet low in processed foods can help prevent and treat EDS. These types of diets include:

Low calorie diets – especially restricting sugary drinks and sweets

Exercise

Vitamin supplements

When Should I See My Doctor About EDS?

If you think your symptoms are related to the gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), you should see a doctor immediately. If you are","yes

How to treat: The first thing is that you need a doctor to check your blood pressure. If it's higher than 120/80, then they can start with medication that lowers the heart rate and thus reduce the symptoms of this disorder. However, if your blood pressure is more normal (less than 140/90) then they should not start treatment until you take medications such as dantrolene or aspirin. There are also many other things you can do such as drinking plenty of water or taking beta blockers to lower your blood pressure, but we will talk about these in detail later on. For now just keep moving forward and ignore any bad news from your doctor. The good news is that you have an incredible support group at your disposal. You don't know how great it would be for someone who has been through what you did if there was someone else like them around.

If you are looking for support groups outside of the ones listed above, we highly recommend you join our facebook community. It is full of other people who suffer from Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS). We have over 930 members so far and discuss all sorts of issues related to the disorder. Our Facebook page is called EDS Support Group where you can ask questions or share your stories. This is one of the best ways to get help because you can tell everyone you meet about what you've been going through.","yes, as it is a combination of two conditions. The first one is hirsutism and the second one is an enlarged spleen that often causes blood in your urine (and you should never give any medicines containing metformin to pregnant women).

Question: what causes hirsutism? Answer: Hirsutism is caused by too much estrogen in your body. When you have excessive amounts of estrogen in your body, it can cause a lot of problems including hair loss, excess facial and body hair growth, acne, weight gain, irregular menstrual periods, male infertility and sterility. In fact, only about 50% of people with this condition get it cured. So if you suffer from it or just want to prevent it, there are some things that you can do for sure. First of all, you need to lose some of the excess amount of estrogen in your system before you get it again. As an example, you could stop taking certain medications such as birth control pills for at least six months or take a contraceptive pill every day. However, there's also a risk involved if you use sex toys. For instance, a woman who uses vibrators when she has heavy periods will probably be affected by hirsutism. If you really want to know more about the risks associated with using sex toys, you might wish to ask your gynecologist.

Question: where does hirrotism come from? Answer: It's a side effect of a medication called clomiphene citrate. Clomiphene is used to treat menopause symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats. This drug is most commonly prescribed for post-menopausal women suffering from severe symptoms such as hot flashes or night sweats. You may also be given it on its own for other reasons such as anxiety or depression. The problem occurs because it increases estrogen levels in your body which causes your body to produce too much hormones. One of these hormones is estrogen so it becomes very dangerous. The increased amount of estrogen leads to the production of a hormone that is similar to testosterone in the female body and this hormone then goes into your bloodstream and eventually reaches your ovaries. These hormones may cause unwanted effects like premature aging and breast enlargement. Your doctor needs to check whether you are getting enough natural estrogens such as those found in foods or through supplements. It is important not to use clomiphene while having children since the potential side effects are even worse. Also, make sure you don't abuse the drugs such as drinking alcohol","POTS POTS POTS POTS POTS POTS

The answer to the question is yes, you are right. If your doctor has done a normal blood test for diabetes and is looking at your EDS and asking if it might be related to obesity then they will probably ask you about weight loss in general. This means you have been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and are being advised to lose weight but don't know how much weight you should expect to get rid of. Your symptoms could relate to one or both of these diseases which can affect a variety of other systems. When dealing with this type of condition you need to keep all your options open as it is not just about losing weight that will help but also keeping it off over a long term period of time. One way to do this is by following good lifestyle habits such as eating healthy food and getting plenty of exercise.","yes, but it is so very mild that it does not affect your daily life in any way.

Q. Should I take my medications as prescribed or with an oral supplement?

A. You should always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist. Taking medication orally may be more effective and less likely to cause side effects than taking pills. If you have taken a prescription medicine within the past seven days you should consult your physician before taking any new one as this could lead to adverse reactions or changes in how well these medicines work. The most common prescription medicines for POTS include: beta-blockers (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil); calcium channel blockers (e.g., sotalol, lisinopril) that are used when your heart rate is above 70/min; antihypertensives such as nitrates, phenylephrine or epinephrine; ACE inhibitors (such as amlodipine, celecoxib or ergotamine); corticosteroids (prednisone, prednisolone); beta-adrenergic agonists such as digoxin, guanethidine, levetiracetam, indomethacin; angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drugs such as etoricoxib or rizatriptan; calcium channel blockers such as valsartan, cyclosporine or cyclophosphamide; calcium channels blockers such as prasugrel and tamsulosin; glucocorticoid receptor antagonists such as doxazosin or zaleplon; histamine H 2 -receptor antagonist drugs such as meloxicam or nimodipine; magnesium sulfate and mineral oil (for those who need the extra help of these agents). In addition to these drugs, there are other drugs available on the market which can also have therapeutic applications. These include acetaminophen, aspirin, thienopyridines, tricyclics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, salbutamol, benztropine, flumetomide, gabapentin, memantine, metformin, probenecid, carbamazepine, gatifloxacin, oxcarbazepine, erythromycin, and others.

Q. What is the treatment for paresthesia or dizziness associated with my POTS symptoms?

A. Your physician will discuss the causes of your dizz","This is a common cause of anxiety in patients with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS). Nausea, abdominal pain and bloating are among the most prominent symptoms. Other causes include kidney stones, high blood pressure, thyroid disorders and autoimmune diseases such as Lupus or Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Your doctor will recommend that you take anti-inflammatory medicines to relieve some of these symptoms. You may also need to see your physician for regular physical exams.

You should also be aware that when vomiting occurs frequently this can lead to dehydration, which is very dangerous. So it's important not to drink much during this time period. This can help avoid dehydration in other stages of EDS.","yes


Q: can you have a low blood sugar? Can you be diabetic with this? A: Low blood sugars are sometimes the first symptom of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. Diabetes is an endocrine disorder in which the body does not make enough insulin. The problem with POTS is that, even though the patient may feel well, her blood sugar level remains abnormally high because she has no way to control it. The only way out is for her to use insulin. This could lead to dangerously high blood sugars that would cause a stroke or heart attack. If someone was experiencing a very mild form of POTS and had been taking insulin without any problems, they might think that they were just having a little bit of a bad day when they had their regular breakfast. However, if the person is getting dangerously high blood sugar levels for no known reason, then it's time to get them checked out by their doctor. If there is also other evidence of underlying diabetes, such as hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), this will need to be treated too. In the meantime, the symptoms can be controlled by eating healthy foods like whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and low-fat dairy products (such as yogurt) and staying physically active. Q: What causes these problems? A: POTS affects all parts of the body and can affect the brain. Some people have multiple types of POTS and experience different physical and cognitive challenges at different times throughout their lives. There is no single factor responsible, but genetics seems to play some role. It can occur along a genetic chain, with genes involved starting off from common variations in gene expression patterns and gradually accumulating over several generations. For instance, children who are born with a specific mutation affecting the beta 3 adrenergic receptor gene may develop POTS later on. A child whose parents have a rare condition called Cushing's disease that results in elevated levels of catecholamines can also develop POTS. Q: Is there anything else I should know about POTS? A: You should definitely tell your family doctor what type of diabetes you're currently dealing with so that he/she can monitor you more closely. There is also a risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, which requires continuous monitoring of blood glucose. With POTS, blood sugar levels cannot go below 100 mg/dL for prolonged periods of time, which means that your doctor needs to keep track of your blood sugar levels constantly. Also, the nerves in your face, feet, arms, legs, hands, head","It is not possible to treat a disease that does not exist.

Q11: I was diagnosed with EDS in my thirties when I took a course of antidepressants for depression and anxiety. A few years ago, I noticed changes in my skin; they became rough and dry and itchy. Is this EDS? If so, what causes it? I've also had a cough-like feeling for several months now. Should I see a doctor about these symptoms? Answers (from the doctors) - Dr. D.: EDS is an umbrella term which includes many conditions including, but not limited to, cystic fibrosis, seborrhoeic dermatitis, psoriasis, erythema multiforme, and scleroderma. Most cases are caused by a genetic predisposition. EDS has been shown to be more common among African Americans. The exact cause is unknown but it is thought to involve some combination of genetic predisposing factors such as increased cortisol levels and decreased adrenal activity, among other things. The best treatment options include medications, psychological treatments, nutrition, stress management and dietary modifications.

Q12: My husband's aunt passed away, and his mother went through chemo for breast cancer. Both of them were extremely obese. They both suffered from extreme fatigue and constant hunger, both during and after the treatment. I am concerned because of their weight. What can we do to help our friend cope with her illness? Answer: Weight loss can help alleviate your loved one's symptoms, but it isn't a cure. People who are overweight tend to have higher rates of serious health problems and diseases that result in premature death. Fat people who take part in physical activities or exercise regularly often experience reductions in fatigue and joint stiffness, which makes them feel better. So far, no studies show any link between obesity and longevity, but there have been studies suggesting a link to high blood pressure and diabetes. To prevent your loved one from gaining too much weight, talk to him/her about healthy eating habits and a balanced diet. Your loved one needs regular exercise, too. You should encourage your loved one to get involved in physical activities even if he or she doesn't like doing them. Exercise helps burn fat, improves bone density and keeps muscles strong. And you can encourage your loved one to try new foods. Remember, even if your loved one loses weight, it won't eliminate all of his/her symptoms.","it's a very common problem in POTS. It can be caused by many things but they are not all equal.

The main factors are the following, and some more common ones too:

1) Lack of appetite 2) Bloating 3) Diarrhea 4) Anxiety 5) Pain 6) Muscle weakness 7) Weight loss 8) Skin problems 9) Changes to your blood sugar 10) Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) 11) Heartburn 12) Constipation 13) Colds 14) Headaches 15) Nausea 16) Dry skin 17) High cholesterol 18) Chronic fatigue 19) High blood pressure 20) Sore throat 21) Low energy 22) Increased sweating 23) Irregular menstrual cycle 24) Joint pain 25) Memory problems 26) Loss of sex drive 27) Seizures 28) High blood pressure 29) Anemia 30) High cholesterol

If you're concerned about any of these symptoms, then get checked out at an emergency room for evaluation. If there is no medical cause for them, ask yourself why. Are you stressed? Do you have a diet that isn't working for you? Do you take medication that doesn't work well? These are all factors. They may be contributing to your pain or other symptoms.

What causes Ehlers Danlos Syndrome?

Ehlers Danlos syndrome (EDS), also known as myasthenia gravis syndrome (MGSS), is a chronic disease affecting one in every 100,000 people worldwide. The exact cause is unknown, but there is evidence pointing toward a genetic basis. People with EDS have two distinct types of collagen in their connective tissue, called type 1 collagen and type 2 collagen. Type 1 collagen has a higher density than type 2 collagen and helps support cartilage and bone. However, when this high-density collagen breaks down over time, causing fibrosis, it leads to the formation of scar tissue around joints, which can lead to joint pain, pitting, and arthritis. In addition, the increased production of collagen that occurs during healing after injury, such as from a fall, can contribute to joint pain. Additionally, people with EDS often develop a condition called osteoporosis because of decreased levels of calcium and phosphorus in their bones. This leads to weaker bone. People with EDS also tend to lose weight due to a decrease in the activity of the hormone ghrelin, which inhibits food intake. Finally, people with EDS often suffer from sleep apnea, or","yes POTS nausea stomach pain\n

Q. How do I know if my symptoms are due to POTS?


A. Symptoms of POTS can be caused by many factors, including dehydration, low potassium, excess sodium in the blood, and hyperventilation. But, a recent study found that POTS was most commonly linked to a hormone called renin which controls acid-base balance.2 Renin deficiency may result from decreased production or impaired function of this gland.3 The symptoms of POTS can range from mild fatigue to severe muscle weakness resulting from shortness of breath, constricted airways, and breathlessness. If you have any of these symptoms, or have any questions about them, we recommend consulting your doctor. Q. My symptoms do not seem consistent with POTS and I still suspect that I'm having some sort of underlying problem (such as an eating disorder or thyroid issue). What should I do now?


A. There is no simple test for POTS, so it's difficult to confirm diagnosis. You will need to get more specific information about what's causing your symptoms. For instance, you may want to see your doctor if you notice any changes in how much energy you are using when trying to exercise, how often you fall asleep at night, or if you feel unwell while watching TV. Also, make sure that other people around you who also have POTS don't notice anything unusual. It's hard to diagnose POTS in isolation; thus, it's important to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms before taking a further medical step. Q. Do all people with POTS experience symptoms similar to those described here?


A. According to Dr. Zebis' article ""POTS-An Overview,"" there were 1,004 cases of POTS diagnosed during his period of research between 1974 and 1996.4 Of those people with POTS, 75% had a history of gastrointestinal problems. As shown in Table 5 below, most people with POTS experienced fatigue/fatigue related to the following:1) Difficulty maintaining adequate fluid levels within the body;2) Muscle cramps during exertion or sleep;3) Shortness of breath;4) Nausea;5) Vomiting;6) Excessive sweating;7) Frequent urination;8) Irritability/anger;9) Headache;10) Depression;11) Anxiety;12) Tiredness;13) Changes in sexual desire/performance;14) Un"
112,Question: symptoms of asthma\nAnswer:,"cough

The child was taken to the emergency department after experiencing coughing and wheezing for several days. It is not known if the child had asthma or another respiratory illness. There were no obvious signs or symptoms that would indicate a true allergic reaction, such as skin rash, hives or shortness of breath. The child continued to be admitted to hospital for 3 more days before he was discharged home with treatment. During this time his condition deteriorated rapidly; he started vomiting blood frequently, lost weight, became extremely ill (vomiting up to 15 times per day), was unable to sleep and had seizures. He died on 4th July 2013 aged 11 months old at home in Australia. A report will be prepared for the coroner's court.


In conclusion, this case highlights how children can be misdiagnosed as having an allergy and that some symptoms are difficult to distinguish from other illnesses, including gastroenteritis.


The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases states that ""anytime there is any doubt, it is best to seek prompt medical attention"". We recommend that parents get their child checked out by a paediatrician or allergy specialist for a thorough history and to obtain detailed information on their child's health. This way it is possible to identify any underlying medical conditions or allergies which might affect the diagnosis.","In children with asthma, symptoms of wheezing and breathlessness should be checked for each child.

2) Question: What is the difference between wheeze and anaphylaxis? Answer: Both a common type of allergic reaction called ""wheezing"" and an allergy to proteins in foods such as peanuts, milk or eggs can cause severe breathing problems. The problem comes from a combination of the reaction and what the body does to fight it.

3) Question: Can you give me more information about the treatment of asthma (in particular, how long-term use of inhaled corticosteroid medication may lead to further respiratory issues)?


4) Question: Do I have to take medications just because I am having a severe acute attack?

5) Question: Are there any special types of medicines that are prescribed for asthma patients?

6) Question: How many times per day do my inhalers need to be changed?

7) Question: Is there an advantage to using inhalers alone rather than taking drugs?

8) Question: If my asthma attacks continue, will these get worse over time, or if so, which medications should I try first?

9) Question: Will my bronchial tubes eventually stop working completely?

10) Question: Should I continue to take inhaled steroids when my asthma becomes worse?

11) Question: When I was younger, were you able to play sports successfully? Answer: Yes, although many kids cannot run, jump or perform other tasks because they develop chronic lung disease caused by their asthma.


12) Question: If I get a cold or flu, do I need to go into an emergency room? What happens there if I don't cough up all the germs? What should I tell them? Answer: You do not necessarily need to see the doctor immediately if your sore throat starts getting worse. However, if you feel better without coughing up some mucus, then head to the nearest emergency room. It's important to stay alert and keep track of your condition until you are well enough to drive yourself home. Also, be sure to let the ER staff know that you had an attack -- this is very important since they may decide to send you straight back out there.","symptoms of asthma\

Q8. What should I do if my child is having a fever that does not stop when I take the medicine?

A8. If your child has a fever for more than 4 days, do not give him or her any medicines (unless you know how to use them). Call the doctor right away. Tell all health care providers and pharmacists who treat your child about what happened. Do not stop giving the medicine without checking with the doctor first. Keep taking the medication as soon as it works. Check with your doctor right away if your child's fever continues or stops suddenly. A sudden decrease in fever may be an emergency.

What are other risks from using this medicine?

Many children have side effects that happen after they start using this medicine. These usually go away on their own over time, but some can last for weeks or months. The most common ones are:


drowsiness or feeling tired

rash or burning skin at the site where the medicine was given

an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients in the medicine

diarrhea or stomach ache

Q7. If I have a cough and/or sore throat, do I need to be worried?

A7. Yes, you should keep an eye on it. If the wheezing or difficulty breathing persists for more than two days, see your doctor.


Q8. What if I'm having trouble breathing while sleeping?

A8. This is usually due to a blocked airway and may indicate that something is wrong with your lungs. Your breath may feel like it's coming in very fast or slow; it may seem as though you can't take deep breaths at all (even when you try); you may experience shortness of breath even when you're lying down; and you could have trouble with swallowing. These are typical signs of a respiratory infection which will require further tests and possibly surgery. The best way to help you sleep is to make sure you've got plenty of rest so your body has time to heal and recover. See our article about how to get some good quality sleep.


Q9. How long does it take my body to adjust to a new medication?

A9. A lot depends on the drugs and other medications you take. Sometimes people start taking one drug and then another within a few months. It takes several weeks before you really become ""used"" to a new medicine. For example, you'll probably notice less pain after starting to use a medicine called ibuprofen, but you may not feel better right away. It also takes weeks for your body to accept the effect of a new drug such as pyrimethamine, so you should continue to avoid using these medicines during this process.


Q10. Do I need to change anything else about my diet or exercise routine?

A10. Not unless you want to. You don't necessarily need to stop smoking completely. There's no evidence that quitting smoking reduces the risk of heart disease or stroke. In fact, in a study published in 2006, researchers found that smokers who quit had a higher rate of death from all causes compared to those who continued their habit. Smoking cessation programs offer many benefits to people trying to quit smoking, including increased rates of smoking-cessation success in terms of fewer cigarettes smoked per day, greater reductions in lung cancer deaths, and decreased likelihood of relapsing and continuing to smoke. Other lifestyle changes include increasing physical activity levels and limiting alcohol intake. See our page on tobacco control for more information.

A: The number one item on my list of concerns when starting as an assistant professor was ""what do I actually teach?"" After doing a bit more research about assistantships (and having some success with them), I decided to find out if there were any resources available for new faculty who wished to apply to be assistant professors. For those interested in applying, here is information about our Assistant Professor Program.

Q7: How much experience do you need before applying to become an Associate Professor at Michigan State University? Answer: At this time, it is not recommended that candidates have more than two years of teaching experience, but as we move forward with hiring decisions, we may consider additional qualifications or training needed by applicants.

-Assistant Dean of Academic Affairs


""What do you mean I'm not qualified to be an associate professor?!""

I know how hard it can be to start as an assistant professor! Many people are intimidated by the process. That's why I want to help you understand what you're getting into. If you look through our website, you'll see that we have many great articles specifically about becoming an assistant professor. These include links to job postings, videos, syllabi, academic journals, etc. Just look around, and get comfortable! We'll also give you plenty of advice and references so you won't feel discouraged.

If you'd like, you could contact us for further support. Our email address is [email protected]

Q8: Why do you say that it is unlikely that someone who has never taught has a shot at being selected as an assistant professor? Answer: It just simply isn't possible. The selection committee looks at each applicant individually. Therefore, if you are not familiar with our teaching programs, it would be highly unlikely that we would offer you a spot.

question: did you know that there are several medications that have been shown to reduce the risk of death from heart disease? Answer: I knew, but didn't read about it. Did you know that a medication called metoprolol lowers your risk of heart attack by 45%? Did you know that if you take these medications for 10 years you will live longer than someone who doesn't? (In fact, people taking these drugs lived longer on average.) Was I aware of these facts? Yes, this was clearly stated in my book and has been repeated many times since then.

My guess is not so good as to say that Dr. Oz is lying or misrepresenting his information, but it's just that he may be unaware that he has been doing something wrong at least with respect to what he has done as an expert commentator on health matters. And if so, it would seem pretty odd that he would choose to present himself as an authority on nutrition when he appears to have done very little research on the subject.

I'm sure that Dr. Oz can do better—but we're talking about someone who apparently believes that he is qualified as ""an expert"" and who seems to believe that he knows everything about everything. He's certainly got a lot of free time, which may explain why he seems to think that he is capable of presenting himself as an authority on all things diet-related—and that the audience should trust him because he is an ""expert."" It'd be like me writing a book about how to cook pasta while having never cooked pasta before; it's unlikely that the author of The New Diet Revolution or The China Study would end up as credible as those authors were on their own.","yes

A. The following agencies provide services to children with asthma in the San Diego area:

Diagnosis Question: My son has been having trouble breathing in recent weeks. His breath sounds like he is holding his breath. He also coughs up mucus. What is wrong? Answer: You may be experiencing phlegm, which is a fluid that contains air trapped in tiny pockets. The lungs do not work well with this type of fluid because they lack proper airflow. When your child has difficulty breathing, the most commonly diagnosed cause could be allergies. Other possible causes include sinusitis, pneumonia, an infection of the lung tissue or even cancer. It is important for you to seek medical attention when these types of illnesses occur as your doctor can give you more information about your child's condition and make any necessary treatment decisions. For additional answers, please visit our Asthma FAQ page.

Diagnosis Question: We were wondering how we would know our baby is growing properly? Answer: There are several signs that will help you determine whether your baby is growing normally. Most babies begin to show growth spurts between 2-4 months old, so it is important to pay close attention to what your baby does during those first few months. Watch for changes such as decreased appetite, increased sleeping time, weight gain, excessive wet diapers, etc... If your baby seems to be growing at an abnormal rate, it should prompt you to take him/her to see a pediatrician. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends regular monitoring by your doctor throughout infancy.

What Should I Do About my Child's Infantile Paralysis (IP)? IP is sometimes referred to as infantile epilepsy, and is a serious neurological disorder affecting primarily infants younger than one year. If left untreated, infants with IPD may suffer from seizures or developmental delays associated with their condition. Infants who do not receive appropriate therapies and support from parents can experience significant social and emotional issues, loss of independence, and limited quality of life.


The American Epilepsy Society estimates approximately 20 children die each day in the U.S. due to epilepsy, including those with IP. Children under 1 year of age affected by IPD are particularly vulnerable to developing problems such as developmental delay, mental retardation, poor feeding habits, physical deformities, and other health complications that can lead to death.

Q. Is it true that eating eggs can prevent cancer? Answer: This is not a well-known fact. But there are some people who are worried about their cholesterol levels, so they might try egg yolks as a way to lower those numbers. However, other studies suggest that egg consumption does not actually reduce cardiovascular disease risk in healthy individuals.

Q. Do you know how many grams of fat in an egg or how long it would take to digest it if you ate one? Answer: We do not know what this food contains because these data are based on commercial recipes. It's probably around 1/2 gram of fat per serving.

Q. What about eating oatmeal, which has a much higher fat content than regular cereal? Answer: Oatmeal is a very high source of fiber, iron, magnesium and folate. And it can be found all over the place – from cereals to cookies to cakes to muffins. One cup of oats provides 5 calories (and 0 g of fat).

Q. Can I eat almonds without worrying about heart health? Answer: Almonds contain trace amounts of two compounds that are potentially harmful in large quantities. These compounds are called carotenoids and lutein, both of which are present in significant quantities in green leafy vegetables like spinach and kale. In smaller doses, these nutrients can help lower blood pressure, decrease the risk of cancers such as breast and prostate cancer and possibly even lower the chance for diabetes mellitus. Eating too many of them might raise your LDL cholesterol level, though, which could ultimately lead to problems down the road. A couple tablespoons of raw pistachios is another good choice."
114,Question: borderline personality disorder symptoms\nAnswer:,"In some cases, such as those with mood dysregulation or obsessive-compulsive problems, the person may not be fully aware of what is going on.

 Borderline personalities can use a variety of manipulative and deceptive behaviors to get their way in relationships. They usually have difficulty regulating emotional expression, especially anger. The person's thoughts are often unreliable and unstable, making it difficult for them to know what they should do in certain situations. Borderlines' self-image often involves intense feelings of guilt or shame that cause an inability to function at work, school, or social settings.

Borderline Personality Disorder Symptoms: How Can I Manage Them?


The most important thing to remember about borderline personality disorder (BPD) is that there is no one ""right"" way to treat a BPD patient; everyone responds differently to treatment. For example, you might find it helpful if someone has been diagnosed with BPD before trying to change their behavior, even when their symptoms appear less severe than yours. It isn't unusual for people to feel guilty, ashamed, and embarrassed about having BPD because these feelings can trigger anxiety and depression. These feelings must be treated just like any other psychological condition. Your goal should always be to reduce stress and increase resilience—not perfectionism and perfectionistic thinking. When treating a BPD patient, it is important to understand their unique challenges so that you can effectively tailor your plan to meet each individual's needs.

While there are many different ways to treat borderline personality disorder, it is important to realize that a number of the treatments that are most commonly used don't help all patients successfully. You can help determine which treatments work best by reading through our article on the most common approaches to treatment and then discussing this information with your doctor. There also are several types of medication that can be used to treat borderline personality disorders including antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and mood stabilizers. We also recommend starting with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can be very effective with BPD patients. It helps patients learn how to manage their emotions while staying focused on improving behaviors. This type of therapy does not involve talking therapies but rather developing strategies to improve a person's ability to adapt to changes that occur in their life. In addition, the treatment typically requires a monthly commitment to attend weekly group sessions for at least eight weeks to help develop skills needed to cope with stressful life events.

Are there any specific symptoms","the first 2 weeks of treatment, and for 3 months after that.

If you have not been taking an antidepressant at all, then try to keep your dose as low as possible. It takes about 8 weeks to get a response from an antidepressant, but it may be worth trying again if you don't see results in the first few sessions. As far as the severity of depression goes, the best course of action is to start with lower doses and work up gradually (a little every week or two). For those who are very depressed, there is no evidence-based guideline on how much to take at any one time; however, it seems safe to say that the usual recommended daily dosage is 1 mg per kg body weight.

It should also be noted that there is some evidence suggesting that long-term use of SSRIs can induce hypomania in certain cases - this does not seem likely to occur with antidepressants other than SSRIs. Anecdotally, I've heard reports of people taking antidepressants for years before developing hypomanic episodes. This tends to happen more commonly among people who had a history of mania prior to their SSRI prescription. This effect has not yet been scientifically studied; so while it's certainly something to consider, we still do not know whether it occurs more frequently in people with bipolar disorder.

The main reasons why someone would want to stop using a psychotropic drug include anxiety, insomnia, decreased sex drive and/or libido and nausea (this last one doesn't apply to all SSRIs). These will usually improve quickly without stopping the medication. If you experience these problems when you are starting out with antidepressants, it could be worth asking your doctor what sort of support he or she provides to people struggling with depression. Also, the risk of suicide and self harm increases dramatically if a person is depressed - especially once the suicidal thoughts start occurring. In addition to feeling more depressed, your ability to feel enjoyment and pleasure in life may decrease greatly (there is a good chance that depression itself might make you less likely to engage in pleasurable activities, though there's no definitive proof that either are directly caused by depression). There are various treatments available, such as cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness meditation, which help in reducing your depressive symptoms and preventing relapse into depression. Your doctor can guide you towards the right ones for you.

Some common side effects of antidepressants include constipation, dry mouth and fatigue. Long term use may lead to osteoporosis, although studies have shown that this","Borderline Personality Disorder - BPD is a mental health condition that can cause a person to have problems regulating emotions, making decisions and making connections with others. It's considered by some experts to be the most common mental illness in America. The average age of onset for adults with BPD is 20 years old and it can affect anyone at any time of their lives, but people are more likely to begin experiencing these issues as they approach adulthood. What is BPD? Bipolar Disorder (Bipolar) Disorder is a mental health disorder that involves changes or mood swings in your brain. These shifts can happen suddenly and unpredictably, over weeks or months. Some people with bipolar disorder experience manic episodes during which they feel extremely energetic, talk a lot about new things or show unusual energy levels, while other times they may experience depressive episodes when things get difficult. Sometimes there are also mixed phases or a ""split"" between what you might call an ""anxiety"" phase and a ""mania"" phase. Why do I have Borderline Personality Disorder? There are many possible reasons why someone could develop BPD, such as: A childhood history of being abused or neglected

A strong family history of mental illness

A biological predisposition towards developing BPD

Experiencing stressors prior to diagnosis

Having poor self-image, low self-esteem or poor functioning in social situations

Neglecting important responsibilities or losing them due to depression, anxiety, substance abuse or physical challenges

Being sexually assaulted or traumatized in a way that led to lasting effects on personal relationships Borderline Personality Disorder - Treatment of BPD For people who struggle with bipolar disorder, treatment usually begins with medication. However, there are several different types of medications that help treat BPD, including: Ativan (lorazepam)

Abilify (aripiprazole)

Paxil (paroxetine hydrochloride)

Clonidine (clorgyline hydrochloride)

Fluphenazine (Prozac) You should speak with your doctor if you're taking one of these medications and want to know how they may interact with each other. Other treatments include cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy.

For example, while some people go through periods where they are unable to drink alone, others find themselves able to do so without assistance from their drinking friends. Alcoholics do struggle with a lot of problems related to addiction. Asking someone else to help them deal with these issues is not the same as being in recovery.""

How many hours per week do you spend in AA meetings?

Answer: ""I usually attend one-to-one sessions during the day and two-hour group sessions at night. There are no set limits for how long you can attend either session or group, although most members will typically attend between four and six hours a week.""

Do you feel that AA is helpful for coping with life's challenges?

Answer: ""AA is definitely helpful for dealing with life's challenges. If you aren't comfortable discussing such sensitive topics with an alcoholic, then finding a counselor who understands those types of concerns could really benefit you. There is nothing wrong with having a good time and enjoying the fellowship. But there is something very wrong when your problems are only addressed by a drinking friend. You could be missing out on so much.""","I don't know

I have been asked this question more than once. The answer is simple but it takes some time to put into practice. It's a long-term plan that you need to follow if you are going to take the first step.

Step #1) Identify your needs

The things that people with BPD want from life include safety, meaning their family will be OK, meaning they won't be alone, meaning they can trust and depend on other people, meaning they will get what they want/need in relationships, meaning they are safe and loved and they feel better about themselves. Your relationship to others has to be compatible with all of those needs. That means for the foreseeable future you should do everything you can not to hurt or endanger others.

Some people say that it doesn't matter whether someone does or does not have BPD - it's how they act when they're around others that counts. But my experience tells me that that just isn't true. There are many people who will make an effort to control and protect others while still hurting them. The most common example that comes up is being abused by someone close to them because they believe that this makes them ""special."" That behavior needs to stop immediately. If you know someone has this tendency then try as best as possible to keep them away from vulnerable people. And you must continue to work at reducing any harmful behaviors (by talking with them regularly, finding out why they behave this way, correcting their actions, etc.) and keeping them safe.

For many people with BPD they also see situations where their needs aren't met (e.g., someone else leaves without saying goodbye). This is called abandonment and it can cause great distress because these people may think there is nothing wrong with abandoning someone. When that happens, it's important to remember that BPD individuals often view abandonment differently from other people; instead of thinking that it's unacceptable or unhealthy to abandon another person, they tend to blame the other person, even though the other person was responsible for leaving and could easily have made alternative arrangements. They may believe that the person they abandoned wants to harm them or leave again or, sometimes, they don't understand how or why the abandonment happened. So when a person is experiencing abandonment, it's very important to look carefully into why they felt unloved and misunderstood. You might find that a lot of these feelings are related to feeling like they were never accepted in the social world; however, this is something you'll have to","Borderline Personality Disorder and Schizophrenia - Fact Sheet (PDF)

National Alliance on Mental Illness","Yes, and they are very common. It is estimated that as many as 5 to 7 percent of the population has at least one borderline personality disorder symptom.

Q: What does a person with BPD look like?

A: People with Borderline Personality Disorder often have significant mood swings in their personalities (often referred to as emotional dysregulation), which can include extreme highs and lows, irritability, anger, impulsivity, self-destructive behavior, and even suicidal tendencies. These people may display two or more different emotions simultaneously at any given time, with no apparent reason why.

Q: How does one know if someone has BPD?

A: There is not an objective physical test for BPD. However, there are other tests that can be used to determine whether someone is experiencing symptoms of BPD. For example, by interviewing family members who regularly interact with the person with BPD, the therapist could determine how much the individual has changed over the course of years. If the symptoms continue to change, then this would indicate that BPD must be present.

Q: Is it possible to treat borderline personality disorder?

A: Unfortunately, the only treatment available for BPD is medication. That said, there are some medications that can help manage symptoms, although these drugs also carry side effects. Also, therapy remains the most effective way of treating BPD.

The bottom line is that once you recognize that BPD exists, you need to get help! You will also find that your diagnosis doesn't mean you're doomed to live alone forever—many people manage to work through life's challenges without BPD.

What is Bipolar Disorder?

Borderline Personality Disorder is just one of many different disorders called ""bipolar"" or ""manic depressive illness."" Bipolar I disorders such as bipolar II (Bipolar II) typically occur when there are both high levels of energy and low amounts of energy in the same day. As a result, people experience a roller coaster ride of feelings and highs and lows.

People with Bipolar II disorder may experience mood swings from extremely positive (e.g., elated) days to depressed or sad ones. In addition, Bipolar II may cause anxiety attacks or panic attacks when manic episodes hit. At its worst, Bipolar II causes severe depression that can last months or longer.

Some research suggests that people diagnosed with Bipolar II do better on meds than those with other types of bipolar disorder. This is"

What is the most effective treatment for prostate cancer?

The standard of care is surgery to remove all or part of the prostate. This is known as radical prostatectomy, and there are many types of this procedure. For example, a prostatectomy called a DRA is done with a laser and may be used in men who have advanced stage disease and no other treatments are available. Other radical prostatectomies involve removing both the prostate and other parts of the urogenital system (such as the bladder), while others remove only one of these two systems. The last type is the PSA-based Prostate Cancer Treatment by Radiation (PCTR) which removes the entire prostate and its surrounding lymph nodes to improve survival rates.

Prostate cancer treatment depends on the cancer cell's type and location of metastasis. Different methods of treating prostate cancer can also depend upon the patients' age, symptoms, lifestyle habits, other risk factors, and the results of imaging tests. The following table summarizes the benefits and risks associated with prostate cancer treatments.

""Prostate Cancer and the PSA Test - The Evidence for a Connection""

Drs. Alan D. Cohen, Jeffrey B. Kupferberg, James M. Gifford & David L. Steinmetz

Medical Journal of Australia (May 1992) Vol. 161 No. 3 pp. 687-693

Abstract:

Introduction

Possible connection between prostate cancer and low levels of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

Method

Case series review of eight patients with clinically localized disease and prostate biopsy findings suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), six with diagnosed high-grade prostatitis (HP), two with hormone-receptor negative prostate cancer (NRPC) and one with suspected acute myeloid leukemia.

Results

Six had normal PSA levels, three had mildly elevated PSA levels (>1 ng/ml), two had very high levels (<2 ng/ml) and none were BPH or NRPC.

Discussion

None of the cases of prostate cancer was definitively attributed to low levels of PSAs in the serum. None of them had symptoms consistent with BPH or NRPC. Only one had an abnormal PSA level but it was below the upper limit considered indicative of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Conclusion

In conclusion there is no convincing evidence that prostate cancer has a significant relationship with low levels of the PSA test.","n/a; outcome colon cancer\nAnswer: n/a; outcome breast cancer\nAnswer: n/a; outcome colorectal cancer\nAnswer: n/a; outcome lung cancer\nAnswer: n/a; outcome ovary cancer\nAnswer: n/a; outcome pancreatic cancer\nAnswer: n/a; outcome melanoma\nAnswer: n/a; outcome skin cancer\nAnswer: n/a; outcome heart disease\nAnswer: n/a;

Case #1: A 69-year old man presented to our hospital with progressive urinary incontinence. His symptoms were persistent and severe, leading him to see his urologist. On history, the patient reported that for 10 years he had been taking diclofenac as an antiemetic (a medication used to treat nausea). The drug was discontinued by his physician in 2007 because it caused abdominal pain when taken regularly. He took diclofenac daily until 2009 or 2010 before returning to his previous dosage. After 3 months of discontinuation, the patient complained of back pain and began seeking treatment at another hospital center. In January 2011, the patient's physical examination revealed evidence of bladder trauma including a small tear of the bladder wall. Urine output decreased from 8 to 2 ml/day and the patient noted that he felt ""hot"". He continued to take diclofenac without incident. Two weeks later the patient developed a right upper quadrant mass on computed tomography (CT) scan. Biopsies obtained from this mass showed numerous periosteal infiltrates; these were believed to be benign. Subsequent pathology testing identified lymphoid malignancy and carcinoma in situ. On surgical excision of the bladder, two additional masses were discovered, one of which was adenocarcinoma of the left colon (CIN2-3) and the other of bladder dysplasia (BPD). Both of these tumors were resected and biopsy results indicated their presence. All tumors were removed surgically on February 15, 2011. Following surgery, patients urine output increased rapidly while they remained within normal limits. At follow up three months after surgery, urine output was nearly normal except for mild decrease in volume (7 ml/day), similar to what was observed before surgery. Thereafter, on March 16, 2011, urine output remained within normal limits. By June 5, 2011, there appeared to have been no further change in function (physical exam, laboratory analysis) for 6 months after surgery. On June 20, 2011, biopsies were performed for CIN2-3 and BPD. Urine outputs did not change over time despite continuing treatment with diclofenac. One month prior to surgery, the patient said he had started using marijuana to alleviate back and pelvic pain. On May 28, 2011, he purchased marijuana for personal use at a medical dispensary and consumed it the night prior","Yes\ nResult: 0

The final question asked if the patient had received any prior radiation therapy, and included a list of potential reasons for prior therapy. The reason code for ""no"" was unspecified. For each response, we coded the following information (codes were not combined):

1 – no previous radiation treatment,

2 – no previous chemotherapy other than radiotherapy,

3 – no previous surgery (including radiology or surgery),

4 – no previous radiation therapy,

5 – other (e.g., pregnancy).

Statistical analysis

We used Stata software to analyze data from these patients. To control for potential confounding factors related to the study population, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we removed women who reported more frequent follow-up visits; we did not remove women who died before their scheduled follow-up visit, since this would have introduced bias into the results. We then performed univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses to examine whether any prior exposure to ionizing radiation could predict the risk of developing any type of cancers. The incidence rate ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using conditional logistic regression with adjustment for age at diagnosis, body mass index (BMI), education level, smoking status, use of hormone replacement therapy during the previous 3 years, menopausal status, current oral contraceptive use, past oral contraceptives use, parity, total number of live births, and time spent in the highest tertile of pack-years of alcohol intake (P <.05 was considered statistically significant). For all analyses, we calculated P values based on an intention-to-treat principle. A 2-sided P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical tests were two sided.

Results

Of 574 eligible cases, 438 were assigned to this study and 305 completed it. Of these, there were 24 deaths during the first 2 years after enrollment. Among those, 5 developed breast cancer, 7 developed colon cancer, 6 developed thyroid cancer, 1 developed leukemia, and 2 developed nonproliferative lung disease.

[3] This is a summary of the results from the recent studies that compared prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in men with and without prostate cancer to determine whether there are differences between the groups.[4][5] The studies were conducted by researchers at the University of Utah Health Sciences Center using a large sample size, which included over 1,000 subjects from nine countries who received their information via telephone interviews. All the study participants provided written informed consent before completing the study.[6] The findings showed no significant difference in PSA levels among men with or without prostate cancer.[7] In fact, men with prostate cancer had higher PSA levels than those without prostate cancer even though they were more likely to have disease (although this finding was not statistically significant). However, when all the data were pooled together, only men whose PSA level was over 4 ng/ml had a reduced risk of developing prostate cancer. For these men, ""the relative reduction was estimated to be 34%.""[8] These results confirm previous findings showing an association between elevated PSA levels and high rates of prostate cancer, but they also suggest a possible protective effect in men who do not have any evidence of existing disease.[9] [10]","yes

Affected age group

The study population included participants aged ≥75 years (median follow-up 5.1 years) who had a first diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer after October 1, 2001, and completed the study between September 16, 2008, and December 31, 2010. Participants were excluded from this analysis if they had a cancer diagnosed within 2 years prior to enrollment, or had any other history of prostate cancer (except for nonmelanoma skin cancer), diabetes mellitus, or obesity at enrollment (i.e., BMI >30 kg/m2 or <20). We used data on sex, race, body mass index (BMI), education, marital status, smoking status, and alcohol consumption collected from self-report questionnaire (SQ) to estimate total energy intake. Self-reported intakes were adjusted using the diet-history method, which includes a weighting factor that adjusts for food preparation and eating behaviors.13 The distribution of energy intake among participants was similar across strata defined by educational level (<High school graduate; High school graduate; some college graduate; college graduate); sex; race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, Mexican American; Hispanic, non-Hispanic black; African American); and BMI (<25 kg/m2; 25–29.9 kg/m2; 30–34.9 kg/m2; 35–39.9 kg/m2; ≥40 kg/m2); however, individuals with a higher BMI had an elevated risk of death compared to those with lower BMIs.14 For each individual in our cohort, we calculated the percentage of calories consumed from fat (excluding saturated fatty acids and trans fats), protein, carbohydrate, and fiber intake using nutrient database information available through the National Cancer Institute's National Center for Health Statistics' Web-based Epidemiologic Information System for Diet Study Data.15

Statistical Analysis

We estimated the association between total energy intake and all-cause mortality in our cohort using Cox proportional hazards regression models.16 First, we determined the incidence rate ratio (IRR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) with 95% CIs (for men) and 100% CIs (for women) comparing the highest versus lowest quintile of total energy intake. Next, we stratified analyses by baseline physical activity by using the results from a validated health examination survey in 1997 (the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) that examined leisure time physical activities, which include walking and swimming as well as active transportation ("

Question: How long do you expect the treatment to last? Answer: The treatment lasts for 2 years from start to finish. There are two periods during which the therapy is active. During the first period (6 months) there may be a reduction in tumour size, but it will not necessarily go away completely. If this occurs, the second phase begins and is designed to increase survival rates by targeting secondary or distant malignancies. This phase of therapy has also shown promise as an alternative to surgery. In the case of CML, the drug can target both primary tumours at once, allowing for more rapid and effective clearance of the disease than if only one type of tumour was targeted (see above).

Other aspects of the study

This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded trial that assessed all available therapies against chemotherapy alone with the aim of achieving better outcomes.

The investigators studied four groups:

Group 1 - Treatment as usual (taken after diagnosis of melanoma), followed by standard doses of pomalidomide (60 mg/day, divided into three daily doses).

Group 2 - Treatment as usual (taken before diagnosis of melanoma), followed by standard doses of pomalidomide (60 mg/day, divided into two daily doses).

Group 3 - POMILANDOMIDE plus radiation therapy (pomalidomide + radiotherapy);

group 4 - POMILANDOMIDE plus standard doses of pomalidomide (60 mg/day, divided into three daily doses).

All participants had their tumors removed. They were monitored until they were no longer experiencing any symptoms associated with early stages of cancer.

When analysing results for overall survival, no significant difference between group 1 and group 4 was found. However, when looking specifically at overall survival with progression-free survival (PFS), treatment with pomalidomide plus radiation therapy was significantly better than treatment with standard doses of pomalidomide. In comparison, a statistically insignificant difference was noted between treatment with radiation therapy alone and therapy with pomalidomide + radiotherapy.

In total, 1048 people participated in this trial. Of these, 1027 completed treatment. Overall, 810 people survived the course of treatment, including five who died of other causes within 12 weeks (one of whom was on pomalidomide). Two","Stage 4

Stage 4 metastasis is defined as the presence of a nodal mass or adenocarcinoma that has spread to distant areas in either the upper thoracic cavity or lung. These tumors are found at the time of diagnosis (stage 1) and continue to grow for up to 5 years after diagnosis (stage 2). They then go into remission, but may return later if not treated with radiation therapy. This type of disease usually occurs when cells become resistant to chemotherapy, even at lower doses. The risk of developing this disease increases significantly as people age because they are more likely than younger patients to develop resistance.

When to see your doctor?

If you have had some symptoms, such as coughing or difficulty breathing, or if you've noticed changes in your health during the past year, contact your doctor right away if you notice any problems with your lungs that might be related to lung cancer. For instance, some cancers can affect other organs, such as the bones, liver or kidneys. A doctor should also check to make sure you don't have other conditions that could cause similar symptoms.

How will I know my condition has advanced?

Your doctor will probably begin to treat your lung cancer by doing tests to find out how far along it is. Some doctors use X-rays to measure the size and shape of your lung tissue. If your cancer has grown so much that a needle is inserted through the skin into your chest wall, you'll need to get an x-ray of your lungs every few months until your condition improves. You may receive a CT scan or MRI scans to look at your lungs' structure and function.

Stage 5 metastatic lung cancer outcomes\nAnswer: yes

A study involving 13,895 patients who underwent surgery for advanced cancer at 12 centers in the United States and Canada reported that when compared with a group of patients without lung cancer, those treated with pembrolizumab had lower rates of death from all causes, other cancers combined (except non-Hodgkin lymphoma), respiratory disease (except asthma) or malignant neoplasms, as well as an increased likelihood of achieving remission. In addition, pembrolizumab was associated with reduced time to relapse. A second phase III trial will investigate whether pembrolizumab is also effective in patients who have failed standard therapy.

Q5-6: Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer outcome\nAnswer: Not applicable.

Risk Factors and Chemotherapy: Cancer is considered to be a disease that arises from the cells of the body, and cancer treatments are directed towards killing the tumor cells in order to cure the patient. However, cancer can arise from any part of the body. It does not matter how old a person is, they may develop or progress to develop cancer later on in life. The following factors have been identified as the most common risk factors for developing cancer: Family history of certain types of cancers: A family history includes all members who have had one or more of their relatives (parents, siblings) die of cancer at some point in time. One of the most important genetic features of cancer is the inheritance of specific gene mutations which can lead to development of particular forms of tumors. This means that certain genes are passed down through generations. While it's not possible to say with certainty whether a woman will get a breast cancer when she is older than 45 years of age, there is little doubt that women younger than this age carry increased risks of developing breast cancer due to inherited genes. Smoking causes breast cancer: In the United States, smoking has long been associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer in women; however, many studies over the last few decades suggest that the link between smoking and breast cancer risk is weaker than previously thought. A number of environmental factors such as physical activity, diet, exposure to sunlight, hormones, and various other lifestyle factors are now being investigated in the search of possible explanations for why people smoke and what impact these factors may have on breast cancer rates. Researchers continue to study these complex issues in an attempt to better understand the relationship between cigarette smoking and breast cancer incidence. Risk factors for prostate cancer include: History of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): If you've ever had BPH, chances are good that your genetics predisposes you to developing prostate cancer by way of the same mechanisms that cause BPH. Men who have undergone surgery to remove a bony mass called a prostate gland, also known as a prostatic adenocarcinoma (PAD), have a higher chance of developing prostate cancer because the removal of PADs results in inflammation within the prostate itself. There are several different ways that inflammation can occur in the prostate leading to cancer formation. Research shows that inflammatory cytokines in the blood stream stimulate growth of normal prostate cells while inhibiting growth of abnormal prostate cells.","yes

The results showed that the number of patients with high-grade disease (5+ lesions) was increased in both groups, while the numbers of patients with low-grade disease remained constant between the two groups. However, there were significant differences between the two study groups, as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. The mean survival time for these patients who did not receive chemotherapy was 20 weeks in the group receiving CIMT and 21 weeks in the group treated with radiation alone. Those who received a combination of radiotherapy plus CT after initial treatment had a shorter survival than those who received only one therapy. This may be because the combination of treatment modalities can improve the overall prognosis of the patient. Additionally, the researchers believe it is possible that the use of CT in conjunction with chemotherapy has been shown to reduce tumor burden by increasing cell turnover and decreasing apoptosis. These findings suggest that combining the treatment modality could increase tumor regression rates which would likely lead to better overall outcomes. A large randomized trial to determine whether this strategy actually leads to improved outcomes is needed.

Dr. Robert Wagers, Director of Clinical Trials at Dana Farber Cancer Institute said: ""We are very pleased to have found an innovative and potentially game changing approach to treating advanced nonmetastatic breast cancer using two different chemotherapies.""

In total, 30 men and women underwent radiation and/or chemotherapy combined with PET scans at least once every 6 months. All participants received standard care including adjuvant medical care and surgery. Patients were followed up until death or December 31, 2010. The majority of the patients developed early-stage breast tumors which were localized within the breasts. In addition, 7% of the subjects experienced high grade disease and 25% of the subjects developed late-stage disease. There were no deaths from cancer during the 8 years of followup. Overall, 80% of the patients responded to either the radiation or chemotherapy treatments, but most responses occurred within 3 years following completion of treatment. Of the 10 patients who died, all were experiencing late-stage disease at the time they died.

This study found that patients who received two cycles of high dose temozolomide plus gemcitabine were more likely to respond than those treated only with gemcitabine. The response rate was 76 percent versus 44 percent among patients receiving one cycle of treatment.

The authors say this may be due to the ""significantly higher doses of temozolomide."" For example, temozolomide can cause systemic hypotension, which could lead to reduced survival. In addition, the researchers note that while it has been shown that gemcitabine alone does not improve overall survival compared with the combination of temozolomide and gemcitabine, the two therapies do appear to be effective when used together.

In another large randomized trial comparing two different combinations of temozolomide and gemcitabine (no chemotherapy), patients receiving both temozolomide and gemcitabine had a significantly better survival rate (95 percent CI [95% CI] 1.19 to 1.34 vs 93.5 percent CI [93.7-94.8 percent]) compared to patients treated with one or the other drug alone."

This is a common type of invasive cancer that often occurs in older women, and is more likely to be found after an early mammogram. The most common symptom of this disease involves the breasts (breasts that are hard or painful). Your doctor may advise you to take some time off work until your symptoms improve. If you have any concerns about how you look, talk with your doctor or healthcare provider before taking time off from work.

Q. What is the prognosis for the patient?

A. The outlook varies depending on factors including age, type of disease and clinical course. Generally speaking, chemotherapy has a good prognosis. However, because many patients experience relapse after treatment, it is important to follow-up with a biopsy if the tumor remains at least 3 mm in diameter (about 1 inch). For this reason, doctors recommend that all survivors who have been treated with cytotoxic therapy should be followed up by a mammogram every three years.


For those patients whose tumors remain undetected or small at diagnosis, surgical resection may be considered. A study conducted by the American Society of Clinical Oncology found that surgery could provide an additional 10% reduction in overall survival compared to chemotherapy alone. Surgery may be possible if there are complications associated with chemotherapy, such as infection, bleeding, scarring, or other problems. In addition, some experts believe that early staging procedures can improve outcome. Staging, also called initial response to therapy, involves measuring how well a patient responds to treatment before any treatment is started. This means using a combination of laboratory tests to monitor the body's immune system, blood pressure, weight, liver function, and other organ functions; evaluating blood and tissue samples from the abdomen; and examining the prostate gland, bladder, and bowel to determine whether they show signs of disease. This information helps doctors make better decisions about when and how to begin treatment, which ultimately will increase the likelihood that a patient will respond.

Some patients also require more intensive treatments in order to fight the cancer. These include radiation therapy or even stem cell transplantation. According to the National Cancer Institute, most people who undergo these types of therapies live longer than those who don't receive them.

In terms of future treatment options, both immunotherapy drugs and targeted therapeutics are becoming more common in cancer care. Immunotherapy involves trying to block the effects of certain proteins produced by cancer cells. Targeted therapies, on the other hand, target specific cancer cells through a series of different chemicals.

When choosing between chemo and immunotherapy, take into account your individual circumstances, medical needs, and financial situation. Talk to your doctor about whether chemotherapy is right for you.

Interviewer: question, what was your initial response to the diagnosis of leukemia?

Medical student: I think it is the worst news that we ever receive. We had no idea that this was possible for us at such a young age.

Medical Student: The news did not come as a surprise for me, but seeing a patient have such a serious problem in his body, and being the first time you are dealing with it yourself makes it that much more difficult. Even though there was so little information available on the subject, we knew that it could happen to any child.

Mental health students: We were shocked by the news of our classmate having leukemia. It surprised us because he had been doing so well up until then, and we thought maybe the leukemia just went away on its own. Now we know better.

Medical Student: I'm also surprised how quickly the cancer came back after his bone marrow transplant. He has been treated so well in the past two years through chemo and stem cell treatments. This time around, we're concerned about the treatment he will be receiving now since he cannot donate his bone marrow. We want him to get better before he can donate his bone marrow, which would help many other children with cancers like his in the future.

Interviewer: what do you remember most from that day?

Medical Student: At that moment, I felt as if everything in my life was over. The doctors told us that we had one week to decide whether we wanted to continue chemotherapy. I asked myself why they needed to tell us what to do at the last minute when it seemed like something that I'd already decided on.

Q: What is the difference between: breast cancer and other types of colorectal neoplasms?A: There are two main kinds of colorectal cancers: primary (non-melanoma) and metastatic. Primary tumors arise from a person's own cells. They do not usually spread to nearby tissue, including distant lymph nodes or organs such as the liver or lungs.Mastectomy for these tumors reduces their ability to grow quickly enough to affect the surrounding organs, causing death within several months.Mastectomies often must be performed before cancer can spread, which typically occurs at least six months after surgery. Secondary tumors may occur in people who have had only one tumor removed.Colonoscopy uses light microscopes to look inside the colon. The operation involves passing small instruments through the rectum to examine the lining of the colon. Colonic polyps, benign growths that appear as bumps on the surface of the bowel, can cause symptoms similar to those caused by cancer. These benign growths can also lead to serious complications if they reach larger areas of your body, especially in older patients.Treatments for these conditions include radiation therapy and chemotherapy.Radiation therapy used to treat colorectal cancer produces high doses of radiation that target both normal and abnormal cells throughout the colon and large intestine. Antineoplastons, such as Aricept (mepacitinib), are sometimes given along with radiotherapy to help fight cancerous growths. Chemotherapy medications may be used too. In addition, some studies suggest that colon cancer may respond better to immune system therapies such as stem cells than chemotherapy alone.Some patients experience side effects while undergoing surgery to remove part of their colon, called a ""transversus"" procedure. This type of procedure requires that your doctor carefully inspect your entire colon. Other procedures such as a ""colonoscopic resection"" may require less extensive inspection. Talk to your doctor about any risks you might face during the procedure.","yes

The following questions are for people with stage 3 or 4 breast cancer. All these diseases can be cured but only if your disease is caught early. The treatments have different characteristics that will affect each person.

Question: What does the average age of someone who receives chemotherapy and radiation therapy for stage III breast cancer? Answer: 70 years, on average.

Question: What is the risk that a patient who has undergone breast cancer treatment will develop dementia during the next 10-20 years? If I am diagnosed with stage III breast cancer and receive chemotherapy and radiotherapy, will I experience any side effects? (Please answer in 1-5 points) Answer: There is no evidence that patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy have an increased incidence of dementia.

Question: Is it more common to see other symptoms in patients undergoing cancer treatment compared to those receiving usual care? Answer: Yes, many patients have other problems related to their diagnosis such as depression, anxiety, irritability, lack of concentration, poor sleep quality, and more.

Question: Are there any risks associated with having a pacemaker fitted after breast cancer treatment? Answer: Not likely, except possibly increased sensitivity to electric shocks.

Question: Which is better - surgery or chemotherapy? Answer: Surgery should be preferred because it allows you to get the best possible outcome. Chemotherapy may also benefit some women, however, it is not always effective so it must be weighed up against the potential long term medical complications.

The Cancer Treatment Experts Association recently updated its guidelines for treating triple positive breast cancer. In an effort to provide more information about these options, I asked the experts what happened to her.

Stage 1 - No Cancer

This is the first time that a patient has been diagnosed with stage I breast cancer. Patients may have different symptoms and/or more advanced disease than those found in women who have undergone surgery for early stage breast cancers. A complete history will be taken, including any previous medical problems or family histories of breast cancer. The results from blood tests can then be obtained to see if there are any pre-cancerous changes. If a positive test result is observed at this stage, the surgeon will decide whether surgery should be performed.

If the breast biopsy shows no pre-cancerous changes, treatment usually consists of chemotherapy (chemo) and radiation therapy (radiation). Breast cancer patients are typically treated for 6 months after diagnosis. Treatment duration varies depending on the type of breast cancer and how far along it was discovered. It's also important to know that some tumors cannot be removed without significant complications that could lead to death. For example, non-invasive benign nodules are often left untreated as they require very little effort to remove. Many other types of tumors can only be removed surgically.

Treatment can be divided into two stages: early detection and late detection. Early detection occurs before cancer cells spread beyond the breast area. Late detection is when an overabundance of tumor cells causes severe harm to nearby tissues. Radiation therapy is often required in order to kill these dangerous cancer cells which may not be detected until later stages of the disease.

In early detection, the treatments used most frequently include chemo, hormonal therapy, tamoxifen and hormone replacement therapies. In the second stage, chemotherapy is given to destroy all cancer cells and prevent them from spreading further. Some cases are cured by surgical removal of a large portion of the tumors. If treatment fails to eliminate the growths completely, radiation therapy may be considered.

Stage 3 Breast Cancer

Q: I had breast cancer in stage three. What is the likelihood of my surviving and living long enough to have a baby? Answer: about 5% probability (5-10%)

Stage 2 Breast Cancer

Q: I had breast cancer in stage two. How long will it take before I can start chemotherapy? Answer: it depends on how quickly you recover from your cancer. It may take up to 6 months after diagnosis for your symptoms to subside, so your treatment could be delayed. But you should still schedule an appointment with your doctor soon after you begin treatment so that they can monitor you closely.

Stage 1 Breast Cancer

The numbers given below are estimates based upon research studies of breast cancers survivors published over the past several decades. The numbers shown for the most common kinds of breast cancer are averages which do not apply to every survivor. Your chance of survival at any one year from the time of diagnosis depends greatly on the type of cancer you have and whether or not you started screening early. Some survivors have died within a few years after being diagnosed.

question: what are the main signs of heart arrhythmia?

Answer: chest discomfort, slow pulse and blood pressure dropping.

Question: What is the cause of migraine headaches?

Answer: The cause of migraine headaches is a combination of factors such as genetic, hormonal, environmental, and psychological factors. Migraine sufferers who have been diagnosed with this disease often report that their symptoms started sometime in childhood or early adolescence, while they were still teenagers. They described how they used to get migraines on certain days when their teachers would make fun of them at school. For instance, they would feel very bad when their teachers asked them questions such as ""are you having your period today?"" This made it difficult for the sufferer to study and concentrate during school time. Some sufferers also reported feeling more intense during sex. They claimed that these feelings were similar to the ones that some people get when they have an orgasm. As a result of experiencing the headaches at such times, a person could suffer from the following problems.

1. Depression 2. Anxiety 3. Trouble sleeping 4. Feeling restless 5. Difficulty concentrating 6. Muscle tension 7. Headaches 8. Insomnia 9. Restlessness 10. Dizziness 11. Sleep disturbances 12.

In this video we'll share some tips about the advantages of CBT to get relief quickly. We've also included a great chart that illustrates what happens during CBT sessions and how they affect your headaches in just 5 minutes or less.

Does CBT Really Work?

So, you're wondering if it really works and can help you beat those bad head aches. While there isn't any research on the effectiveness of CBT (which is pretty rare), the evidence suggests that it does work. Many studies suggest that CBT is effective at reducing symptoms of acute migraine, tension-type headache, cluster headaches, migraines due to anxiety, and other types of chronic pain as shown here in a review by Fournier et al.

How Much Does CBT Cost?

The cost depends on how much you want to spend but typically costs between $100-$200 per session depending on what kind of treatment you choose. And remember – all your money goes toward helping yourself, not hurting others! The average price for one therapy session ranges from around $30-$60 which is quite reasonable considering the potential benefits of CBT for pain, sleep, and mood.

When Should My Headache Start To Get Better?

Once your pain starts to get better after taking CBT, it usually begins to subside within a few weeks to several months. Sometimes however, your headaches may continue throughout the whole","yes

This is the top question that I get asked. But there are multiple answers to this and some of them may surprise you. This is because it's a very complicated topic, but for now let's just focus on one answer, which we've discussed in our previous article, The Best Pillow Neck Pain Treatment Guide.

The answer is to avoid hard objects, such as books, magazines or your laptop, at all times when sleeping. There are two reasons why this works; firstly by preventing pressure build-up inside the cervical spine, secondly by restricting blood flow to the spinal cord.

Let's look at each point in detail.

1. Avoid Hard Objects

You might think that avoiding hard objects during sleep will be a waste of time – they'll probably do more harm than good. If they cause any damage then your headache will probably become worse as well as the risk of developing postural headaches (the same headache you would have if you were lying down). So why bother?

Well you can actually prevent headaches and migraines from happening.

In order to find out whether soft tissue injuries caused by sleeping on hard surfaces such as pillows has an effect on headache severity, researchers carried out three studies with over 600 participants. All subjects were healthy young men and women who did not suffer from any neurological conditions that could affect their ability to perform routine tasks. The tests involved measuring the number of pressure points recorded and also assessing patients' general health, symptoms of fatigue, and psychological factors like anxiety. Participants had their head measured using an interventional device that measures pressure points and brain activity.

Results showed that the number of pressure points increased significantly after waking up, so the authors concluded that pressure points increase the risk of headache for everyone. They also found that having lower total and pressure pain scores was associated with higher migraine prevalence. Additionally, people who reported feeling tired before bed had more headache pain compared with those who felt no need to rest.

So even though these results show that pressure points causes headaches, most people still don't want to avoid sleeping on hard surfaces – many of us use pillows for comfort rather than protection against injury.

2. Restrict Blood Flow To Spinal Cord

One common reason why people report headaches while sleeping is the restriction of blood circulation to the part of the body called the spinal cord, called lumbar vertebrae.

A small study done in Japan by researchers from Nara University of Medicine and Science in Japan","The first question that comes to mind is probably the most common and has been asked thousands of times by people around the world. In fact, it's so common that many of you will have experienced this as well. You are asleep and suddenly find yourself with a terrible, stabbing, burning or ache in your neck. You know what's going on because you've felt it before – the ""neck pain"" you feel when your head turns and you can't move it! And yet it doesn't go away no matter how hard you try to loosen up your muscles and relax them. It feels like someone is twisting a knife into your neck. I'd say 95% of people who experience neck pain report it starts with some type of tightness in their neck (e.g., neck rolls) but eventually turns into something more severe such as pain that radiates through the whole body. So why do we tend to fall for these ""neck pain"" stories? Many factors contribute to how our brains create these perceptions about our own bodies. But one factor that plays an important role is our sense of smell.


What causes neck pain?

As mentioned above, the reason our necks hurt seems to be linked to our ability to breathe while we sleep. Our airways become constricted and we then start to inhale, pushing food and other items down deeper into our lungs. This can cause pressure within the chest cavity (known as pneumothorax), which is characterized by deep breathing. The result is increased blood loss and sometimes even death. Of course, this isn't always caused by breathlessness and we often think it happens just after we wake up from sleeping. However, we know that the problem is much worse than just having trouble breathing during sleep, especially if we also suffer chronic low back pain.

How does this happen? First, let's take a look at how our brain perceives the sensation of breathing and the airway. As you're lying there, your entire body is completely relaxed. Your face might seem slightly flushed, and your heart rate may be somewhere between 100-120 beats per minute. Breathing itself may actually be quite pleasant and rhythmic, but the way our brains interpret this sensation of relaxation depends upon whether our senses are active or not. If we can see another person in an empty room, they are almost certainly alive and therefore appear awake. When we watch TV or listen to music, we cannot tell whether someone is sleeping or awake and we therefore assume they are still breathing normally.","Best pillows neck pain is caused by some kind of injury (usually a blow to the head) and most likely happens when you wake up from deep sleep. It may also happen if your spine has been injured and you have not seen a doctor about it, or if you are sleeping on an uneven surface. Usually this type of pain will be very mild but can lead to permanent damage to your soft tissue. If your pillow neck hurts for more than 6 months you should see a doctor immediately.

Why do I need a pillow neck specialist?

A pillow neck specialist ensures that your pillow neck problem is diagnosed correctly, and then treated with proper therapy which leads to its complete resolution and prevents any future problems from developing. They perform their work by looking at all possible causes of pillow neck pain and taking into consideration their clinical findings. The team uses their knowledge of pillow neck anatomy and how muscles work in order to identify potential causes of the condition.

It's important for patients who suffer from pillow neck pain to seek professional advice as soon as they begin experiencing discomfort. As well as providing them with accurate diagnosis and treatment, they're there to support their recovery and help them manage symptoms during the initial stages. A pillow neck specialist ensures that all relevant tests are conducted before treatment begins to ensure that you don't end up having further complications after starting treatment.","it has to be one that is made of cotton, which I think you can find at the fabric store.

Q. What do you use for your bath?\nAnswer: It depends on what time of day it is and if there are any allergies or sensitivities. For example, I only bath in the shower and not in a tub. Also, I only take my shampoo with me while I bathe as they might irritate my scalp. If I have a sensitive scalp then I go straight from the shower into the bath water. But if I'm feeling really good about myself, I like to splash around a little bit with just an aerosol spray bottle, like with my hair dryer.

If there's no allergy or sensitivity, I'll stick to using hot water and plain soap for bathing. In fact, I've never used a shampoo because I don't want anything irritating my skin.

Q. How long does it take you to feel better after having an operation?\nAnswer: Usually within 24 hours. After going home and letting my body heal for a few days, I usually wake up feeling much more rested than I did before the procedure.

My husband sometimes finds my skin a little sore for a couple of days after surgery but he hasn't had any problems with his own skin since we met. My doctor says that it takes anywhere between two and four weeks for your skin to get back to normal. And most people end up doing their hair right after having an operation so I know that will be easy for him!

Q. Can you tell us a bit about your recovery process?\nAnswer: I try to spend as much time as possible with my family and friends during this period because I need them to help keep me motivated. The hardest part isn't getting out of bed, but rather being able to eat and drink normally again without all those extra chemicals trying to destroy my health.

I also start taking vitamins such as Vitamin C, B12, iodine, folic acid (for pregnant women) and calcium once a week. These supplements provide a lot of nutrients and minerals and help strengthen my immune system so it won't react so badly when there's a reaction later on.

The hardest thing is waiting to see how my scar heals, but I know it will be done quickly. This time of year I feel particularly tired so I try to give myself some rest every night.

Q. Do you ever miss sex?\nAnswer:","Pain from a tight or bunched-up collarbone.

What is the difference between a collar bone and a collar joint? A collar bone is an extension of the shoulder blade (shoulder socket). It's located directly above the elbow, behind the rib cage. The shoulder joint is found at the junction of the clavicle and scapula bones; it connects to the upper arm bone.

A collar joint is not part of your shoulder but rather is a location that forms when the humerus moves in relation to the hip joint. In most people, this movement happens through the ball of the foot.

Pain from a collar bone occurs because the shoulder has moved too far forward during a flexion phase of the exercise. Because this movement does not occur naturally, you have to consciously create it by holding the weight or using a resistance band for example. In addition, you must be careful not to overstretch the shoulders, which can cause them to become injured as well.

How do I know if my shoulder is a collar bone? If your collar bone feels painful, this may indicate that there is something wrong with your shoulder joint.

Do not rest your arm on a bench! This is just another way of asking yourself if you really need to lift weights to lose weight. And don't think about doing any dumbbell exercises either. Dumbbells will not help you lose fat, and they are very effective at building strength only in short bursts – 10 reps in the gym is all they'll ever need.

What should I do instead? Exercise with a heavy object such as barbell, dumbbell, medicine ball or kettle bell. Also, use resistance bands or weight plates to increase the challenge.

Do not try to stretch your neck after you've finished lifting. Do NOT bend your head sideways while bending over to reach around for something. You will put undue stress on the cervical spine and could damage the discs of the L1 vertebrae. Instead, lean back slightly until your hands touch the floor. You will feel the muscles of your neck contracting, and this helps relax the tension on the disc.","I'm not sure. My wife has had it for a long time. She thinks she's an empath or something, but maybe her pain is due to how it feels in the head.

My favorite comfort product for my pillow neck is this pillow from Pillow Factory. The ""sleep on me"" feature makes it easy to put it into your pillows and place them over your face when you want to sleep like a baby. It also doesn't make any noise, so no one can hear you snoring.

Worst Comfort Product: The NaturaFlex Sleeve (it was the worst when I first tried it) – my wife loves it! But she got tired of it after a few months, and now it's too small for her hands and her wrists. I think her neck/head just hurts because her back muscles are constantly contracting. When they stop contracting, they start hurting again!

I try to buy things that don't bother her at all.

Question: what's the most annoying thing about being married? Answer: She gets very emotional easily…so much so that she will scream and yell if I don't get up in 10 minutes. This usually happens at night where we're both asleep together as well.

One day she said she felt like crying and threw herself across the bed in despair. We had to call 911 and took her to the hospital, where she needed stitches and some other stuff. I had to go and help her because she couldn't walk properly.

The next morning when we woke up, there were two broken glasses and lots of blood everywhere. At home she kept asking me why we hadn't gotten up yet.

There have been times when she screamed for hours (because she didn't feel better), even though I slept through most of it. On another occasion, she yelled so loud that a neighbor came running down the stairs and asked us what was going on.

As far as annoyances go, it'd be hard to top the ""I hate my husband"" issue. I'll always wonder what happened when he didn't show up to work that day. And then I realize, maybe he left his car unlocked, which caused him to run out of gas …and then he crashed his motorcycle. All I could do was laugh. He wouldn't understand.

When she started talking about wanting more sex with our son, I immediately thought about the time when our daughter tried to give him oral pleasure, but I interrupted","A. I am a very long sleeper who needs to be able to sleep for 24 hours and not have the arms and legs up all night.

Q: best pillow neck pain\nAnswer: C, D, E. If you can't get rid of your shoulder pain, try one or two of these.

Treatment of Neck Pain

If you want to reduce the pain that's plaguing you, it is important to take care of your body properly. There are many ways to treat backache including chiropractic treatment, massage therapy, acupuncture, exercise, homeopathy, etc.

The only thing that really works for me in relieving my neck pain is the use of cold compress on my neck every single day. When I feel like it, I will put some heat around it which helps as well!

There are some things you must do if you have neck pain. Take breaks from using the computer and phones and make sure you're at home when you're taking a break. Relaxing with a good book will also help tremendously!

I think that neck pain is something you need to deal with as soon as possible and not let it linger any longer than needed because then your head will start hurting too much. This will cause headaches and even migraines but they won't last for more than a few days. The pain will eventually go away once you realize how bad it is getting.

It was never supposed to happen this way though…you just wake up one morning after having no pain for weeks. It may seem weird at first but we've been through a lot together and it is time we move forward."

Q. my child has eczema, can he take Sertraline?

A. NO! SERTRALINE CAN CAUSE LESION AND REPRODUCTIVE HARM TO CHILDREN (MALE OR FEMALE). There are many other drugs that have been FDA approved to help children with this condition. The risks of SERTRALINE outweigh the benefits for most children. Please see ""Sertraline Side Effects"" on this web page for a complete list of Sertraline side effects and warnings.

Q. I'm taking Sertraline and my child is also getting it. Will they get any reactions from each other?

A. Yes! Sertraline has an effect on some people's nervous system when taken together. If your child takes both Sertraline and one or more antihistamines, it is very important that you discuss their use in detail as Sertraline may interfere with the action of these medications.

Q. My child was prescribed a different type of medication called Demerol (Dramamine) for his ADHD. Do I need to stop taking Sertraline too?

A. Most people who take Sertraline will not experience adverse effects if they stop taking the drug too quickly. However, you should check your pediatrician for information about how long it takes your child to stop taking Sertraline and then make sure you continue to be monitored closely until there is no longer any sign of improvement.

Q. What happens if someone stops using Sertraline suddenly?

A. Sertraline comes in tablet form and is usually taken by mouth with food. Your doctor may give you a prescription for a chewable tablet called Adzenys XR-ODT which is not available over the counter. It has similar properties as Sertraline but does not come in tablet form and must be swallowed whole.

If you lose contact with your child and no longer have access to the tablets, you may wish to start a new treatment regimen using an alternative antipsychotic. When prescribing Adzenys XR-ODT, your pediatrician or pharmacist may suggest you try a lower dose such as 10 mg once daily as opposed to 20 mg twice daily. This may work better for your child and reduce the risk of becoming drowsy or having problems concentrating. See ""Possible Drug Interactions"" section below for more","no

Pain and Functioning

Question: is the pain from a joint problem?

Answer: yes

Question: what is your current level of function?

Answer: functional

Question: how well do you feel in your body at this time?

Answer: very good

Question: is there any swelling or redness at your site(s) that needs to be checked out by an orthopedist? (e.g., a torn ligament, bone spurs).

Answer: Yes

What to Expect if You Have Arthritis Pain","no answer

Q: swelling of fingers and toes (especially thumb) in the first week after a fever. (answer given by doctor, October 2003)

A: I believe this is probably due to an increase in lymphatic flow from a virus or bacterial infection. The problem can be treated with antibiotics if it persists for more than two weeks.

Hands and Feet

Q: My right hand hurts all over, not just on the ends. It's hard to open a bottle. How long should I wait before going to the Doctor?

A: This condition is often caused by either inflammation in the area or an infection. If you have been experiencing these symptoms for over two weeks they may indicate that your body is fighting an internal enemy - most likely a fungus. It is important not to go to see the doctor until you've had four consecutive days without any pain. You should also get some rest as well as eating a healthy diet and getting plenty of fluids. Once the soreness goes away the doctor will be able to determine what was wrong. There are several different types of fungi. One type causes sores, another produces pus-filled swellings called boils. Often both types affect the same part of the body. Some people are prone to one disease while others are susceptible to many. It has been found that the incidence of finger infections tends to rise with age so older individuals tend to have higher rates. Other factors that contribute to increased risk include being overweight or having certain lifestyle habits like smoking tobacco or alcohol use.

Tears or Blisters

Q: When does a blister form under my fingernails? Is there anything that can help prevent them from forming?

A: A blister forms when microscopic bacteria (viruses) enter a tissue cell through a puncture site. They travel along the inner surface of skin cells and attach themselves to nearby blood vessels. As the blood vessel wall thickens the capillaries become blocked, causing a ""bleeding"" sensation. This process occurs rapidly, creating an air pocket around the blister which creates an environment conducive for infection.

The best way to avoid blisters developing is to keep your nails trimmed short. Frequent washing will keep them smooth and free from infection. To reduce the risk of a blister forming you should cut down your intake of salt.

It is best to seek immediate medical attention if a blister develops, or if it keeps opening up again within 24 hours. If it becomes infected, treatment consists of antibiotic","Pain, swelling, and stiffness in the hands.

Possible symptoms include burning when touching objects, or a ""pins-and-needles"" sensation.

Painful joints can cause difficulty in moving your arms and legs or even giving birth.

It's important to keep treating these conditions with pain medication and rest!


How do I know if my problem is rheumatoid arthritis?

If you have any of the following symptoms, then it could be rheumatoid arthritis:

a lot of joint inflammation (redness or warmth) that doesn't go away;

severe pain that has been present for more than 2 weeks (often severe);

pain on urinating, especially after having sex; or

pain at other times of the day or night.

Also, if you feel tired a lot, dizzy, or have trouble sleeping, it may be an indication of this condition. Some people who are diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis also experience an autoimmune disease, which means their bodies attack normal tissues they don't recognize as being from themselves. The immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissue in response to something it perceives as invading its body.

Q: skin rash\nAnswer: rarely seen unless you're allergic or have had a reaction to certain supplements

Q: red blotches on hands\nAnswer: usually from sweating, especially after exercising

Q: burning stomach\nAnswer: very common among endurance athletes - probably caused by dehydration due to sweat loss during exercise. Sometimes when the body doesn't get enough water through the sweat it turns into a water retention problem and can be life threatening. Drink plenty of fluids and eat healthy foods before and during training for maximum hydration!

Q: cramping\nAnswer: usually due to lack of sodium in the blood, which causes electrolyte imbalance

Q: nausea\nAnswer: probably caused by salt intake in large amounts, especially during prolonged periods

Q: heartburn\nAnswer: sometimes. a small amount of salt helps relax your colon so that things can pass easily

Q: headache\nAnswer: most likely due to stress or anxiety. Exercise increases adrenaline and produces more cortisol, which may cause headaches; also keep in mind that caffeine has similar effects to caffeine in stimulating the adrenal glands and causing headaches; but unlike caffeine it does not produce drowsiness

Q: indigestion\nAnswer: depends on the type of food and how much fiber you consume. If you drink lots of sweetened beverages and eat fruits and vegetables you won't suffer this problem

Q: constipation\nAnswer: can be caused by many factors, including diarrhea, diet, lack of fiber and/or digestive enzymes, hormone imbalances, etc. You should consult","The answer is yes.

Q: I have had my arms and legs cut off. Can I still get the acupuncture treatment?

A: The general consensus is that no, if the area has been severely damaged, then it's not appropriate for acupuncture. If your injury or surgery didn't involve cutting out much skin (like with open-heart surgery) then yes, you can get acupuncture. This depends on how badly your acupuncture practitioner has messed up. But just be very careful about taking up too much time in the clinic, because there are more patients than there are practitioners!","It will be painless. The pain is probably a result of the nerves controlling your fingertips going through the nerve block, and then back out again because of the increased pressure on the nerve blocks that are blocking them in the first place.

Pain can be relieved with over-the-counter acetaminophen or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) or using a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as naproxen sodium. A muscle relaxant might also help. If it does not ease the pain, try another medicine for your condition, such as aspirin or an NSAID. Your doctor may give you medication to make it less painful. Tell your doctor if your symptoms get worse.","A. The nerve supply to the hand is inadequate, causing a numbness in the affected area.

Q: What does it mean when someone says they are ""allergic"" to a certain medicine?A. It means that there may be an allergic reaction or other adverse effect (such as skin irritation, redness, itching and/or rashes). If you have any of these reactions when taking your medication, stop taking it for at least one week. Symptoms will usually go away on their own within about 3 days if the allergic reaction has been prevented from occurring.

Please click here to learn more about what causes allergies


Q: Why do I get tired easily?

A: This can happen because your body uses oxygen less efficiently than usual. When you exercise, your muscles use up some of this stored energy. As a result, your brain can't produce enough needed glucose and your body goes into overdrive producing extra sugar. In addition, your kidneys lose water as well. With little available space in your cells, it becomes harder and harder for them to function properly. You become tired and feel unwell!","I have had some arthritis for a long time, so it's an ongoing thing.

A4) I'm 5'7"" and 145 pounds.

Q5) How old were you when you started doing CrossFit? And how many years did you do CrossFit before starting to work with us?

A5) After playing football all through high school, I was injured while playing lacrosse at Texas Tech University. It took me another 2-1/2 years to recover from this injury. Finally, after going on hiatus from college sports, I found out about CrossFit by chance one day while browsing Reddit and Bodybuilding.com. At first I wasn't sure whether or not I should try it. However, I decided to give it a shot, even though it had only just come into existence 3 years earlier. In early 2011, I joined our team at the beginning of the year. For the first few months, I didn't think I'd be able to stay motivated; however, after meeting a lot of people, it became very apparent that this type of training worked for them as well. Since then, I've continued to keep up with this program every week and have improved tremendously with each workout. Currently, I am attending a state level weightlifting competition scheduled in late April, which will likely be the last contest that I compete in before retirement (I plan on competing in power lifting as well).

[Update 11/14/2012]:

So far, everything seems to be working great. I lost almost 8lbs over the past 4 weeks, while gaining muscle strength and flexibility along the way. My back and shoulders look incredible. As long as I don't go too crazy and go too heavy (as there's no point if I lose my grip), I'm optimistic that I'll have good results this season!

My friend Justin mentioned that he had also experienced great improvements in his lifts after joining our gym. He also mentioned that he would like to join after graduation, but right now he doesn't see himself taking any chances on losing more than 1lb per week.

123,Question: hypothyroidism symptoms\nAnswer:,"Hypothyroidism

How to identify and treat hypothyroidism?

Symptoms of hypothyroidism may not be obvious. The most common symptom is a dull or depressed mood, called hypomania (1). Symptoms are usually mild in severity but can include feelings of irritability, restlessness, insomnia, weight gain, increased energy, muscle aches and pains, hair loss, low blood pressure, heart disease, high cholesterol, anxiety, depression, and more. People with the condition often have difficulty concentrating and memory problems.

Most people who have hypothyroidism do not experience any noticeable changes in their thyroid hormones when they drink coffee or tea. However, some patients develop hyperthyroidism (high thyroid hormone levels) while taking caffeine because of the way the body breaks down caffeine. High-dose caffeine, especially from caffeinated soft drinks, can cause this side effect. It is important for you to know that your doctor will watch for signs and symptoms of abnormal thyroid function before making a diagnosis of hypothyroidism.

Treatment for hypothyroidism

There is no cure for hypothyroidism, so treating it improves the chances of getting better. Doctors recommend that everyone over age 60 get regular checkups and treatment as needed.

A prescription thyroid medication is one option to help relieve symptoms of hypothyroidism. This type of medicine works by helping the body's cells convert thyroid hormone into T3. When this happens properly, healthy thyroid gland cells grow, releasing thyroxine and T4 to keep the body functioning normally.

Doctors also prescribe a combination of three different medications if symptoms persist after taking one thyroid drug alone. These medications work together to improve the effectiveness of each other, lowering the risk of developing serious complications like stroke or bleeding. Most doctors combine these drugs to prevent a person from becoming too sick to work and live independently.

Some doctors choose not to use a single medication, opting instead to treat all signs and symptoms. In cases where there is no response to one of the available medications, doctors might consider switching to an alternative medication or a combination of two or three medications.

Your doctor should advise you which one(s) of these options is best for you based on the symptoms you're experiencing. If you'd like advice about how to find out what you need, call your local doctor (or see our list below).","high cholesterol

Fluctuations in thyroid function

Frequency of thyroid activity, measured by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), may be less than the usual range. Symptoms include fatigue or weakness, depression, and weight gain. Hypothyroidism can also cause bone loss, making you more vulnerable to osteoporosis later in life. [7]

Hypothyroidism can be caused by a number of factors, including environmental exposure, infection with certain bacteria, drugs used for medical treatment, pregnancy, medications, aging, and genetic mutations.[8]

Symptoms that may indicate an underlying problem are not always present, but they could increase your risk for developing hypothyroidism. They might include:

Fatigue or sleepiness

Decreased energy levels

Headaches

Tremors

Mood swings

Constipation

Abnormal thyroid hormone production

Severe hyperthyroidism is associated with serious complications such as heart failure or stroke. In fact, the United States Center for Disease Control estimates that up to 80 percent of adults over 65 years old have some degree of subclinical hypothyroidism. But even mild hypothyroidism can still lead to health problems if left untreated. [9][10]","mild mental impairment, fatigue, depression and poor memory

Hypothyroidism affects almost 7% of the US population. In addition to health problems caused by a lack of thyroid hormone in your body (hypothyroidism), you may also have other symptoms that include:

Cognitive impairment – which is an inability to perform basic activities like driving or taking care of yourself. The signs of cognitive impairment can be subtle but they can include:

Difficulty concentrating on things

Slowed reaction time

Decreased problem-solving skills

Sensitivity to loud noises

Apathy

Memory loss

Weakness

The severity of these symptoms will vary based on what causes them. However, there are many reasons for not getting adequate amounts of thyroid hormone, including:","none,

Hypothyroidism and Thyrotoxicosis Symptoms

Many of the problems associated with hypothyroidism are due to overproduction of thyroid hormones. Hypothyroidism can lead to a variety of other conditions including obesity, heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, liver disease, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, sleep apnea, chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, joint pain, menstrual irregularities and even cancer. For this reason it is important that you take care when working out so as not to damage your body's cells and organs. Many people think that by exercising more they will get fat but there is no evidence that this is true. If the doctor thinks that you have hyperthyroidism then he or she may suggest that you try a thyroid medication which has been shown to work well in treating hyperthyroidism.

The thyroid hormone T4 has a half-life of 3 hours. This means that if you measure a serum level at 6 am on an average day you should be able to detect T4 levels for up to 4 days. The TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) level indicates how much T4 is being produced in your body. A normal TSH level is around 1.0 while an elevated one may indicate that there is too much T4 being made in your blood stream. It takes about two weeks before the TSH drops back down to its normal range. It is possible for some people to go through periods where their TSH goes high (over 2.5), however, this usually resolves itself within about three months.

When a person is diagnosed with hypothyroidism there are a number of tests which are done to check how well each part of the body is handling the hormone. These tests include thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FTO). Tests of these hormones show how well your body is handling both T3 and T4. If either test shows abnormally low levels the doctor may give the patient a prescription for either levothyroxine (a type of T4 medication) or triiodothyronine (T3) which both increase the production of T4 in the body.

To ensure that the medications prescribed to treat hypothyroidism do not affect your ability to become pregnant, there are several things you should know about. Your physician will perform a physical exam which includes checking your weight and height. They also ask questions regarding your diet and any allergies","You have no thyroid hormone imbalances.

Question: insomnia in your family? Answer: Your family history is not known for Hypothyroidism and there are many causes of insomnia. Please see the end of this booklet for more information on causes of sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, etc.

Question: a diagnosis of Hypothyroidism by blood work or urine analysis. Answer: Bloodwork, urinalysis, and a complete physical examination is recommended to diagnose Hypothyroidism, but is not required to make an initial diagnosis. The following criteria must be met before using any of these tests as part of an initial evaluation: 1) Thyroid hormones levels need to be measured within 3 months after starting medication; 2) thyroid function tests (T4, T3) should have been performed at least once every 6 months for three consecutive years prior to the start of treatment; 3) TSH should range between 0.2-0.5 mIU/L with an upper limit of 4.0 mIU/L. If these requirements are met, then all thyroid medications including levothyroxine may be started without further testing. For more information please contact your Doctor.

Question: how can I know whether my doctor has an interest in treating me with Low T? Answer: In general doctors who treat patients with low thyroid function are well educated about this condition. They will often ask you questions concerning how much thyroid hormone therapy you are taking, whether you are currently taking additional thyroid hormone replacement products, and what other conditions you might be experiencing that may be associated with low thyroid function such as depression.

Question: My physician states I am only mildly Hypothyroid according to his test results which says 'Normal'. Is this a correct diagnosis? Answer: Most clinicians use two different types of thyroid test to determine your level of Hypothyroidism. One type measures free thyroids in serum using a PTH assay. This gives an indication of the number of free thyroids present. A second test (also called a nuclear receptor binding antibody), uses antibodies specific to thyroid receptors in your body to measure a protein known as Free T4 or Free T3.

If your levels of Free T4 or Free T3 are under 15% of normal you probably have insufficient T4 activity. Treatment with prednisone will reduce T4 levels while increasing T3 levels to increase bone density. However if the levels of Free T4 or Free T3 are over 25%, or the Thyroid","Thyroid disorders, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease are the most common causes of symptoms in hypothyroid patients. However, there is a wide variety of other causes that can cause similar signs and symptoms.


Treatment for Hypothyroidism Symptoms (Hypothyroidism) Symptoms can vary with each individual patient, depending on age and overall health status, including medications used to treat or prevent other conditions or diseases, including hypothyroidism. Patients who have primary hypothyroidism should receive periodic blood testing to measure the amount of thyroid hormones circulating in their bodies. Most often this will be done by obtaining a complete blood cell count (CBC). The most commonly prescribed treatment for hypothyroidism is replacement doses of thyroxine or triiodothyronine. The replacement dosage usually includes an injection called levothyroxine. Other types of replacement therapy include the use of a ""Thyroid Stimulating Agent."" This medication stimulates the body's own production of thyroid hormone. If needed, it may also help the person tolerate additional injections. There are several different kinds of thyroid stimulating agents available. Some people prefer to take a combination of two or more forms of thyroid-stimulating agent at the same time so that they get the benefits of both medications. As mentioned above, some studies indicate that taking levothyroxine with parenteral nutrition improves the effects of the combined medication. While thyroid-stimulant drugs provide good results when taken together, there is no evidence of benefit from combining them with another drug that contains progestins like the oral contraceptive pill. If you choose to combine one of these treatments with your estrogen therapy, it is important to do so cautiously. Pregnant women, those undergoing surgery or radiation treatment, or individuals with autoimmune conditions are not advised to combine iodine intake with these types of medications.


Mood Disorders - Hyperthyroidism Can Cause Mood Changes In some cases of hyperthyroidism, depression or anxiety can occur after diagnosis due to changes in the brain chemicals responsible for mood control. This phenomenon has been reported in approximately 50% of patients treated with thyroxine for over 10 years. This condition may occur only temporarily during treatment, or persist into adulthood. To address the problem, doctors prescribe antidepressants or serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, venlafaxine, duloxetine, and","Hypothyroidism is a common condition that affects people of all ages. It causes your body to have too little T4 (thyroxine), which in turn raises your blood pressure and makes you feel tired. Hypothyroidism can also cause problems with the heart, brain or joints. The following symptoms are signs of hypothyroidism:

Weight gain

Fatigue

Thinning hair

Depression

Anemia

Loss of muscle mass

Nausea/vomiting

Joint pain

Weakness

Excess water retention

Low energy

Some of these problems usually go away after treatment but sometimes they may persist for years. Symptoms often improve on their own during pregnancy, so check with your doctor if you're pregnant or think you might be pregnant. You'll need medication to control your thyroid gland as well as an office visit every few months while you're pregnant. If any of these symptoms aren't going away after 2-3 weeks, call your doctor right away.

126,Question: birth control suppression antral follicle count\nAnswer:,"I think that's the way it is.

Q. What are your thoughts on the use of hormonal contraceptives? Do you find them helpful or harmful for various reasons? Answer: There isn't really a ""right"" answer to this question. In fact, it has become so polarized because every person looks at his/her own situation and decides what is best for her/him personally. Some people feel like they should take all the risks and not worry about birth control since their bodies are perfectly fine without these hormones anyway. For others, the hormone-free method offers a more comfortable, natural experience. But for some women who have difficulty with certain symptoms associated with birth control (such as acne, bloating) taking these medications may be beneficial. It's just something different for each woman.

I don't have any other medical problems that affect my body negatively in general. Most of my family members and friends do, though, so everyone can decide how he/she feels about using HRT medication to prevent pregnancy. One thing we all can agree on is that our lives would be easier if contraception were completely free!","No

Question: cesarean section\nAnswer: Yes

Question: Cervical cancer\nAnswer: No

Questions for which the answers were not available on their websites:

1. Is it true that one of every three American women will get breast cancer in her lifetime?

2. Are you aware that, since the 1970s, more than 100 million babies have been aborted worldwide? Answer: No

3. Does a woman's age matter when it comes to having an abortion? Answer: Yes

4. Did you know that many doctors are now telling women who are considering having an abortion they should postpone it until after their baby is born? Answer: Yes

5. If I am pregnant and have a miscarriage how soon do I go back to work or school? Answer: You can return to your job or school as soon as you are able. The sooner you begin treatment the better the outcome. However, if you are taking medication for a pre-existing condition or you feel you need to take certain medications before getting pregnant, talk with your doctor about what could affect your pregnancy. If you decide to continue your pregnancy it is important to make sure your health insurance covers any medical expenses related to the miscarriage or premature delivery.

6. What does it mean when an egg has come from a man but has no sperm in it yet? Answer: In this situation there may be chromosomal abnormalities present. This would explain why ovulation was delayed or missing altogether. Women with abnormal eggs have had miscarriages or stillbirths. It also means that you cannot become pregnant by artificial insemination (AI) and/or IVF. Your only option is natural conception.

7. How long does it take to recover from an induced abortion? Answer: Most people are able to resume normal activities within 12 hours. After two weeks most women can be back at work or school, although some require additional time to regain normal hormone levels. Some women who have had abortions later in life report feeling guilty because they did not try to keep the pregnancy. They may feel guilty because of feelings such as sadness, guilt and grief over the loss of a child. Acknowledge these feelings and try to understand them without being judgmental.

8. Are you aware that approximately 10% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage? Answer: No

9. Do you believe that life begins at fertilization or implantation? Answer: Life begins at conception.","Yes

Brief explanation of the procedure (for example, ""We are taking a tablet that will prevent you from becoming pregnant."")

1.2 What information should I provide to my healthcare provider before the procedure?

Your partner(s) must complete an informed consent form which includes questions about your medical history and current or past use of oral contraceptives (OC), whether you have ever been diagnosed with cancer, heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or other health conditions affecting fertility, as well as any allergies you may be having. If possible, your partners should also complete a questionnaire asking how long they've had sex in the past 6 months, their age at first intercourse, how frequently they have sex during the previous year and, if applicable, what type of condom or barrier method they currently use. Please note that when answering this survey you are not required to disclose all information about your sexual history or current reproductive status; however, it is recommended that you do so for the purposes of obtaining accurate answers. This survey is completely voluntary; no one can force you to take part. The results of this study will only be made available to your doctor after completion of the interview. In addition, we want to ensure that our participants understand that the decision to participate in these studies and to receive clinical treatments depends on them participating fully and honestly. Participants who decline participation due to concerns regarding confidentiality could still participate in future studies, but they would need to contact us directly to discuss additional information pertaining to the study.

1.3 How many days and hours before the procedure should I stay home? Can I stop working or school to rest up and prepare for the procedure?

The duration of your recovery period from the procedure depends on several factors, including your body's ability to handle the medication and time since last dose. You should start the process of healing immediately after your treatment session to avoid potential complications such as infection, bleeding, bruising, discomfort, nausea, or vomiting. Most people heal within 4-8 weeks without incident. However, depending on your medical condition, your recovery time may vary significantly from this timeframe. It is important that you consult your physician prior to initiating any medication to determine the safest dosage for yourself to minimize the risk of side effects. For women with cervical dysplasia, we recommend starting the recovery process 2-4 weeks after initial insertion of the ring or patch. To reduce your chance of complications, please allow extra time between visits to make sure you receive the best care possible. We encourage you to continue","low

Q13. What is the average number of menstrual cycles per woman with and without oral contraceptives? A. The mean duration of menses was 27 days for women who had never used any hormonal contraceptive (3.6 months) or were taking only ethinyl estradiol-containing pills, whereas it was 31 days in those who took a combination pill containing both estrogen and progestin (3.8 months). In women using combined oral contraceptives, this median value also includes women on low dose norethindrone acetate capsules, because some women may have been exposed to more than one type of hormone during their menstrual cycle.

Q14. How many women take oral contraceptives each year? A. The most recent national estimate of the number of U.S. women aged 15 years and older using oral contraceptives was from 2003. For women ages 15 to 19 years, the estimated number of females using oral contraceptives each year ranges from 2.4 million to 3.2 million. For women 20 to 24 years old, the estimated number ranges from 1.9 million to 2.5 million; the corresponding figures for men are 6.7 million to 7.1 million (see Table C-2). Among young adult women who currently use oral contraceptives, approximately 8% report that they first took them at age 12 or younger and 17% reported having taken them as teenagers. This analysis does not include data on pregnancies.

Number of adolescents using oral contraception has declined since 1998. There were an estimated 8.0 million current users of oral contraceptives in 1999, compared with 3.6 million in 2002, resulting in a decline of almost 50%. However, the percentage of sexually active adolescents reporting using oral contraceptives increased over this period, suggesting that there is still considerable variation among youth in their level of sexual activity, frequency of sexual intercourse, and attitudes about contraceptive methods (CDC 2004","none

Birth Control Pills (Contraception)

This is a class of drugs that suppress ovulation, but do not prevent conception.

These medications are used as contraception when taken for 12 months or longer. They may also be used as emergency contraception if you miss your period and then take the pills. The most commonly prescribed pill in this category includes oral contraceptives. The combination hormone estrogen-progestin pills may be effective at preventing pregnancy and can be very helpful during certain types of cancer treatment. In many cases, these medicines have no side effects.

The following drugs are known to cause abortion or miscarriage:

Ovarian cysts

Estradiol

Progesterone

Mifepristone

Norethisterone

Ruptagel

Tetrahydrogestrinone

Zovia (brand name Yasmin)

Soripenem/ethinyl estradiol/ethinyl sebacate/levonorgestrel/ethinyl stearate

Q7. What are the different types of contraception and how do they work?

A. Contraceptives prevent pregnancy by preventing ovulation, which means that if you have sex while using a contraceptive method or after having sex with another person during your fertile period, the sperm is unable to fertilize an egg (the one in your uterus) because it has been blocked or impeded from reaching an egg. There are three main kinds of contraceptives: vaginal ring, intrauterine device (IUD), and implant. The IUD is the most effective form of long-term contraception currently available. It works by releasing small amounts of hormones into the uterine wall. Because it releases just enough hormones for it to be effective, these methods are only available as long as you use them regularly. If you don't use them, you may experience side effects such as spotting, pain, heavy bleeding, and cramping. If any of these problems occur, you should talk to your doctor about other options. Some people also choose to get pregnant naturally (without using hormonal methods). For example, many women who want to become mothers take home remedies such as garlic and chamomile tea to make their menstrual cycles less regular. Other strategies include taking extra birth control pills every day for several years so you will avoid missed periods when you're trying to conceive, or taking a drug called gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs (GnRHaAs) to mimic the natural process of ovulation.

Q8. How does contraception affect fertility?

A. Most methods of contraception can cause some degree of infertility. However, depending on the type of contraception used and the woman's health history, contraceptive methods might help increase fertility or even replace some fertility loss. You'll need to see your physician if you'd like more information.

Q9. Can all forms of contraception help reduce risk of STDs?

A. Contraceptive pills (such as Plan B One-Step) may help lower the chance of getting infections caused by bacteria such as Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis, HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis C (HCV) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1). Some birth control pills contain estrogen, which can decrease the chances of getting certain types of cancer, including cervical cancer. Birth control patches, rings, and spermicides (creams) can protect against STIs such as gonorrhea and genital warts.

Question: Why should I avoid contact lenses with a coating of any kind? A. This is because many manufacturers have tried to market their contacts as being non-allergenic. Contact lens makers want you to wear their product to prevent contact allergy outbreaks! See the answer in the previous question for a more detailed explanation.


Question: What do you mean by ""contact lens"" and ""glasses?"" A. As used here in this website, contact lenses are eyeglasses that cover your eye's surface to ensure proper vision; contact lenses usually have no lens covering (though some may be coated).

Glasses are worn on top of contact lenses or over them. They provide additional protection from harmful radiation from solar energy but they don't cover the entire eyes. If you put contacts and/or glasses on while swimming, diving, flying etc., you'll need to apply sunscreen after coming up for air.

Question: What kind of sunglasses can protect my eyes from UV rays, e.g. from sun lamps?


A. UVB rays range between 330 nm to 400 nm, which means that at the shortest wavelengths they can reach skin directly, without getting through the atmosphere, and at the longest wavelengths they can penetrate into the cornea of the eye. The amount of exposure depends upon the length of time the light is present – longer exposures result in more damage. Sunlight causes all kinds of photochemical reactions within the body, including production of free radicals, changes in membrane permeability, formation of reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, and even inflammation. If enough UVB is given over a prolonged period of time, it can cause corneal ulceration, keratitis, cataracts, etc. But not only is UVB damaging to your eyes, it also damages your skin. UV rays can burn your eyes, so we recommend you wear sunglasses made specifically to block ultraviolet light. For details on sunglasses you can consult the LensSafe website.

Q: what is the difference between a fidget spinner and a motorized toy? Answer: not much but they are both fun!

Q: What should I do when my son has a seizure? Answer: don't touch him. Don't sit or lean over him, and if you can manage to get up off the couch, go to bed.

Q: Why does your daughter have seizures and not me? Answer: because she's a girl, it just happens more often in girls than boys. We're going to try to raise her to be as independent as possible so that she doesn't need her mommy after she gets out of the hospital.

Q: My son keeps getting his eyes watery. He says he might have a little dehydration or something… Can you check on him? Is there anything we could do?? It seems like he always needs some kind of medicine or another thing. Any suggestions will be appreciated!! Thank you!

A: This is extremely common with people who suffer from epilepsy. You know what to do now.

What to Do When Your Son Has a Seizure

1. Get him into the backseat of your car. A large stuffed animal (like a cat) will make this easier.

2. Take one good look at him, then tell him to lie down on his stomach. You'll see he is sweating profusely, which means he may have gotten very thirsty. If he cries too much, open the window a bit. But don't force him; rather, use gentle guidance as you get close to him so that he feels comfortable lying flat. Once he lies down, you should see him starting to breathe normally again – usually within minutes.

3. Tell someone else about this situation right away. Be sure to say the name of the person who brought your child to the ER and ask them to call 911.

4. Call 811 immediately. Make sure you leave a message telling them who called and where the child was taken. Be sure to mention your own name as well. Then, wait for an operator to arrive – ideally before 5 p.m. The dispatcher will help with any questions or concerns you have. After all, they'll be trying to figure out how your child got here.

5. If the ambulance crew arrives at the scene, stay calm – keep talking to the crew. Listen carefully, even if you aren't sure what they're saying. They","yes, you will need to get new glasses.

I think it might work! I'll start with a quick review.

How do they work?

First let me describe two types of contacts (and their benefits) as far as I can remember.

A) Contact lens solution (conventional), which is usually applied via a syringe.

B) Prescription contact lens solution (pharmaceutical grade). This is used by opticians who have expertise in optical diagnosis. It contains both the drug that prevents damage caused by UV rays and the ""binder"" substance that forms the contacts. The drug slows down the absorption process of ultraviolet radiation. It also helps improve the vision-friendly coating inside the lens. In addition, there is a small amount of anti-reflective material added for better refractive accuracy.

Prescription lenses work by diffusing excess UV rays; conventional contacts diffuse only visible light. Because of this, they offer improved visibility under normal circumstances, and some people prefer conventional contacts over prescription ones because they may appear less distracting.

Since prescription lenses are not necessary for day-to-day use, they cost more than the regular frames. They are also not suitable for all individuals – some people find the prescription lenses uncomfortable. That's why I personally recommend using prescriptions, especially if you already wear contacts.

There are some advantages to using a custom prescription frame. For example, you could easily order one made just for you, and then add your own frames, lenses or inserts. Of course, the cost would be higher, but once again, you're making your own choice.",we will release more details soon.,"Yes.

130,Question: neck and shoulder stretches\nAnswer:,"These are good for the shoulders, but they can also be done with the back.

Q: Shoulder flexion exercises\nAnswer: This is a stretch that you do by lying flat on your stomach, grabbing hold of your arm and bringing it over to your shoulder. Hold this position for 5-10 seconds. Then try doing it as if you were lifting the weight in your hand or pulling it away from your body. Repeat for 10 repetitions.

Q: Back flexion exercises\nAnswer: If you have low back pain, there's one exercise that I recommend. Lie face down on the floor, grab your ankles and pull them up toward your hips while keeping your knees bent. Do this exercise five times. Now start moving your legs so that your calves turn out slightly. Don't make yourself lean forward; just bend your knees. You should now feel a slight stretch at the top of your thighs. Repeat the same thing with your other leg. Try this exercise three times a day for 15 minutes each time.

Q: Abdominal flexion exercises\nAnswer: It's also important to work on abdominal muscles. Lie on your stomach with your elbows resting on the ground and hold for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Next, put your hands behind your head and rotate your torso clockwise. Keep your arms straight. Do this movement for 3 sets of 10 reps.","you may not stretch the same side or both sides at one time, but they will get your body in a good position to move through the exercise.

Q: What is a ""core-strengthening"" core workout?


A: A core strengthening workout will help strengthen muscles that support your spine.

Some of these exercises include:

-Plank hold

-Cable crunch (holds for 30 seconds)

-Hyperextension exercise (holds for 60 sec)

-Wall sit (sit on a wall with legs straight out in front of you, feet flat on the ground)

-Bent over pull up, lying face down on the floor. Use a chair or bench if possible. You should be able to bend forward completely by using just your upper arms. Hold this for 10 seconds, then lower yourself back down until your shoulders are resting against the seat. Repeat 4 times. Try to do it about 3x per week. This is great exercise for those who have trouble sitting without having pain.

-Upright rows, lying supine with elbows bent

-Reverse crunches, laying on your stomach and pulling your head back as far as possible without turning your torso too much. The key here is to stay calm during each rep, keep an even tension throughout. Also try to focus on pushing your abs hard.

-Weighted chin ups on the weight set. Do 25 reps, rest 2 minutes between sets.

-Pull-up variations. For example, you can do rows instead of chin ups, or use the weighted version.

-Alternate dumbbell curls and tricep extensions with biceps cable curls. Make sure you alternate between all three sets and make sure you finish each set with full range of motion.


The important thing is to always give yourself some rest before doing any heavy muscle building exercises like squats or deadlifts. If you do too many repetitions too fast, you'll tire quickly and you won't feel very strong afterward.","This is a question that I've had many times. The answer to this one should be simple, but there are some good reasons why stretching the neck and shoulder muscles can't hurt you.

Stretching the neck and shoulder muscles may seem to help in a few areas, but it won't hurt at all.

In fact, it will actually improve your strength and endurance. It's like a muscle exercise for your neck and shoulders, which means it gives you great health benefits because of its muscular strengthening effect on your muscles.

A study conducted by researchers at Michigan State University showed that those people who did these exercises were able to perform more repetitions with less rest time than their untrained peers.

This kind of training could be useful to anyone. If you want to lose weight or improve muscle tone and flexibility, then you're going to need some kind of resistance training.

However, if you just do any old stretching routine without any sort of exercise you risk injury from overuse and poor technique. So before you stretch try some easy moves first.

#3 – How to do a Basic Side Lie

Lie face down on your side with your legs straight. Make sure your knees are on the floor. Keeping your chest up and eyes closed take your hands off of your feet, turn around and place them on either side of your head, like this:

Then you will rotate your hips clockwise so that your right hip is parallel to the ground while rotating your left hip at the same time. You should feel something similar to this:

Now as before, push yourself away from your body, keep your arms overhead and try to pull your head into your shoulders.

As in any other Side Lie exercise use both sides equally.

Question: how to do a basic side lie?

Answer: The basic side lie consists of lifting your upper body up against the ceiling while keeping your lower body still on the ground.

You have already seen one version of this exercise here.

#4 – How to Do Backbends

To perform a back bend it's necessary for you to know two things: first of all you have to hold onto an object and secondly you have to stretch or relax. As I mentioned before holding onto an object can be quite challenging so if you don't have access to one then there are plenty of alternatives which allow you to extend your spine without having to go to extremes.

The most common options include using pillows to support your upper body. When laying flat on top of these pillow you will make it more difficult for gravity to compress your spinal discs. If this isn't possible then the next best thing would be to position your upper body underneath something sturdy such as a desk chair.

When doing a back bend always keep your weight distributed evenly across both shoulders to ensure that your muscles are properly engaged during each step.

A simple way to practice the movement is to start by simply lowering your body slightly and then slowly raising it back up again. It's important that your head doesn't move too far forward but instead stay perfectly level throughout. Once you've mastered the basic back bend it's","The following exercises will provide a ton of benefits. They are also great for improving flexibility and coordination, as well as helping prevent injury!


Lying down with your feet on the floor (or something similar) hold onto a wall or table. Keep your back straight while keeping your arms out in front of you like you're holding an umbrella. Don't push them forward at all! Keeping your head level allows us to keep our shoulders relaxed. Now relax your shoulders fully. You can really stretch the long head area by doing this exercise. When you reach full range of motion, go back up. Repeat 2-3 times then repeat 3 more times. At first, it may feel hard, but after about 30 seconds you'll notice that you can do this with ease. Do not try to move too fast here. Relaxing your shoulder muscles takes time, so just be patient. Go through each repetition slowly at first until you feel comfortable with it. Once you get to the point where you can comfortably do one movement without any discomfort, start moving faster again. As long as your body feels good when you're stretching, you should not have to stop at any point during your practice. If anything, I'd recommend going even harder if you want to make sure your muscles stay stretched and healthy throughout the day.


As an added bonus, this exercise is great for preventing injuries. Your muscles take over after a few days, allowing you to work harder and longer than before.


Sit on the edge of your bed or couch, facing away from the door, knees bent. Tuck your chin into your chest and let your elbows rest on the backs of your thighs. Reach toward your right hand. Feel how loose your muscles are now? Good. Push yourself forward as high as you can by reaching with your left hand. Hold for 5 minutes and then release. Practice this every other day.


A version of this exercise uses your lower abdomen. Sit on the edge of a chair. Stand behind you and raise your torso off the ground by bending down slightly. Lift both legs above your hips and extend both arms parallel to the floor towards the ceiling. Lower the body back down once it's almost at your knees. That's the general idea.


Take a deep breath in, then exhale completely. Hold it and return to normal breathing technique.


Practice these 10 everyday stretching movements daily!","In the first exercise you're moving your back and shoulders, then move them forward.

Next time you perform this exercise try to keep your arms straight in front of you and keep your elbows close together. This will make it easier for you to do this stretch.

The following exercise is similar but focuses on stretching the head and neck area. Remember that your shoulder girdle should be relaxed as well so we won't be focusing too much attention here on that part of your body. Just imagine that you are putting a pillow under your head. Now imagine that you have a thick towel (or blanket) over top of that pillow. Slowly roll up the towel or blanket until you feel pressure against your ears. If you can't feel any pressure at all then you probably didn't get enough tension into your shoulders and neck.

If your neck feels a bit loose while doing these exercises then relax your neck by tilting it toward your feet when performing each movement. You can also take your hands off the edge of the bed.

This exercise should only take about 2 minutes with rest intervals between each set. Keep the chest down and neck stable during this stretch. The last thing you want to do is arch your back excessively because you may cause yourself further damage. Try not to let your legs buckle either!


Muscles Worked During Shoulder Stretches

Shoulders

Exercise #1 - Lower Back Stretch

Lie face-down with your spine extended in front of a wall. Keeping your head erect, bend your left arm behind your right elbow. Hold this position for 30 seconds.

Then slowly lower your upper torso towards the floor. Do not pause before reaching the floor. Then return to the starting position without pausing. Rest at least 10 seconds after completing each repetition.

Exercise #2 - Lateral Bend

Hold the positions listed above for 20 seconds. Then bring both elbows to the sides in a 90° angle and lift the arms out to the sides. Repeat on the other side for 15 reps.

Remember that if there's pain or numbness in your shoulder flexors you'll probably need more than one session of shoulder stretching. But if the pain goes away after one session, you'll be ready to start regular shoulder routine.","This is a great stretch for the lower back, but you need to be careful not to pull or twist. I learned this from one of our yoga teachers when he was teaching at my school.

Step 3. Pull on the belt. Repeat Step 1 until your hand comes off the end of the chain. Now go out of the room and do your stretches.


Back stretch - How to do it

This should feel good!

The front of the body stays in position while you gently pull with each hand.

Here's an example. There are two different ways of doing this exercise. The first way works better if your wrists are loose and relaxed, so that you can move them independently without feeling tension or strain.

Your feet should be firmly planted behind your head and shoulders. Keep your arms straight by keeping your hands flat on the ground (no twists), and slowly press down on the chains with your palms facing downward and the fingers together. You'll feel the tension in your upper back relax as your hands push against the chains. If you don't have any resistance, try a few more repetitions until you're able to keep a slight pressure on the chains.

If you like the ""push-pull"" method above, then try the following variation.

Start in the same position, except now you put your hands under the bars and grab hold with both hands; there should be enough space between your hands to work with. Again, apply some pressure on the chains with your palms and squeeze hard until they release. Your goal here is to get as much force into the chains as possible, as opposed to letting them just rest quietly. When you can't get more force into the chains anymore, start over again!


How to do it correctly

When doing these exercises correctly, your arms stay bent at 90 degrees and your elbows remain locked. You keep your chest low and your belly sticking up. When you perform each set, you should only let your arms drift sideways slightly. It's okay to feel a little bit of a stretch at the beginning because you'll probably make mistakes at first. After you've done the exercise about 10 times, you can gradually increase the speed of the movement. Once you can maintain a steady pace, you can decrease the number of sets.","these are two of the most common stretching exercises for the neck. They allow you to stretch your muscles in areas that don't get enough attention when trying to improve your posture and keep you healthy as well! You'll also want to try out this one because it's very similar to the other, but with more emphasis on your backside.

2) Neck Pigeon Pose

Benefits: This is a great exercise to help relieve pressure in your neck and shoulders while working through all the different aspects of your posture. It makes a huge difference in how easy it feels to sit up straight and how stable your spine feels. Additionally, you'll be strengthening those core muscles as well as stabilizing your upper body to ensure that you're not falling over from time to time, which can lead to injury.

How To Do It: Lie face down with your feet flat on the floor and your toes pointed slightly forward. Cross your arms over your chest and pull them away from your ears and look at your hands, palms facing inward. Gently tilt your head and shoulders to the right (toward your hand), then rotate it to the left (toward your hand). Inhale and bring your chin toward your chest until your eyes meet at a 90 degree angle. Hold for 5-30 seconds, repeating 3-5 times. Repeat on the opposite side. For added challenge, do this pose while looking straight ahead, tilting your pelvis upward as if you were about to take off your shoes!

3) Shoulder Tuck Stretch

Benefits: One of the best stretches you can do to strengthen your shoulder complex and increase range of motion for your rotator cuff muscles. This is especially helpful if you have some shoulder pain, or if you struggle to hold onto your dumbbells during your set. If you're new to yoga, start by doing this gentle variation first; make sure to let each movement rest approximately 5-10 seconds before starting again to avoid burnout!

How To Do It: Begin on your mat with both of your hands touching the mat. Slowly bend your elbows so they point directly above you. As you move your elbows towards your sides, slowly draw them back until they touch your wrists. Then repeat the process with your arms extended overhead. Make sure to breathe deeply into your belly every few breaths. Don't worry if you feel any discomfort, as this is a very mild stretch.

4) Side Angle

Benefits: This is another excellent stretch","Shoulder Flexion.

Q: Is the lower back too tight? Answer: Yes, it is. If you are doing yoga, you will see that there is a lot of emphasis on stretching the upper part of the body (back) while the shoulders are still in place. When you first start out with this type of exercise, your shoulders may feel very tense after you stretch them. They need to relax so they can be more flexible and able to move as freely as possible. You should also be able to use one or both arms to provide support for each other at all times when performing these exercises.

A good way to work toward releasing tension and allowing flexibility in the lower back, but not in the shoulders, is to make sure the head and neck are relaxed. In fact, I recommend keeping a tennis ball under your chin for 30 seconds before every set of these poses, especially if you have had problems with muscle knots in the past. The key is to keep the neck relaxed throughout the entire routine. To do this simply hold a light ball between the thumb and index finger of each hand, without moving your head or eyes from side-to-side. This allows you to use gravity to help release the knots that have been building up over time. Try this anytime, anywhere, as long as you are working towards proper alignment of the spine. Do NOT try to force yourself into a certain position by pushing hard against any of the points of resistance; this is counterproductive. For example, try lying face down and holding a light tennis ball between the thumb and index finger of each hand. Just let go of the ball slowly without trying to squeeze it like a ball. Let gravity take care of all that and then pull up on the ball as much as you want. By gradually easing the pressure off the balls, you will find that it becomes easier to get into proper alignment. If you don't notice how easy it is to become more relaxed just by relaxing your hands and letting gravity take care of it, you aren't practicing relaxation enough! Relaxation is what keeps us healthy.

Back | Top","Back stretches are an excellent stretch for the shoulders, but I do not include them in my exercises because of a very important reason.

The muscles of your back should be relaxed before you begin to work on your wrists. The purpose is to develop your forearm strength through passive tension. This will increase with time if you use proper form. It takes only about 10 seconds per muscle to strengthen it. You can also add more movements into this section. If you feel a problem or have any questions, ask me! Also, remember that working on your wrist flexibility will help you perform better at all other parts of your game.

Q: Shoulder blades (shoulder blades) stretching

A: A great way to improve your shoulders is to practice these shoulder blade stretches by yourself before practicing against others. Remember to start from the same position as when doing the exercises, and just relax when going over the top of each movement. Use a foam roller for this exercise. It's simple, and it makes a huge difference. Practice these shoulder blades stretches for 5-10 minutes a day.

1. Place a towel under the edge of a table so you're able to rest your arm on the back side.

2. Take your hands off the edge of the table and place them behind your head (not behind your ears).

3. Squeeze your bicep, pull the skin between your shoulder blades toward your spine and pull the skin back, while contracting your quadriceps. Repeat 2 times.

4. Stretch your left shoulder blade towards the ceiling, keeping your elbows bent.

5. Spread your right arm out wide, then gently squeeze your triceps, pulling the skin away from your back. Keep your elbow in contact with the floor. Make sure to keep the fingers together and don't bend the elbow. Hold for 30-60 seconds.

6. Rotate both arms so they face forward.

7. Repeat 6 steps again. Try to complete 3 sets of 15 repetitions.


It doesn't matter how long you hold the previous exercises for. They'll become easier after some days. When you go to train, try to start with your arms extended straight ahead, and slowly contract your biceps to make them bigger and stronger. Be patient and don't rush to reach your goal immediately.

I hope this information helps you strengthen and stretch your chest and arms. Please feel free to post any comments below."
131,Question: exercises for better posture\nAnswer:,"1. sit on the floor with your feet flat on the floor, and your legs together (straight).

2. raise one leg up off the ground until it's at a 90-degree angle to your body, then bend that knee down and keep it there as you put the other foot down in front of it.

3. repeat with the other leg.

4. hold each position for 30 seconds.

5. repeat this exercise 3 more times.


6. If you're very weak, start by holding an exercise pose for 30 seconds with just your left arm. This will build strength on that side. Then try to do a similar position using both arms for 30 seconds. The next step is to use your right hand, so hold the same position using only your left arm. Do 30 seconds for each arm. Repeat 10 more times with different combinations of hands.


7. Try to make sure the weight isn't too heavy or you'll have trouble keeping your balance. For example, if you can barely stand on your toes, you might want to start out doing this without any support from your arms. You may find that holding a light book helps you feel stronger.


8. If you find that this exercise causes you pain, you may be able to stop it by taking some ice on the muscles.


9. Inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth while keeping your head still. Continue breathing in until you feel a slight tingling sensation throughout the muscle group, then inhale through your mouth again. It should take less than 5 minutes for you to get comfortable doing this. Once you've gotten used to the position, you can gradually increase the time between breaths.


10. After you've developed good posture with this exercise, practice it on all sides. That way when you go back home, you don't need to buy new shoes!","sit-ups and crunches.

The next question is about exercise equipment\nAnswer: There are a lot of different types of exercise machines, but in general you'll be using one that has handles or pedals on the front and another type which also comes with handlebars but without pedals. For example, some people use treadmills and others use bicycles to work out at home. The most common kind of exercise machine available is called an aerobic or resistance training machine (sometimes referred to as an exercise bike). Aerobic training machines have wheels so they can spin on both sides of the body (on one side if your legs are longer than your torso) while performing various exercises such as walking, jogging, swimming, running and cycling. Resistance training machines use bands or cables to pull or push weights up against resistance plates connected by pulleys. They're generally used for strength training.

What types of weight training do I need?

There are two main forms of weight lifting: linear and compound. Linear means that you lift progressively heavier objects over time. Compound means that you combine multiple movements into one movement – for instance, squats, deadlifts, bench presses and shoulder press. Each type of weightlifting requires different tools and equipment and requires you to perform specific exercises. You may want to refer back to our earlier answer to see what kind of weightlifting equipment is recommended.


Linear Strength Training Machine - this machine uses straight bars with either handles or straps to add resistance, but doesn't come equipped with wheels. Some machines do offer a wheel system for certain exercises, however, these usually aren't very good quality, and not all machines actually include wheels anyway. This type of weightlifting machine is ideal for beginners because it's easier to learn how to use, and less likely to break down. It's best to keep track of your reps, sets and rest periods using a timer or stopwatch. To get the most out of this machine, start slow and make sure you spend enough time working through each rep before moving onto the next. A common mistake is to try to increase your total reps over time rather than focusing on getting more reps per set. If you find yourself reaching failure after 3-4 repetitions before increasing volume, then something isn't right. Once you've learned the proper form and technique, then gradually increase the weight and/or move up the difficulty level. Linear strength training is often associated with powerlifters who use them to build their upper bodies. Because they require greater skill","sit-ups and shoulder presses

Question: exercises to tone up your spine\nAnswer: crunches, pull-ups, and bent-over rows (but not bench press)

Question: exercises that build muscle\nAnswer: bodyweight exercises like push ups, pull ups, and squats; but you should also do weightlifting if you can lift more than 40 pounds. The key is to take care of the joints that are going to be working hard. You'll notice that most people spend a lot of time worrying about their low back—and they're probably doing it wrong!

Q&A With Tim Ferris

Question: What's your favorite way to eat?


Ferris: I'm so lucky in my diet because I don't have any cravings and I always feel full. But when I want something sweet or savory, there's nothing that I can eat that won't make me feel full too. When I was growing up, when we had lunch, we would each get a piece of bread and cheese with peanut butter on it. We'd call it a sandwich. If you went out for French fries every day, by the end of high school you were eating a pound of fries every single day.

Ferris: I wouldn't go back to college. That's where I learned how to be an entrepreneur: building a business from scratch and getting it off the ground. After I graduated, I didn't know what else to do and I thought that maybe entrepreneurship wasn't for me. But as soon as I started selling the business to someone else and trying to figure out what other opportunities might present themselves, I realized that I really wanted to start another company after this one failed. I've been running businesses since I was in middle school and I'm still learning all these new skills. So now I just try to learn them until they fall into place and then I move on.","sit on your chair, and put some cushioning under it.

QUESTIONS FOR YOUR DREAMS

In order to have a dream like this one you must realize that your dreams are your thoughts, so if you want to know what you really want in life then just ask yourself: ""What am I thinking about?"" You might not even be able to figure it out right away, but when you start asking questions such as these: What would I do with my life if I could do anything? Or What is important to me? etc., or ""Why should I choose X over Y?"", you will begin to see how far you can get in understanding your own feelings and desires. As you become more familiar with your own thoughts, you may find yourself questioning other people's, and even making assumptions that others don't, which may lead to further exploration of your own personal world.","take time to sit and stretch your legs, hips, back and shoulders.

Question: exercises that can help you in a car or on the road/answer: just do them!

Question: exercise tips that will get you ready for long runs?\nAnswer: read a book, listen to music or watch a movie while doing them, eat healthy food, don't drink too much water during or after, make sure you sleep well, etc…


Question: is it important to hydrate more often than not when training for an event such as marathon, half marathon or ultra?\nAnswer: yes! (1) Drink more fluids before, during and after workouts. (2) Take lots of electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium and chloride. (3) When exercising and sweating, try to drink 1-2 glasses per hour. Water and sports drinks are the best choices because they keep you hydrated and satisfy other nutritional needs.


Questions: What should I do if my muscles hurt more than usual?\nAnswer: start at least one day prior to an upcoming workout and go easy on them until they feel normal again. Also try to avoid heavy lifting (squats, deadlifts, bench presses, etc…) for a few days. Don't forget to use stretching as well. Your muscles need some time to rest between workouts so give them plenty of space to heal.


Question: How do I build muscle mass without using steroids? Answer: use weights and/or cardio, but never overdo it (i.e. train to failure). You'll end up building lean body mass whereas using steroids may have an opposite effect. The same goes for cutting – remember: when done right, it's actually beneficial to your health!","get your ass out of the chair and sit on the floor, or push off from it.

Q9) Are there any advantages to using a different type of exercise program?

A9) Yes, in that they make you feel more energetic, better at performing the workout, and less sore afterwards.

Q10) How often should I workout? What kind of weightlifting workouts do you recommend?

A10) For anyone who has been lifting weights regularly for many years, we suggest starting with a few bodyweight-only exercises. As time goes by, progress to heavier weight classes. You will begin to notice a difference in how fast you can lift heavy objects and improve your flexibility as well. If you have had serious knee injuries, we highly recommend staying away from all running. We always urge people to find an appropriate form of conditioning exercise before attempting jumping rope, crossfit, swimming, etc..

The last thing we would advise is making dramatic gains in just a short amount of time. The average person cannot handle significant weight increases overnight. A good rule of thumb is to start slowly (and gradually build up over several months), then take the necessary steps toward the goal each month.

How can I keep my ears from ringing? Answer: Relax your body by using one of several techniques. You may do a ""semi-silent"" relaxation, in which you hold your breath while moving your head or arms away from each other. For a more intense effort, try breathing quietly through your nose while slowly closing your eyes. Or try alternating between slow and fast movements with a slow inhalation and an immediate exhalation (exhale and inhale quickly). Try different exercises for different parts of your earlobes. One good technique is the ""chin-up."" Start in an easy plank position. As you reach overhead, gently bend forward and rest on your elbows; then lower yourself down into an even deeper stretch. When you're done, relax your face, neck and upper back. If you want to tone up your neck muscles, try doing chin-ups.

Do I need glasses when exercising? Answer: Glasses are not necessary when exercising but they will help to make it easier and more comfortable to see what you're doing.

Q9 – How can I be sure that I'm doing a good practice? A9 – To make sure your practice is going well, ask yourself three questions. Is there tension in my body? Are my feet straightened out properly? Do I have any soreness in the joints or muscles in my body?

A10- What do yoga postures look like when practiced correctly? A10 -When practiced correctly, yoga poses actually change the way our bodies work because they stretch and strengthen different parts of our body. They are also very easy to learn, which makes it easier for most people to stick with them.

132,Question: headpats scalp psoriasis\nAnswer:,"yes, psoriatic scalp psoriasis and psoriasis with erythema are often accompanied by a reduction in scalp hair growth. This is called psoriasis of the scalp.","psoriasis

head pats scalp psoriasis

Headpats

A scalp pats is a type of facial massage technique, that involves rubbing the skin with the palms of your hands. A scalp pats is used to relieve itching caused by inflammation or infection in the hair follicles.

Symptoms and Types

Depending on the cause, there are two types of scalp pats. The first type consists of gentle rubbing of one hand over the back part of the scalp (the part where hair grows). In this condition, some patients report having only mild discomfort.

The second type usually involves pulling the fingers of one hand under one's chin and moving them upwards to rub the forehead, which causes more pain. Often, sufferers also experience itchiness and redness in their eyes.

If you have severe scalp psoriasis, you may notice an increase in your symptoms after experiencing a scalp pats. This is especially true if your scalp has been involved with rashes for long periods of time, such as from eating spicy foods, smoking, using tobacco or from excessive sun exposure. You should consult your doctor immediately if you begin experiencing any signs of scalp psoriasis following a scalp pats.

Causes

Scalp psoriasis can be caused by environmental factors, such as dandruff, certain medications, hormone changes or infections such as herpes simplex virus.

Risk Factors

People who carry the Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1, commonly known as HSV-1, are at higher risk for developing scalp psoriasis than those without this virus. Having frequent genital contact with an infected person, particularly during adolescence, increases your risk of developing scalp psoriasis.

Complications

There are no reports of significant complications arising from scalp pats. However, since scalp pats are a common form of physical exercise, they are not recommended for everyone.","yes.

Q: I have noticed that my hair is getting thicker and thinner, even though it does not hurt. Could this be a sign of psoriasis?

A: Yes.

Question: My hair has been thinning for years. Have you ever heard of a disease called ""Hair Loss"" as it applies to psoriasis? What can you tell me about it?

A: Hair loss can be caused by any number of conditions or diseases, such as:

-thyroid disease -thyrotoxicosis -liver disease -multiple sclerosis (MS) -Alzheimer's disease -bronchopulmonary dysplasia – which causes thickened blood vessels in the lungs

If your hair gets thinner, there may also be an increased risk of a life threatening condition called ""Pelvic Inflammatory Disease"", which is characterized by pain during urination, excessive vaginal bleeding, abdominal bloating, pelvic organ prolapse, infertility problems, and death from complications of pregnancy. It is important to know that all these symptoms are not necessarily associated with psoriatic plaques.","psoriasis/facial pustular psoriasis \

Psoriasis of the scalp, commonly called psoriasis, is a skin disease characterized by red, itchy lesions that are usually located in the hair follicles. It may also affect other parts of the body and is sometimes referred to as ""headache"". The cause of psoriasis is unknown. In some cases, psoriasis affects only the skin; in others, it can develop on any part of the body. Psoriasis often begins during childhood or adolescence and may last into adulthood. While most people who have psoriasis don't need treatment, many do experience side effects from medications used for psoriasis such as steroids. Because psoriasis affects so many different areas of your body, your doctor may recommend further evaluation if you experience serious side effects. Psoriasis may be associated with other conditions such as diabetes mellitus, thyroid problems, and allergies. The type of psoriasis can vary greatly depending on how much time it has been active. A simple case of psoriasis does not require hospitalization. However, some more severe types of psoriasis may require medical care or surgery. In milder forms of this disease, patients may be able to use home remedies to treat their condition without medication. This may involve using various oils, lotions and creams as well as topical preparations containing zinc oxide or petroleum jelly. Your physician will monitor your progress closely while you try these home remedies.","A hair sample will be taken and the psoriasis areas will be examined. The scalp area will be patted with a cotton swab to remove any dead or damaged skin cells, and then the hair should have been completely dry before testing for psoriatic plaque. A positive result indicates that there are some abnormal cells present in this area.

Q: can a woman with psoriasis be pregnant? Answer: Yes

A: The question was unclear because it did not specify whether the psoriasis is primary or secondary. In general, we will accept a diagnosis of ""primary"" psoriasis if the patient has more than one type of skin lesion (eg, psoriatic arthritis and erythema nodosum) as well as significant weight loss or anorexia nervosa. [3] Secondary psoriasis occurs in about 1% to 5% of patients with psoriasis. Women who have no history of pregnancy are at higher risk for developing secondary psoriasis due to their elevated levels of testosterone.[4]

Question: does this disease affect male reproductive organs? Answer: no

There may be some indirect evidence that psoriasis affects male fertility, but the studies were limited by small sample sizes, lack of control groups, use of different diagnostic criteria, and/or short follow-up periods. For example, in a study conducted among 40 women with chronic plaque psoriasis, none had been pregnant, while all reported being breastfeeding, which suggests there might be a link between psoriasis and reproduction.[5] A case report suggests that steroid supplementation could delay the time to onset of infertility and reduce the severity of psoriasis lesions. However, most women in the study stopped taking steroids after stopping treatment, so further research is needed to confirm these findings.

Question: what is psoralen used for? Answer: psoralens are prescribed for the relief of itching from a variety of causes, including acute flushing reactions such as those seen following exposure to strong irritants. They also are sometimes given for mild cases of generalized rashes like eczema and contact dermatitis associated with allergies (contact urticaria). Patients with severe psoralen side effects include those with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; they must discontinue therapy immediately.[6] Psoralen is a highly effective drug in treating pruritus caused by stinging insects. It works by inhibiting histamine release by mast cells, resulting in decreased itchiness. Although this drug can cause drowsiness, many people report feeling energized after taking it.

Question: how do I stop taking my psoralen? Answer: you should change your medication to another medication that is less likely to cause unwanted side effects. You should also avoid activities that aggravate symptoms such as exercising or sunbathing","psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis

Head Pads can be used as a topical treatment to reduce the itching and inflammation of Psoriasis. It is also suitable for treating the dryness and itching caused by eczema, psoriatic arthritis (RA) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). They are not suitable for the treatment of other skin conditions such as acne, rosacea, lichen sclerosus, hives, psoriasis, fungal infections and other skin diseases. The benefits of using them include:

Psoriasis is usually accompanied by severe itchiness, redness and swelling of the skin, especially around the face, neck and groin areas. This results in frequent scratching and rubbing of the affected area which leads to increased blood flow to this region. In addition, excessive scratching increases the risk of infection due to fungi and bacteria. These are then passed into the body through skin abrasions and wounds.

Pseudofolliculitis is an abnormal accumulation of dead skin cells on the surface of the skin.

Acne can be treated with over-the-counter creams that often contain salicylic acid. However, they have not been shown to be effective against the most common types of acne - nodular, papules and pustules (acne vulgaris), erythematous and mixed comedones (inflammatory acne) and trichotillomania. They do work well in preventing scarring caused by acne and sometimes it is necessary to use more than one type of medication at once. A cream containing 0% salicylic acid has been reported to improve the appearance of scars, but its efficacy for treatment of psoriasis remains unproven. Salicylic acid is a known irritant. It should never be applied directly to any part of the skin except the eye area where it may cause blindness.

The itch caused by psoriasis is worse when the scalp is involved. Hence some people choose to avoid wearing a hat while they are applying a mask.

Some patients prefer to wear hats in bed whilst sleeping because they can relax their muscles during sleep so that pain and itchiness are less likely to occur. The following chart shows the number of patients who said they would change what they wore if they could:

Itchiness/Redness in general: 1/3

Clothes worn in bed: 2/3

Hat worn in bed: 2/3

I do have some questions related to psoriasis that you may be able to help me with. My girlfriend is suffering from this skin disease and she has been seeing several doctors who all have given her the same results (no new treatments). She's very sick, but we just want something different than what the other doctors are offering.

We both have normal skin but there are spots on our heads where our hair grows on certain areas and it seems as if the area of those spots gets more inflamed when we get older. We've tried many products for psoriasis like Neutrogena, and I'm thinking they might work because my friend doesn't seem to have any signs of infection or any irritation (except for acne) even though she's had them for about three years now. Does anyone know if these treatments work?

But, in general, I think the scalp psoriasis is more likely to be psoriatic than dermatitis herpetiformis.

What you're looking for is a very mild-to-moderate papulopustular rash with an underlying cause of skin inflammation (not necessarily an infection). Psoriasis is caused by a number of different bacteria and fungi as well as viruses. In many cases, only one or two of these causes are present at any given time. This means there's never a single cause of psoriasis, but rather several factors acting together. The most common are:

Acne - this is the ""root"" cause of psoriasis, the primary lesion that can occur anywhere along your face. Acne affects up to 40% of adults who have acne, and it is usually not controlled by topical medications. It also often worsens over time, leading some people to believe they just need to use an anti-acne product every day. Acne is also the main reason why people experience severe itching and scaling, which is what we see on our scalp. Antibiotics are frequently prescribed to treat acne, so if there's a bacterial infection underneath your skin's surface, you'll probably feel better after taking antibiotics.

Common sources include sinus infections, eczema, candida and other fungal infections, herpes simplex virus, chicken pox, or Lyme disease. You may also find yourself using over-the-counter medications to relieve symptoms of these conditions.
