1,Q: What are the most common chronic diseases? What effects do chronic diseases have for the society and the individual?\nA:,"The most common conditions affecting people today include heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, and arthritis. Of these, heart disease, which affects about 300 million people worldwide, is the number one killer of both men and women. Diabetes mellitus, which affects about 30-40% of all Americans, accounts for 40% of deaths from heart attacks in young adults (18 to 29). And, more than 10% of American adults suffer from some form of arthritis. Stroke of any type also kills a substantial percentage of individuals annually (5%-10%) and has been estimated that the direct medical costs related to stroke may exceed $200 billion per year. Other common chronic conditions afflicting humans include osteoarthritis, kidney problems, and digestive disorders. \r


In summary, there are many causes of death which affect our daily lives every day, such as smoking, accidents, infections, or even poor diet. These types of deaths make up only a small portion of the total number of human deaths each year. However, they are important because they contribute significantly to increased rates of morbidity and mortality. \r


The major cause of death today is cardiovascular disease, which represents about 50% of deaths caused by infectious agents (such as pneumonia), drugs (especially narcotics), alcohol, suicide, accidents, and trauma. This list could be expanded to include other causes of death; however, the following will suffice. \r

""The majority of studies show that women with CHD have a higher incidence rate for other complications such as coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, myocardial infarction or death from cardiovascular causes. It is believed that these complications may contribute to an increased risk of early mortality in patients with CHD."" [4] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=SCHIZOPHRENIA+and+chronic+diseases&order=H&qtype=abstract \r


This means that women who develop CHD during pregnancy have more than double the risk of dying as women without CHD during pregnancy.[5][6]


In the late 1970s researchers discovered that the hormone progesterone was involved in maintaining blood pressure and that it could be used by the body to control CHD. During the 1980s scientists began using this knowledge to treat pregnant women with CHD. Many doctors felt that they were doing something good because there was some data showing that the progestin had an effect on CHD, however, others felt that their methods were not based on scientific evidence.[7]


What we know about CHD and progesterone treatment has changed significantly since 1973 when Dr. James Yancey first showed that progesterone might help manage CHD. The latest research shows that progesterone does indeed affect blood pressure in people who suffer from hypertension. In fact, it seems that progesterone can lower blood pressure by up to 3/8ths! There are also numerous anecdotal reports of patients experiencing significant improvement in their condition after taking progesterone-containing pills. However, if your doctor recommends you take progesterone pills, make sure she knows what she's talking about; many medical doctors believe that progesterone should only be prescribed for those with a specific genetic mutation associated with high blood pressure, which is called HBP1. If you think you might have HBP1,","\Nourished people in developed countries tend to be healthier than those who lack sufficient food. In developing countries, however, malnutrition is a serious problem with high mortality rates among children under 5 years of age.\pH: 0-10.5\r

\Nourishment also affects how a person functions as he/she ages. A healthy person cannot survive without adequate nutrition, but old or ill people often suffer from symptoms of illness that could be caused by their own poor health. Poor nutrition also has an impact on mental ability and physical condition.\pH: 6.8-7.2\r

""\u201cThe causes of hunger, poverty, undernutrition and other nutritional deficiencies can vary greatly from country to country, region to region, and from one part of the world to another. To some extent, these problems may also reflect differences in the level of technology available to each nation. In this regard, there are many examples where countries which are less dependent upon agriculture (e.g., India, Iran) are able to improve their standards of living through technological innovations such as the use of irrigation and better seed varieties. And countries which have become more technologically advanced (e.g., China) have been able to increase levels of income for their citizens.\pH: 7.3-7.4\r

\u201cIn order for any nation to meet its basic needs, it must first eliminate extreme poverty. The development of agricultural technologies throughout the world is necessary because farmers need tools such as tractors, harvesters, fertilizers and pesticides to grow crops efficiently. However, it is not enough merely to provide farmers with the necessary equipment. Many farmers still rely heavily on local labor and on subsistence farming techniques that require little training. This is especially true in rural areas where families depend on traditional practices and few opportunities exist for learning new skills. Therefore, even if agricultural technology advances have improved yields and productivity, they will not overcome the economic difficulties faced by millions of farmers across the globe.\u2014\u2014 \r


""\u2015\r

To solve the issue of hunger, we must promote universal access to modern farming techniques, education and training. This requires government policies that support sustainable agricultural production systems based on good science rather than tradition, and ensure that all farmers receive equal access to affordable fertilizer and seeds. It also requires governments to establish free and accessible markets that enable private investment in agriculture and ensure fair trade conditions within these markets.","Chronic diseases include diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atherosclerosis, heart disease, stroke, cancer, arthritis, psoriasis, etc. The majority of these diseases affect the body adversely as they result in a slow decline of vitality and health and a loss of happiness. We must consider that our modern lifestyle has caused many people to become sick as a consequence of their poor diet and lack of exercise. Most people are still unaware of how much stress they put on themselves by using electronic devices or watching television programs all day long, as well as by not getting enough rest during their sleep. They often end up feeling tired even though they are not sick or injured. In addition, there is an epidemic of obesity among children and adolescents.

Most adults suffer from one or more chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases (stroke), diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, cancer, etc. \ nA: How will our future look like? Will it be a better or worse place? Is it possible that the world's population will decrease at some point in time due to our increasing use of technology? Are we heading towards another ice age? What about climate change? If so, what can be done about it? How will technology impact society in general? Do you think the environment and food quality will continue to deteriorate over the next few decades? \nA: It's unlikely that human beings will survive the coming generations without significant changes being made in the way we live. One of the key aspects of this transformation will be the rapid improvement of medical care and prevention of environmental problems. This will depend upon the development of new drugs, vaccines, devices, techniques, etc., which will also require fundamental research in medicine. These developments should lead to major advances in longevity, the ability to reverse aging and greatly reduce the likelihood of suffering from various types of illnesses. The same technologies could save billions of lives through preventative measures which would allow us to extend life expectancy considerably beyond today's levels. In addition, advances in artificial intelligence will make possible the creation of living computers with unprecedented capabilities. Eventually, our descendants may develop super intelligent robots to assist them throughout their whole lifetime. However, the first generation robots may provide assistance only if our species decides to cooperate. For example, to overcome conflicts between humans and other animals or between nations we might create robot companions who don't kill when necessary, but instead act as ambassadors for peace and cooperation between peoples, countries or races, thus promoting peace among humanity as a whole. \","The best known chronic diseases include coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cancer, asthma and many others. In recent times there has been a great deal of interest in finding ways to prevent or control these chronic illnesses. However, even though there is some evidence that preventive actions can be beneficial, it appears unlikely that they will have any long term effect on our population over the next century (1). CVD mortality rates continue to increase, particularly among middle aged people who are not yet at risk, although this trend is moderated by economic development and other factors (2), thus suggesting that we need to find a way of preventing premature death. Smoking remains one of the greatest contributors to cardiovascular disease, and smoking cessation is an important strategy for reducing mortality from all causes. There are also significant health benefits from consuming whole grains, vegetables and fruit, including lower incidence of colorectal cancer, stroke and dementia (3). This review examines the potential risks associated with chronic diseases and focuses especially on what these diseases mean for individual's well-being.\r

Q: How much money does one need to save for retirement? What is your personal saving rate?\nA: Saving for retirement is not as easy as you might think. You should put aside 30% or so of your total salary every year in an Individual Pension Scheme (IPP) in order to have enough funds at hand to retire comfortably and enjoy life. An average middle-class Indian earns Rs 65,000 per month after tax; so a pension plan would mean that he/she will receive around Rs 18 lakh annually. This is just an example - this figure varies depending on how much you earn each month.\r


Q: Who contributes to Individual Public Provident Fund(IPPF)? Why do people contribute to it?\nA: IPPF was introduced when India had a GDP of Rs 3 trillion. While most Indians earn less than Rs 2 lakh per annum from their jobs, some earn nearly twice that amount. To help them make ends meet, the government decided to set up a system where citizens who earn under Rs 20,000 per annum could set up an Individual Public Service Plan (IPPPS), which means they would provide services like health care and education without having to pay extra fees. There are many such plans available across the country.\r


Q: Is there anything else I can do if my savings aren't sufficient?\nA: Most Indian employees only invest part of their earnings into a pension fund. So even if you start off with 10% saved, you may end up with less than 5%. The best thing you can do is take advantage of a financial advisor who is well trained in all things pertaining to IRAs. They can advise you about what assets to hold in your 401(k).

The most common chronic disease is hypertension (high blood pressure), which affects nearly 25 million Indians, including about 16 million adults. The incidence rate of hypertension among children has declined from 3% to 2%, but in adults it has remained at 20%. Diabetes mellitus accounts for 1.2 million new cases each year and causes an estimated $16 billion loss annually. It also leads to a significant burden on healthcare system resources (HIV/AIDS alone costs Rs 21,000 crore every year). Other common chronic diseases include heart failure (1.8 million people); cancer (9.3 million); liver cirrhosis (7 million); stroke (6.5 million); Alzheimer's disease (4.5 million); pneumonia (2.2 million) and tuberculosis (2.1 million). The average life expectancy is 73 years, and half of all men will die before they reach 65 years. \r


Q: Why is India spending so much money on health care when its population is growing rapidly?\nA: In 2002, total public expenditure was 8.77% of the Gross Domestic Product. This is the highest proportion since 1979. The share of GDP devoted to health increased steadily between 1983 and 1992 while the overall increase in healthcare expenditure came mostly from increases in the private sector. However, since 2004, when the government assumed responsibility for universal primary health coverage, public expenditure has been falling behind the growth in the economy because of rising inflation. As a result, the percentage spent per capita has fallen from 9.3% in 2003 to 7.4% in 2009. Public funding continues to be inadequate, with only 27.5% of Indians having access to quality services such as free medicines and diagnostic tests. Although government schemes cover some basic services, there remain wide disparities between states with little coherence or efficiency. Private providers provide less than 10% of primary health care; however, many low-income patients do not know that this is possible. A lack of awareness about available options limits cost effectiveness, particularly for those who cannot afford long-term medical treatment. Some believe that underfunding of health insurance makes it difficult for poorer families to secure comprehensive health protection against disease. Most poor households are not covered by any health insurance policy, although state governments guarantee them subsidies for their elderly and disabled family members (see http://www.mfa.gov.in/healthcarecost/index_t06.htm ). Q: How does India compare with other countries in","The most prevalent causes of death in China include cardiovascular disease, respiratory disorders (such as tuberculosis), stroke, diabetes mellitus, infectious diseases (including HIV/AIDS) and cerebrovascular disease. Chronic diseases account for 25 percent to 30 percent of deaths every year in China. According to the National Health and Family Planning Commission, nearly 300 million people across the country suffer from some form of chronic disease at any given time. The majority of these patients are under-aged or elderly and do not receive adequate medical treatment.

1. What does the term'social insurance' mean? Social security is an insurance program for social welfare purposes that was established by the government as early as the Qing dynasty (1644-1911). It has been implemented since then under different names like civil service pension scheme, military service pension, agricultural workers benefit, public employees benefits, disaster relief plan, etc. A national health insurance scheme that covers all citizens aged 18 years and older, including individuals with disabilities; provides treatment for non-economic ailments which includes but is not limited to mental illness, cancer, heart attack, stroke, paralysis and other serious illnesses, and pays medical bills; and provide financial assistance to people who need it, such as old age assistance, maternity leave, unemployment compensation, education subsidy, disability allowance, family planning funds, and so forth, has been implemented through various programs over the past decades. These programs have resulted in rapid economic growth. They have also contributed significantly towards improving social harmony, and have helped improve China's standard of living and quality of life. In recent years, though, many citizens have complained about excessive expenses and lack of adequate services provided by social welfare agencies. As a result of these complaints, the government introduced a number of measures aimed at ensuring universal coverage. Some examples of these measures are the expansion of coverage, strengthening of the basic coverage structure, setting up of new insurance products and restructuring of existing ones. Also, a reform of the administrative personnel within these departments has recently taken place, creating opportunities to recruit talented personnel and ensure improved efficiency in handling operations. Over the next few years, China will introduce more","Chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, asthma, stroke etc. all lead to a loss of life due to complications and disability caused by them and can cause premature death due to various medical problems.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified chronic diseases into four broad categories, based on their impact on health-related quality of life or overall health status, with ""high"" risk of serious morbidity or mortality, ""low risk"", ""medium risk"" and ""low risk"". These categories reflect the prevalence of health conditions that significantly affect people's physical and mental well being and therefore contribute to their welfare in terms of economic productivity. The WHO classifies chronic diseases according to several factors, including underlying causes, genetic susceptibility, etiology, incidence patterns, prognosis, treatment strategies, cost effectiveness, public health impact, and global burden of disease estimates.


CVD (chronic heart disease): There were 6.5 million deaths from CVD globally in 2012 and this number is projected to rise sharply by 2030, with an estimated 1.2 billion people at high risk of suffering from CVD in 2050. By the year 2100, there will be 10.6% more people living with CVD than today in low income countries alone. Heart attacks are the main type of CVD causing approximately half of all deaths worldwide, while strokes account for another one third, and pulmonary embolism accounts for two thirds. A combination of factors contributes to CVD in developing nations, such as poverty, lack of access to healthcare and poor diet, and its highest rates occur in Asia, Africa and Latin America. This is particularly important when considering that the world population is growing faster than the average rate of increase of these regions and some populations could face a doubling of their age cohorts within decades. As a result of increased longevity, it is predicted that the burden from CVD will continue to grow over time.

Chronic liver disease: In 2010, the number of deaths from acute hepatitis B was estimated to reach 843 000 globally, accounting for 11% of total deaths due to infectious diseases. Although there is no specific estimate available for acute hepatitis C, around 20 000 new cases occur each year. It is estimated that one person dies every nine minutes from cirrhosis or related liver disorders in developing countries – nearly three times the amount of deaths per person that would occur if only 10% of those who die from cancer had liver disease. These diseases also pose a huge financial burden, especially because they can require complex treatment and long hospital stays","Chronic diseases are those that occur with long-term or continuous existence. The body is able to heal itself, but it is unable to stay in good condition at all times and will eventually break down completely. This is a result of our genetics which dictates how much we can take from the environment when given enough time. We are also affected by other factors such as environmental toxins, stress, and overwork, and these often lead to some form of chronic disease in which a person's genes dictate their physical condition and susceptibility to disease.

Q: How does chronic pain affect your life?\nA: Pain is an inevitable part of life. However, it is not necessarily bad if you manage it properly and learn the skills required to avoid it entirely. Some people, however, get caught up in pain and become addicted to it which can cause them to neglect their work or their relationships. For example, many people suffer from insomnia because they wake up constantly in excruciating pain. Others may be plagued by poor eating habits due to frequent stomach aches; some people find themselves spending hours every day driving around in circles looking for parking spaces! In addition, chronic pain affects both mental health and physical health. It causes people suffering from depression to feel worthless and hopeless, leading to suicide attempts. In contrast, healthy individuals rarely experience this level of emotional distress (i.e., sadness). Therefore, there are some ways that one can prevent chronic pain by managing one's diet, exercise, and sleep habits so that one doesn't run into it in the first place.

Q: Why should I care about my health?\nA: Everyone has a basic human right to live without experiencing any type of harm or discomfort. Even the slightest bit of damage to the body will greatly diminish the quality of life a person has experienced thus far. That being said, everyone's needs differ slightly so knowing the difference between what is necessary and unnecessary is crucial in helping one determine if he/she truly wants to go through with a certain task. The following questions and answers will help you determine if you need to undertake a particular activity and what your options would be if you decide to make it happen.

1. Does it benefit me personally? \nA: Without question, yes. If you're going to die soon, then doing something helps to ease the impending doom. Whether it involves getting up, going out, exercising, etc., making yourself walk, sit, eat, etc. can lessen the pain of losing someone dear to you. On top"

For those who have never used one, the app is a lot like using an iPhone — you've got your home screen, with all your favorite apps and their icons; the left side of the screen has quick access to the settings; and on the right side is the main menu (with a handy search function). You can swipe from any icon in that menu to open it up for more information or look around a bit before hitting the back button. If you're looking at the top of the main menu, you'll see options to add new accounts, sign into an account, get support, download the latest version of the app, and even change the wallpaper. To help make it easier to find these things, each option includes a shortcut to the page of related info. For example, when you tap ""add"" on the bottom left of the main menu, you'll immediately be taken to Account Settings if there's one available — otherwise, just go straight to Add Account. The app also lets you import accounts into the OneNote app so you won't need to sync your devices again.

The rest of the app looks very much like other OneNote users expect it to look; everything is organized and accessible via swipes down from the top of the screen and upward toward the bottom. There are several categories, including your notebooks, notes, calendar items, reminders, images, audio files, videos, photos, voice memos, text messages, and documents. In addition, each category has its own sub-categories that let you sort your content by date added/deleted/viewed/read.

There's no clear way to filter through these categories, but I'm happy with what I found; a few times, a note would show up as a reminder for something else I was working on but I didn't want to bother going back to it to pick up where I'd left off; this wasn't really an issue, though, because the categories themselves weren't particularly cluttered.

To create new notebooks, you simply drag a photo from your Camera Roll onto the blank space below the name. Notebooks created in OneNote aren't automatically saved across devices, nor are they stored locally on the device itself. Instead, once you save them in OneNote, they remain synchronized between your devices until you delete them — which means there's only ever one notebook per device. But then, you don't necessarily always have to keep separate copies of your notebooks and OneNote syncing saves them","nA

2) ""The Daily Activity App,"" by Mark Williams, is the only app with a health section. It's designed to help you stay motivated through your day. The app helps you track and quantify how much sleep you get each night (if you don't get enough, you can use it as an alarm clock!), which helps you adjust your sleeping patterns to suit your needs. If you have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, this may be something you'd like to keep in mind. You can also set goals for when you want to go to bed so that you won't be too late. And if you're getting up early on a weekday morning, you'll find that you wake up earlier and more rested! I especially love the fact that you can set different activities for specific days of the week. For instance, I will try to do some walking and running during my lunch break when the gym isn't open but I'm not exercising at all. This way I can still eat healthy and get protein from foods I enjoy without being punished. I guess I could also include a workout routine too but then I wouldn't need to worry about the calories and calories out (which is quite important!).

I used the app the first time I started tracking my physical activity. Now I can't imagine my life without it. I see myself using it every day (except weekends), except when I'm doing chores around the house. 🙂

#3 – ""Strava."" This free online fitness tool was created by Strava and offers unlimited access to its data for those who sign up via their website. To begin logging, simply type in what exercise you are going to do and where you are going to do it. You can even check the weather forecast! This is where you can actually look at other athletes' rides if they are participating in them on Strava. As I mentioned before, the real magic happens when you start comparing yourself against other riders! When you become better than everyone else in your area, you can challenge your friends to ride with you! There are various training categories such as cycling (sprints), running (marathons), hiking (mountain biking), and triathlon/speed skating. Each sport has its own ranking system based on a number of factors including speed, endurance, distance, and elevation gain. Once you've completed a certain amount of the training category you choose, you can purchase a paid account that gives you access to the next level of training.

22,Q: my risk for developing type 2 diabetes\nA:,"no, I'm not diabetic but if you were to ask me that question I would say yes (3/20)

Answer: You are very unlikely to develop diabetes. The reason is due to an enzyme called glucokinase in your pancreas which breaks down dietary carbohydrates and converts them into glucose in the bloodstream so as to provide energy for your body. If this enzyme was missing or damaged it could lead to high blood sugar levels which can be dangerous. However, there are many other factors which can also contribute to diabetes such as obesity and a poor diet. It's important to keep up with your daily exercise routine and have good eating habits, not only do they help to control your weight and cholesterol levels but will also reduce the chances of developing diabetes. (4/20)

Q: I feel sluggish all day long, what should I eat? A: Your metabolism is slowing down and thus your hunger level rises. This is due to how many calories you consume each day, your body is still working hard to burn off those calories. Eating more will only make you hungrier and less likely to lose any weight because now your body has fewer resources left to work with. There may also be some chemical imbalances occurring inside your body because these changes affect hormones like leptin and ghrelin which determine how much food you need to take in in order to feel full. As well, you may find that when you eat fatty foods you feel hungry sooner than when you eat starchy foods, so you might want to cut back on your intake of fats and sugars (such as white bread). (5/20)

Q: My belly feels bloated after meals and I don't know why? A: If your stomach doesn't empty properly then your intestines will continue to function normally but your bowels won't. When your bowels aren't functioning normally then they become blocked and this blockage causes a feeling of fullness. When your gut is blocked the body tries to remove waste products from your system by passing urine through your skin. If you experience this sensation then you've got to let your bowels out regularly - even just once every four hours is better than letting them sit and cause discomfort. Many people have discovered that their tummy gets flatter if they wait until they're finished eating before flushing the toilet. Make sure you flush your bowels at least every couple of minutes while you're eating, as otherwise your bowels may stay blocked longer which will increase your chance of having bowel problems later.","I take statins and/or beta blockers to control my blood sugar.

Q: how long do you think your time with the programme will last?A: My appointment is scheduled for December 23rd, but if I don't get it today, I'll have to wait until January or February.

Q: why did you decide to join the programme?A: One of my colleagues told me about a free course that I could take to learn more about chronic disease prevention. She said there was no way I would get this opportunity on my own.

Q: what's been the best thing so far about the programme?A: It has provided me an excuse not to be working and having fun anymore! I'm going back to work on the weekends now!

Q: What are the challenges in staying motivated while taking part in the programme?A: The biggest challenge is that I've already decided how many days of the week I'm going to participate. Since we started the program, I haven't had any days off, which makes it difficult to motivate myself! But since my first day, I am feeling stronger, more focused, and less stressed than ever before. I also love the community around us - we're all learning together, helping each other out, making new friends every single day! (Thanks again for everything!)

I'm currently looking forward to getting my hands dirty during our weekly team practice sessions (Wednesday through Sunday)","not good or very bad

Dietary fiber is an important component of a healthy diet. The American Diabetes Association recommends that individuals consume at least 10-15 grams of dietary fiber per day, which can be obtained in many different ways, including from fruits and vegetables. Fiber plays many roles in the body, such as helping to maintain bowel regularity, preventing constipation, providing energy to support strong bones, supporting proper blood sugar levels, and helping with weight management and maintaining a stable weight (1). In addition to serving as a source of fiber, fruits and vegetables are also rich sources of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, phytochemicals, and other nutrients. Fruits and vegetables contain numerous bioactive compounds, most notably lycopene, β-carotene, vitamin C, zinc, folate, lutein, zeaxanthin, anthocyanins, flavonoids, and polyphenols (2). A study published in 2009 found that eating a diet high in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables significantly reduced the risk of developing diabetes by 27% compared to people who ate a low-fiber diet (3). Whole grains are a complete food consisting of complex carbohydrates that are easily digested and absorbed (4) and include wheat bran, oat groats, barley flour, rye flour, cornmeal, oats, amaranth seed kernels, millet, sorghum, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, and sesame seeds. Fruit juices have no calories and provide many of the same beneficial effects as whole fruit. However, they may vary slightly from one variety to another because some varieties are naturally sweetened and others are not. Foods like apples, pears, oranges, bananas, grapes, blueberries, peaches, plums, and papaya are all excellent choices for reducing your risk of becoming diabetic if you limit yourself to two servings a week (5). There is limited evidence on whether or not consuming more than four servings a day of fruits and vegetables reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Researchers did find, however, that a higher intake of fruits and vegetables was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations in overweight women (6), but further research is needed before we can say that this provides any additional health benefits. For example, these findings do not prove that each serving of fruit or vegetable is better for reducing insulin resistance than any other portion size. It would take several years of well-designed studies to determine how much fruit and vegetables help reduce diabetes risk (7). Bottom Line:","yes.

B: I'll drink less sugar, which will help prevent it from developing.

C: No comment

D: no comment

F: you don't have to answer my question. If you are taking any medication or if your body is not healthy, then this may be a factor in your response (yes/no)


6: If a person is overweight, and has been on treatment for 10 years, how many calories do they consume daily?

a: about 1200-1500

7: Do the subjects who eat a lot of foods like potatoes, rice, pasta, meat and dairy products, have problems with their blood glucose levels? How about people who eat less processed foods, including fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds?

a: Yes, it's probably because they're eating too much of the wrong things.

b: Yes

c: Maybe, maybe not. It depends on their individual situation.

d: I'd say probably, unless you've had diabetes for 30+ years.

e: No, no one has ever reported an increase in their BG level while following an Atkins diet.

f: Not really. The majority of diabetics report the same BG level as before the diet started.

g: Absolutely not. Diabetes doesn't cause blood sugar spikes. Blood sugars go up naturally during exercise or when you gain weight or lose weight.


8: Are there studies that demonstrate an increase in blood glucose after the Atkins diet? What other tests were used? Did these results change over time?

a: Some of them did show a slight decrease in BG but this didn't last long enough to prove anything significant. They would need more data to make a definitive statement. For example, one study showed a small decrease in fasting blood glucose, and another showed no difference between diets.

b: There are some reports of a minor decrease in fasting blood glucose with an Atkins Diet, though some people still","the rate of developing type 2 diabetes.

What is the role of omega-3 fatty acids in obesity?

Omega-3s are found primarily in fish, so a diet that excludes fish and includes animal foods can be an effective way to reduce the level of omega-3 fat consumption in the body. This may help prevent or delay the onset of metabolic syndrome and other diseases associated with the development of chronic inflammation, such as atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).


Dietary supplements containing alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) have also been shown in some studies to lower triglyceride levels in both healthy individuals and those who had recently developed heart disease. ALA has also been shown to lower blood pressure. A supplement containing 800 mg of ALA each day was studied in overweight women after they were advised to avoid animal foods. The dietary intervention resulted in significant weight loss but did not affect fasting blood sugar levels. After one year, HDL cholesterol increased by 3% and LDL cholesterol decreased by 5%. However, no change occurred in triglycerides, which remained unchanged in these women. At the conclusion of this study, it was concluded that omega-3 fatty acids could be considered to protect against cardiovascular disease when combined with a low carbohydrate diet. These findings support further investigation into the potential benefits of ALA supplementation.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease characterized by insulin resistance and associated with morbidity, mortality, and reduced quality of life. The prevalence of DM has increased substantially worldwide over recent decades; it now affects about 1 in 5 adults, with more than 150 million people living with this condition.1-3 In many countries, the prevalence of DM has reached epidemic proportions, resulting in an estimated 3.6 billion cases annually, or 1 in 8 persons worldwide.4 To date, there is no consensus on how best to manage DM.2 However, these issues are not new. Several decades ago, physicians recognized that, when treating patients with certain types of DM, they should avoid treatment if their blood glucose levels were too low for diabetic control or if the patient was unable to monitor his/her own blood glucose level accurately.5,6 However, in those situations where patients were able to take their blood glucose level with them, there was still a need for management strategies to maintain appropriate glucose control.7 More recently, more research has focused on understanding the factors that predispose individuals to develop diabetes, including genetic susceptibility8-10 and environmental influences such as diet11-15 and lifestyle choices such as obesity16-18. Because so many factors contribute to the development of DM, effective management of DM requires multiple approaches. The aim of this editorial is to provide current information about the relationship between diabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). We also address questions surrounding the potential benefits of weight loss interventions for DM and CVD prevention.

Type II Diabetes Mellitus Type II DM is defined according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF)/World Health Organization criteria as one which occurs due to either noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), acquired pre-diabetes (APD), or both NIDDM and APD.19 A diagnosis of diabetes can be confirmed by HbA 1c,20 fasting plasma glucose,21-23 or use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents.24 Some researchers have suggested that only 1% of NIDDM is associated with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), while up to 15% of NIDDM is related to hyperglycemia; 25 however, other investigators have questioned whether these differences would result in meaningful differences in outcomes between NIDDM and APD.26-28 Despite debate regarding the clinical significance of NIDDM, its etiology remains the same across all major","no

I think it's fair to say that these questions are a bit more complex than they appear at first glance. The answer you get from your doctor is likely going to depend on your age and whether or not you have a family history of the disease. For example, if you have any other kind of diabetes (e.g., gestational diabetes) then your response will be different, as will yours for anyone else in your family. If you're over 65, it's likely that you'll have fewer problems with high blood sugar and less risk of complications such as heart attacks and strokes. That said, even people who are genetically predisposed to diabetes may still develop this condition in their later years, and some people can become diabetic without ever having had symptoms. It just means there are many variables involved in determining a person's risk.

So how do you know what your risk is? Here's how I've done it so far. In October 2006, I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and became very aware of all the potential pitfalls, including those outlined above. To help me make sense of my situation, I consulted two of the best scientists in the world – Drs. Michael Graedon (NHS Blood Pressure Clinic) and Peter Reuter (University College London Diabetes Centre), both highly qualified experts in the field. At their urging, I went through a complete medical screening process and found out which medications I'd been taking and whether I was currently exercising regularly, eating healthily and maintaining a healthy weight. When I checked off each item, I felt reassured about the possibility that I could manage my disease. And yet, just days before Christmas last year, when my blood sugars were higher than normal after consuming an apple-filled lunch, I decided I didn't want to continue being a slave to them. So I changed my diet, exercised more often, got rid of most carbohydrates and switched to a low-glycaemic index food plan. And since then, things have improved dramatically!

The first thing I did was check my blood glucose levels. They were already starting to go up after breakfast but were dropping again by midafternoon, around 5pm. At 6pm, they jumped back up towards the normal range. My initial fear was that my low-glucose diets were causing me to enter ketosis, where your body becomes adapted to burning fat instead of carbs. But this wasn't happening.","I'm at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than the average person, but I don't know how much.

B: Do you have any other health concerns?

A: My sleep apnea is a real concern. The best thing would be to take some medication that will reduce your breathing rate and keep me from collapsing in bed. But I've had good success with taking two medications at once. They can help me stay awake when I need it most.


Q: what is your current weight or height?

A: 55 years old, 5'2"" tall, 120 lbs

Q: Why do you exercise?

A: To maintain my health. To feel better after having a stressful day. A long walk or run helps me relax. And since losing weight has been so challenging, I enjoy working out on an empty stomach because then I get an extra boost of energy to make it through another day.


Q: What are your typical meals/snacks?

A: Some days, eggs, cheese, crackers, chicken thighs and/or tuna salad; other days fish, salads and vegetables; sometimes pizza, pasta and steak.

I also like to eat whole grain breads and cereals before and between workouts.


Q: How often do you go to the gym?

A: Sometimes 3-4 times per week, usually more if I'm feeling particularly motivated.

Some people may find that going to the gym three to four times per week causes them to gain weight, but for me this hasn't happened, but I'm trying to change that!","n = 23\

The study was a cross-sectional design, with participants being recruited from the community. The participants were not randomised to receive either intervention or control treatments; instead, they received an education package and a standard healthcare screening questionnaire before baseline (the first observation of which was in 2004). Participants who did not return for follow up were excluded from analysis. Data collection took place at both the baseline and post-baseline stages of the study.

We used the self-reported height and weight as described previously. 17, 18 Briefly, we asked each participant whether they had ever been told their height or weight was below normal or above average, and asked them if they knew someone else who felt this way. We also asked the age-and gender-matched comparison group how often they were aware that their own BMI was underweight (0%), overweight (1%) or obese (2%). When the answer was yes, we compared body mass index values between these groups using linear regression analysis. This enabled us to assess the relationship between BMI (in kg/m 2 ) and other measured characteristics across the entire range of BMI (<18.5), over three categories of obesity (>25% BF) and ≥30%. Weight was also measured at baseline, with a calibrated scale; BMI was calculated using the following formula: weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. Height was measured in centimeters. BMI is the most commonly used measure of adiposity globally. 18

To investigate the potential impact of different interventions on physical activity, we analysed all data including those collected at the two pre-treatment visits (2004–2005 and 2006–2007). To provide evidence about the impact of our interventions on dietary behaviours and nutrient intakes, we assessed total energy intake and macronutrient composition from both the clinic and home scales during the same two periods (2006–2007 and 2010–2011). At baseline, participants were instructed to complete a short online survey on food and exercise habits. This questionaire included questions on usual diet, consumption of specific foods, time spent at rest, activities undertaken while travelling, and the level of physical exertion required to undertake particular activities.

At baseline, participants completed a detailed medical history form and underwent comprehensive blood measurements. After a 24 h fast, they returned for follow-up examination after 3 months. At this visit, participants provided informed written consent to participate in the clinical trial. Participants who refused to take part were invited to return within 6 weeks.

35,Q: Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?\nA:,"Yes. A ketogenic diet is the recommended way to manage Type 1 diabetes in adults and children with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes, but it can be used by anyone who has diabetes regardless of their glucose level or insulin requirement. It is also safe for those with diabetic kidney disease.

Ketosis: What Is The Benefit Of Ketones For Diabetes? Ketone bodies are produced during fasting (or if you're eating low carb) as your body breaks down fat stores so that more energy can enter your cells and muscles. Since there's not much sugar circulating in our blood at this time, we use up some glucose reserves as fuel. Once all of the glucose has been metabolized, however, we need to get rid of any excess glycogen (stored carbohydrate) because there isn't enough available to power us through our day. However, since the liver will try to store any glucose you have stored, we don't want to burn off too many calories. By burning fat instead, we'll release ketones into our bloodstream which, according to the National Institutes of Health's ""Diabetes Prevention Program"" report, ""will boost energy levels, help control weight gain, and reduce inflammation."" In fact, Dr. John McDougall recommends using an oral glucose tolerance test after four weeks of using ketosis in his book ""The China Study,"" which showed that the improved health and decreased risk of heart disease were the result of the ketones and not the reduction of carbohydrates. You may hear claims that ketones cause headaches and nausea in diabetics; however, studies show that these symptoms disappear once they've gone away on their own. When ketones are elevated in the blood, there are two primary ways in which they contribute to improving one's health: Reducing insulin sensitivity – As discussed above, increasing ketones helps increase insulin sensitivity and therefore reduces blood glucose levels. Therefore, reducing or eliminating sugars from our diets could potentially lower our chances of developing high blood pressure, type II diabetes, stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, cancer, arthritis, fibromyalgia, arthritis pain, muscle cramps, joint stiffness, sleep disorders, brain fog, memory loss, lack of concentration, and mood swings.

If you are willing to take on more than just the carbohydrates then it will be a great idea to get an insulin pump or have your blood sugar monitored closely.

I've been following this diet now for over two years and I'm still at my weight of 195 pounds (in August 2011). I did a test in early November that showed that I am getting about 12-13 grams/day of carbs from all sources – not including my morning coffee and breakfast burrito. The last time I measured my blood glucose was 3 weeks ago – and since then, I haven't had any problems. In fact, since eating less, I got about 20% better.

What should I watch out for during a ketogenic / keto diet?

The key point here is not to worry too much if you experience any side effects, even those that don't last very long. It's best to see an experienced dietitian (or physician) before making any changes in your diet. Side effects such as headaches and fatigue are common when low carbohydrate diets are changed, but usually subside within 2 months and are not considered dangerous. For many people, these issues do not appear until the end of the first month and they tend to resolve themselves without intervention. Some people find that their hair becomes thinner. This is due to the increased amount of water that is lost during a fast. As well, it's possible to develop other health conditions as a result of a low carb or keto lifestyle, so always consult your doctor if you notice anything unusual.

In addition to these short term health concerns, there are also longer-term consequences to the high fat diet you are following. Your brain will continue to use up glucose from fatty tissues until you're able to burn protein sparingly. In time, your brain cells may start to shrink. Eventually, though, you'll get used to it – and the weight loss will stop!","Not necessarily. People with type 1 and 2 diabetes can benefit from the benefits of ketosis, but it is important to keep in mind that there are several limitations. First, this lifestyle must be followed by a diabetic control program. Second, these diets can cause severe weight loss and changes in blood glucose levels. Third, it should be noted that these diets do not work well if one does not have enough carbohydrates or protein, which are required by the body.

Thanks,

-JOE","Yes. The dietary plan proposed by Dr. Atkins and adopted by many athletes is good for people with diabetes because it provides adequate amounts of essential fatty acids, protein and carbohydrates to provide an energy source that doesn't result in excess weight gain or high blood glucose levels. It also eliminates the need for insulin injections and/or diabetic medications. For those who have difficulty keeping the diet low enough to allow sufficient calories from fat, a diet higher in carbohydrate (about 40-45%) may be more appropriate. This allows greater body fat storage and allows for a slower rate of fat loss than if all calories were from fats and proteins. However, ketosis can be achieved on a low carb diet even when the person does not use any medication. A very healthy adult should aim for a carbohydrate intake of no more than 20% of daily calorie needs; however, a few weeks before starting the diet, the amount should be reduced so as not to put undue stress on the kidneys.

Ketosis

Ketones are produced during starvation and the rapid oxidation of fat. They are used by the brain to metabolize carbs, which leads to feelings of satiety, but they become toxic at high levels, resulting in symptoms such as headaches, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, cramping, anxiety, irritability and depression. Ketone bodies in the urine can indicate an infection, especially in infants and children and in cases of cancer treatment. Some studies show that chronic ketosis results in increased brain metabolism in nonobese patients.

Breathing Rate

The breathing rate is affected by several factors including the air volume, the temperature, heart rate, muscular tension, airway resistance and the presence of obstructive lung disease or pneumonia. The higher the oxygen content of the air, the faster the heart beats (oxygen consumption). Oxygen is needed for the respiratory system to function properly and is critical for healthy cardiovascular functions. If the oxygen supply is compromised, the body's metabolism slows down, leading to exhaustion and lethargy. Higher breaths per minute increase the risk of dying from hypoxia. Breathe slowly and deeply into your diaphragm for three breaths, then hold them for ten seconds. Repeat this every five minutes for one hour until you feel better.

In case you find yourself getting exhausted while using this method, try breathing through both nostrils while standing up. In this way, you will maintain a constant flow of oxygen throughout your lungs.

Caffeine

It has been found that caffeine","Absolutely.

When we look at the history of diabetics, it's clear that they have been eating some kind of carbohydrate-based food to manage their blood sugar levels (even if it was just sugar). For instance, during World War II, diabetics were encouraged by physicians to eat whole grains and legumes and avoid carbohydrates in general. In fact, as late as the 1970s when a major study showed that low carb diets worked better than high carbs (and also showed that most diabetic patients don't respond well to either type of diet), doctors still recommended them. And since then, it has become more common to recommend low carb over the past several decades.

However, research shows that even on these very restrictive diets, many diabetics will eventually develop type 2 diabetes. This is because, although insulin sensitivity improves significantly on lower carb or no carb diets, once you go below 60 grams per day of carbohydrates, your cells actually begin to use glucose to create energy instead of fat – leading to hyperglycemia. Since type 2 diabetes occurs when glucose can't be used for fuel, this means the body needs an additional source of glucose to keep itself functioning properly. This extra glucose comes from the foods we ate before we started our carb restriction! When we restrict carbs, this extra glucose is stored in adipose tissue (fat) and liver where it creates fat storage. This results in a vicious cycle, making it difficult for people to lose weight while reducing their risk for developing type 2 diabetes. So how do we reverse this process?

In recent years there has been a huge rise in interest in using intermittent fasting to reverse type 2 diabetes. Many experts believe that intermittent fasting is not only safe but may actually help reduce or eliminate diabetes altogether! One of the biggest problems associated with Type 2 Diabetes is oxidative stress. The key point here is that insulin resistance causes oxidative stress and insulin promotes antioxidant defense against free radicals. Therefore, when we get into a metabolic state where antioxidants are lowered due to insulin resistance, we are less able to fight off free radicals which leads us to build up excessive amounts of oxidative damage to our tissues. Even though dietary carbs typically promote healthy lipid profiles and cholesterol, they also increase free radical production so this could potentially lead to increased triglycerides, LDL and HDL particles.

By removing carbohydrates for longer periods of time (e.g., 24 hours) we can turn down inflammation while simultaneously boosting antioxidants to prevent further damage. As long as we're keeping protein intake moderate (~45 g/","A ketogenic or low carb diet is generally considered to be appropriate in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis and certain other conditions. In general, this type of diet involves eating less than 50% of your calories from carbohydrates. If you have type 1 diabetes or prediabetes then you may find that some ketogenic diets are not suitable because the high levels of insulin can cause blood sugar levels to drop too quickly (hyperglycemia). Because of this, it's important to follow a strict diet. Some experts recommend a 20-30% carbohydrate deficit (with more if you have pre-diabetes) although it must be noted that most people who follow this diet do so on a very low calorie intake – around 1500 kcal per day is typical.

What's The Bottom Line On Keto Diets For Type 1 Diabetics?

It seems like I've only covered one side of this story here! If anyone has any questions about whether or not an alternate form of food is better suited for their diabetes symptoms then please leave a comment below. As always, let me know what you think!","Yes, it is. The ketogenic / keto diet is an effective way of controlling blood glucose levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although the exact mechanism behind this effect isn't well understood, research suggests that it has to do with insulin resistance and increased lipolysis, which leads to decreased production of fatty acids (i.e. adipose tissue) from fat cells. This decrease in lipid synthesis and storage also reduces the amount of triglycerides that are stored in peripheral tissues as well. It may also be the case that by increasing glucose disposal in muscle, the beta-oxidation process occurs more effectively and efficiently, leading to less oxidative stress on the liver or skeletal muscles.[4]


Source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22682971","Yes. It is generally considered safe and effective, even though there are some potential side effects. There is no evidence of long-term metabolic damage in most cases (though it can affect the pancreas). \nB: A low carb/high fat diet is more suitable for diabetics than a high carbohydrate/low fat diet.\nC: Ketones may be used to treat type 2 diabetes, but they have little effect on the body's ability to use glucose as an energy source. They do not cause hypoglycemia, which is usually caused by insulin resistance. There is also limited research into how they might change blood lipid levels or cholesterol profiles.

What About My Kidneys?

Many doctors recommend that if you want to lose weight you try to avoid protein in your diet and instead focus on whole foods like meat, fish, eggs, fruits, vegetables, nuts etc… There are several reasons why this works better than just cutting out proteins. If anything is being cut out then it will slow down digestion so your kidneys can process less of these nutrients. The other reason is simply that your body needs them (especially when your blood sugar level drops) and if you don't get enough of them from animal products, plants, legumes, etc.. then your kidneys will not function optimally. There is research showing that protein does indeed stimulate urination and thereby improves kidney health.


Is Ketosis the Same as Ketoacidosis?

The difference between ketogenesis and ketoacidosis is one of definition. Ketogenesis refers to the breakdown of fatty acids in the liver as a result of starvation, while ketoacidosis refers to the buildup of ketone bodies in the bloodstream. However both can happen at the same time. It has been shown in mice that very short term fasting causes rapid changes in brain structure and activity, similar to those seen during a diabetic coma. This suggests that ketosis can lead to ketoacidosis if prolonged. Also, it has been shown in rats that long periods of low carbohydrate intake can produce excessive ketones, which is what we experience in ketoacidosis.

Do I Have To Eat Only Fatty Meats For Low Carb?

No! You don't need to eat only fats and oils. We actually recommend eating lots of good sources of healthy fats such as seeds, nuts, avocados, olives, coconut oil etc… as well as plenty of carbohydrates (such as fruit, veggies, starchy carbs), since","In general, if you're insulin resistant, then no. But there are some conditions that may warrant a low-carb, high fat (LCHF) approach. The most common example is type 2 diabetics who have not been able to use their diabetic medications as well because of the side effects associated with them. Also, many patients with cancer or other disease processes where blood sugar control is a major concern may benefit from this kind of diet. Finally, if you have a condition that causes your liver and/or kidneys to become damaged - such as hepatitis C - you may want to avoid these diets. If you have any questions about whether a particular dietary plan is appropriate for you, consult your physician or a registered dietitian.

Q: What are the benefits / risks of eating a ketogenic / keto diet?\nA: I don't know of any studies in humans showing that a low-carb, high-fat (LCHF) diet offers any health benefits over a normal diet. But there are certainly ways that a low-carb, high-fat (LCHF) diet can help improve cardiovascular risk factors - especially LDL cholesterol. There's also evidence that a ketogenic / keto diet reduces appetite, promotes weight loss, and helps with symptoms associated with mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc. So it seems possible that it could be helpful for certain people to reduce their carb intake so they can lose weight better. Another way that a LCHF approach might work is by lowering levels of inflammatory molecules in the body. It's also possible that a low-carb diet might increase levels of testosterone in men - since testosterone is known to play a role in fertility and sexual function. And of course, there's still the potential for dangerous complications from a high-carb diet. For now though, I think that it's best to focus on keeping weight off and avoiding complications.


Q: What does it mean when someone says that they're following a ketogenic / keto diet?\nA: Most often this means having the fats removed entirely and replacing them with carbs. You can read more about what this actually means on my article How to eat a ketogenic / keto diet. A more detailed description of a ketogenic / keto diet can be found here:

What is a Ketogenic Diet and How Does it Work?"
45,Q: Can diabetes be cured?\nA:,"Yes, but the process is very complicated. First of all you have to remove the cause, then eliminate it, and finally replace it. A better question would be can diabetes be prevented? The answer is yes.\r

\r

The first step in controlling diabetes is removing insulin from circulation. That's why people are often referred to as diabetics or prediabetic because they're already diabetic when their blood glucose levels exceed a certain threshold (usually at about 140 mg/dl). This is called hyperglycemia \u2014 which means too much sugar (glucose) in your bloodstream. If your blood glucose level goes over this threshold, you'll need to get rid of some of that sugar through insulin injections.\r

\r

There are two main types of insulin available on the market today: \u201cHumalog\u201d and \u201cLantus\u201d. Humalogs work by adding small amounts of insulin to the blood stream instead of using it directly. Lantus works similarly but uses the body's own cells to make the hormone. Both drugs take effect slowly enough that you don't feel any effects until your blood glucose level drops below the pre-set target for each drug. These targets vary widely depending on your age, gender and other factors. But if you meet them, your doctor will probably prescribe one of these drugs along with an oral medication that helps increase your supply of the right kind of insulin. Once your glucose is under control, your doctor will start watching your blood glucose level more closely. It's essential to note, however, that once your diabetes is controlled, there is no guarantee that your diabetes won't come back, even after years of healthy eating and regular exercise.\r

\r

One way or another, though, you can prevent diabetes in its tracks. Diabetes, like most chronic diseases, has many causes. But eliminating the underlying problem doesn't always solve the root cause; it just shifts the focus away from trying to fix something that can\u2019t possibly be fixed. For example, reducing physical activity may reduce your risk of developing diabetes, but it certainly isn't going to stop it. In fact, studies show that physical activity improves insulin sensitivity in obese individuals, but not those who aren't overweight. Furthermore, exercise alone does not improve the overall health of a person who suffers from type 2 diabetes. \r

\r

Even so, diet can play","Yes, however it is very expensive and not for everyone. But don't take my word for it, check out the links in this article below.

Q: What are some of the best diabetic diets to get started with?\nA: My personal favorite diet is the one I have been following since 2009: http://diabetes-diet.com/","Yes, if you have a person with the right type of insulin.

Q: Why is it important that people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are monitored for long-term complications?\nA: Long term complications include kidney failure (kidney disease), stroke, heart attacks, blindness and other serious health problems. People who don't monitor their blood sugar closely can also get diabetes later in life or develop a chronic condition such as diabetes.


FDA has approved two types of insulin for diabetics. They provide an alternate route to deliver insulin, but they take several hours longer than normal insulin and may cause side effects.","Yes, in most cases. The best-known example of this is the case of an Ethiopian who was cured by consuming a special type of food called ""pulses"" made from corn. In other cases, people with diabetes can recover completely without any medication or diet changes.

Q: How do you handle blood sugar levels?


A: A good analogy for how we deal with blood sugars would be if you were to walk out on your front porch and your neighbor had an angry dog chasing after you; in that case you'd probably want to run away quickly because your blood sugar level could get too high and you might die from shock. However, when it comes to diabetes, our primary concern isn't whether the glucose will kill us (although this may happen at some point), but rather whether it will damage our bodies enough so that we have to take several different types of medication just to stay alive. So one thing we look for in patients is their blood glucose levels over time. It's not uncommon for patients to lose 10% or more of their body weight within three months of starting treatment, which makes them feel worse than they did before their diagnosis (or even before they became diabetic). This means that we need to monitor their blood sugar carefully during that time, since even small decreases could mean a potential life-threatening spike later.

Q: What are insulin pumps?


A: Insulin pumps are devices that allow you to administer insulin directly into the bloodstream instead of having it shipped through a pump into your stomach. You don't need to remember to take your medicine every day; you just go back to your regular dosages and let the machine deliver the correct amount.

They've also become popular for people with Type 1 Diabetes who prefer to control their blood sugar with injections. If you're considering using an insulin pump, we strongly recommend talking to your doctor about what type of health insurance you qualify for. Most insurers will cover the cost of these machines, but if you fall under an older program or are insured through a Medicaid waiver program, you might pay less, particularly if you already receive monthly insulin payments as part of your medical benefits.

Q: Is insulin injected directly into my muscle tissue (intravenous)?

A: No! There are two main reasons why insulin injections aren't used: First, there's no evidence that they work any better than injections into the vein. Second, many people who","Yes, it can. Diabetes is a disease that affects your blood sugar and metabolism. If you have type 1 or 2 diabetes, the cause of this disease is unknown, but you may have inherited certain genes from both parents who carry the gene for type 1 or 2 diabetes. The genetic makeup of each person's body determines whether they will develop type 1 or 2 diabetes.

Diabetes is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks the cells of your pancreas, causing them to produce too many insulin-producing beta cells (called beta cells). This causes high levels of blood glucose to build up inside the bloodstream. High blood glucose harms the brain and other organs. People with Type 1 diabetes must take insulin injections every day in order to keep their blood glucose under control. Some people need only occasional daily injections because their bodies make enough insulin by themselves; others require frequent injections to prevent damage to vital organ systems. Because diabetes is often not diagnosed until a child reaches adulthood, children are at risk for developing the disease when they are younger than 6 years old. There are currently no treatments to cure diabetes, although lifestyle changes such as exercising more and eating fewer carbohydrates may help control symptoms. A number of drugs may also be prescribed for diabetes patients. These include metformin, glipizide and liraglutide, which work by lowering blood pressure and improving insulin resistance. In addition, medications used to treat epilepsy can reduce or eliminate seizures associated with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded a study to determine if increasing fat consumption could lower blood cholesterol levels and, therefore, lower the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke. Results showed that individuals with a higher intake of saturated fat had smaller increases in LDL cholesterol compared to those consuming less saturated fat. However, the researchers did not find any significant difference in total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels between groups consuming different amounts of dietary fat. This finding suggests that higher dietary saturated fat does not appear to significantly increase the risk for coronary artery disease or its complications. Further research is needed before these findings can be applied in clinical practice to decrease the risk of heart problems.","There are no cures for diabetes. But a cure is possible with proper diet and exercise, and it can come as soon as you begin taking steps to control your blood sugar levels. For more information on how to improve your health and prevent the disease from progressing, see www.diabetes-free.org.

""The bottom line is that insulin is an essential hormone,"" says Dr. Michael Eades, director of the Diabetes Center at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""Your body needs insulin if it's going to produce glucose."" The more you use insulin, however, the less effective it becomes; by using it too much, your cells will eventually become resistant to its effects. This means they'll need even more insulin than before — a vicious cycle that makes diabetic symptoms worse.

To get out of this cycle, you have to either lower your dosage or increase your activity level — both of which take time. And once your body starts losing effectiveness with insulin, it may continue to lose effectiveness over time. ""You have to balance these factors carefully, but the good news is, we're making progress,"" Dr. Eades says. ""We've made significant strides toward developing medications that could help millions of diabetics who want them.""

Diabetes Treatment Options

While most people diagnosed with type 1 diabetes receive insulin injections regularly (usually weekly) through an injection pump, about 30 percent of those with type 2 diabetes must rely on oral medication to manage their condition. However, there is some variation between different types of diabetes treatment options based on your medical history and individual circumstances.

Some patients require only one type of diabetes therapy while others need two or three. Also, not all forms of diabetes treatment are appropriate for everyone. If you don't know whether a particular approach might work best for you, talk to your doctor to find out what you should do next.

For example, type 1 diabetics often prefer to avoid insulin injections, because this method has been shown to cause some side effects such as numbness in the arms and legs. In contrast, some type 2 diabetics also use insulin injections, although this strategy can increase their risk for life-threatening complications such as heart attacks and strokes.

Also, although oral medications tend to be safer than injections, you shouldn't stop taking your insulin without talking to your doctor first. It's common to notice some side effects after stopping insulin, including headache, fatigue, nausea, constipation and dizziness. Many times these issues","No, it can't.\r

\r

Treatment involves preventing the onset of the disease and controlling its progression\r

and many people will need to take medication for life. For people with \r

diabetes that have an established cure from cancer or HIV/AIDS, their\r

disease is usually controlled by lifestyle modification, diet changes,\r

exercise, and medication. The goal in managing diabetes is a healthy \r

body with normal levels of glucose, insulin, and other hormones. It's possible\r

that some patients may develop side effects in response to medications such as\r

insulin; however, these are typically minor and do not require changing treatment.\r

Diabetes can also be managed using technology like insulin pumps.\r

Numerous studies have been done on various forms of therapy, but there isn\r

not yet enough evidence to say which form of therapy is most effective.\r

There's no proof that any drug or device works for everyone, so the best advice is\r

to discuss your treatment options with your doctor. They'll guide you through\r

the process with you and help you determine whether any of them would\r

be appropriate for you.\r

A person with type 1 or type 2 can never completely eliminate the risk of developing diabetes, and this risk is increased among people who have not been diagnosed with the disease.Diabetes can lead to a number of complications such as kidney problems, heart attack and stroke (although these are generally rare), nerve damage and blindness. Some individuals also suffer from osteoporosis, which can cause bones to become fragile and break easily.Diabetes has affected more than 100 million Americans over the past four decades1. It affects both men and women equally. It's estimated that about 20% of all African-American adults have been diagnosed with diabetes2. This number will increase due to the increasing obesity rates in African-Americans3. In addition, diabetes may affect anyone of any age, race or ethnicity; however, it is likely that the rate of diabetes increases in older people4. The prevalence of adult diabetes mellitus (DM) ranges between 11.6 and 15.7%.5In 2011, approximately 21 percent of white American adults had DM1. It was estimated that 18.9 percent of Latinos had DM2. Approximately 10.5 percent of Asians and 3.8 percent of Native Americans were also diagnosed with the condition in 20116.In 2009, diabetes accounted for 8 percent of U.S. deaths7, according to CDC data. Diabetes was responsible for 39,000 deaths each year. This figure is expected to double by 2050 because of rising populations and an aging population8.","Yes. Diabetes can be reversed through a diet that is low in fat, cholesterol and saturated fats and high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes. The most important aspects of the Atkins diet are cutting out sugar and refined carbohydrates, and replacing them with fresh produce. Many patients have reported improvements in their blood glucose levels.

Q: What happened to my blood sugar level after I quit eating gluten?A: If you were following an Atkins-type diet for several months, your blood sugar should have dropped significantly. But it may take weeks or even months for symptoms to disappear completely. It takes time for your body's own healing mechanisms to kick in. Gluten does not cause significant damage to the small intestine, but it can make the digestion of nutrients more difficult. Your doctor will evaluate your situation carefully before prescribing any kind of medication. He or she might recommend other approaches as well.

Q: My body isn't used to losing weight, so I don't feel great after I lose 5 pounds!A: Most people respond very positively to weight loss, and many experience increased energy and better moods. However, everyone responds differently to this type of treatment. Weight loss surgery (which includes gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy and/or liposuction) involves substantial surgical procedures, including incisions under the chin, stomach and intestines, as well as extensive scarring. Because of these risks, it is often difficult to achieve long-term weight loss. Although some research suggests that obesity itself may be linked to heart disease, there is no clear evidence linking long-term obesity to serious medical problems such as stroke or cancer. For a successful outcome, your surgeon would advise against trying to slim down by eliminating certain foods or calories from your diet.

Q: Is it safe to eat gluten-free if I'm allergic to wheat?A: Eating gluten without being severely intolerant to it probably won't harm you. In fact, you may find that wheat and other grain products taste better than when they're made with gluten. A few studies suggest that people who avoid all types of food containing gluten aren't at greater risk of developing allergies later on. While it's true that celiac disease – which causes chronic inflammation and damage to the small intestine – is an autoimmune disorder, it doesn't require celiac antibodies. So if you're currently healthy enough to tolerate gluten, avoiding it shouldn't pose any problem.","No. \nB: Why not?\r

Dr. Mervin Smith, a former professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, is an expert on metabolic syndrome, the condition that leads to Type 2 diabetes. He has been in the field for more than 30 years, and says we are living in the Golden Age of obesity.

""In our lifetimes, almost every single person will be obese. We've got this huge population with huge health problems because of obesity. The numbers of people dying from heart disease have dropped by 50 percent since 1980,"" he said. ""But if you look at deaths from diseases associated with excess weight, those numbers have skyrocketed.""

For example, there were about 1 million deaths each year from cancer related to obesity in 2010. And one-third of adults now have some form of chronic or acute kidney disease, which Dr. Smith said is just as deadly as Type 2 diabetes.

He also noted that the rise in childhood obesity rates is far greater than what is being observed in adults.

""There's not much change in children -- they're getting fatter in adolescence. But their adult size hasn't changed very much,"" he said.

51,Q: What is holistic medicine and what does it include?\nA:,"The term ""holistic"" means that each component of the system will work together to treat a particular problem, rather than being isolated from one another. For example, one might use a holistic approach in treating an asthma attack or rheumatoid arthritis. In this way, multiple components of the system are working together to address the underlying cause of symptoms. Holistic treatments focus on prevention, rather than diagnosis.

Q: Is there an emphasis placed on exercise/exercise prescriptions as part of holistic treatment?

A: There is no evidence that exercise alone can cure any illness; in fact, there is little evidence that any specific exercise regimen is effective at all. However, certain types of exercise have been shown to decrease the risk for conditions such as heart disease and stroke. For patients with chronic illnesses (such as diabetes), exercise may be recommended along with diet and lifestyle changes. For people who do not exercise regularly (such as those in sedentary jobs), a structured program of moderate physical activity may help them improve their quality of life by reducing the risk for many chronic diseases.

Q: How often should I see my doctor about my health concerns?

A: Your physician may ask you questions regarding your general health, family history, medications and other factors before making recommendations on how often to visit your doctor. It also depends on which type of health care provider you choose. Some providers offer free checkups at the beginning of the year, others send out patients' bills every month. If you plan to live independently and need regular checkups, discuss these options with your primary care provider so they know whether to refer you to a specialist or allow you to go without care for some time.

Q: Do I qualify for subsidized insurance if I don't receive coverage through my job?

A: Many employers offer their employees subsidized insurance plans. If you're eligible for federal government assistance programs like Medicaid and Medicare but your employer doesn't provide affordable insurance, you'll probably need to find private insurance through an exchange (a marketplace where consumers purchase policies online). Depending on where you live and your income level, it's possible that you could qualify for subsidies based on your household size and income. You can read more information about insurance eligibility here.","The term ""holistic"" refers to the use of natural remedies, dietary restrictions, and other means to achieve a complete health status. \nB: There are also specific terms for those treatments that have not been studied scientifically. Examples of these therapies might be homeopathy and acupuncture.\r


Q: What is integrative medicine and how can it help patients with chronic disease?\nA: Integrative medicine consists of various approaches in addition to conventional care that work together to promote wellness and long-term recovery from complex medical problems. The most common treatments used within integrative medicine are diet (including supplements), lifestyle changes (such as increased activity levels or stress management), and medication (often prescription drugs). One approach to achieving optimal health through integrative medicine involves combining multiple modalities into an integrated treatment program. Some common modalities included in this approach include biofeedback, massage therapy, nutritional counseling and nutrition. While not all integrative practitioners specialize in one modality or group of modalities, many practitioners offer a wide range of modalities at a reasonable price. A good example of an integrative practice would be a naturopathic physician who focuses on digestive health and detoxification.\r


Q: What types of diseases and conditions affect individuals differently?\nA: Different diseases and conditions will impact people differently based upon their genes, genetic makeup, age, gender, weight, physical activity level, ethnicity, environmental exposures, social interaction and lifestyle choices. For instance, some diseases may only affect certain populations more than others, including people with poor socioeconomic backgrounds, younger adults, women, or members of certain racial groups. Other diseases and conditions may affect different groups equally, such as diabetes mellitus affecting both men and women, stroke affecting everyone, asthma affecting both children and adults, and arthritis affecting both children and adults. These differences may contribute to the severity of disease symptoms among different groups. For example, someone with heart failure may require less medication and medical intervention than someone who has diabetes or hypertension.\r


Q: How do I find out about integrative health options if I don't live in a large city, metropolitan area, or in a rural area?\r

In addition to a complete list of practitioners who have received training with the National Council on Complementary and Alternative Health, this directory also contains information about each practitioner's background and professional experiences.","There are various definitions of the term ""holistic"" depending on who you ask, but there really isn't a universal definition. It basically means that when we think about health care, we need to make sure that all of our interventions or treatments for illness have at least some of their roots in science. This means focusing on things like nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress management, environmental conditions (like air pollution), medication use, etc., rather than treating illnesses based on outdated ""natural"" remedies. For example, many people have heard of homeopathy as an alternative treatment option, but few realize how outdated this concept actually is. Homeopathic remedies work by manipulating substances like minerals or organic compounds such as essential oils or plant extracts without actually testing them in a laboratory or making any chemicals themselves. They rely instead on traditional knowledge derived from the natural world, which can be very hard to come by. In other words, homeopaths do not synthesize the compounds they use in their remedy; they simply take these components naturally occurring in nature—and sometimes even mix them up with something else—to create an oil that has properties similar to those found in nature. Because of the lack of standardization and regulation around homeopathic medicines, one must be extremely careful when choosing whether or not to treat a particular ailment with a homeopathic remedy. In addition, no scientific research has ever confirmed or debunked any specific claim made by homeopaths, so it's difficult to know if a remedy actually works. \NIn addition, because there are no guarantees that using homeopathy will work for every illness, it also doesn't mean that the alternative medicine itself should be ignored. Some may find that taking part in a complementary therapy program allows them to reduce their anxiety symptoms while still being fully supported by the healthcare system. Other patients may benefit from regular visits to a medical doctor who provides the support they need to live healthy lives. The bottom line is that holistic medicine takes into account all factors involved in improving health. As an example, if a patient comes in complaining of chronic pain, he needs to focus on ways his diet, activity level, physical fitness, lifestyle choices, stress levels, social connections, depression and other mental issues contribute to his overall health status. If the first three indicators point to increased inflammation due to unhealthy eating habits, exercise habits, and other lifestyle factors, then more research will need to be done to determine the true cause of the pain, along with a possible solution. This type of approach eliminates unnecessary tests and unnecessary drugs, which can ultimately save","The term ""holistic"" is used to describe the approach of treating a patient's whole body in harmony with one's internal health. A healthy body, mind, spirit and environment are interconnected. Holistically-minded doctors use medical science and clinical reasoning to determine which treatment options will best treat each patient's needs. They follow an integrative model based on physical, psychological, social and spiritual factors that all contribute to disease prevention and management. Examples of holism-based interventions include yoga, meditation, acupuncture, chiropractic care, nutrition counseling, herbs, nutritional supplements and homeopathy, among many other types of therapies. \N: When will holistic medicine become more accepted?\r


The concept of holistic medicine has gained momentum over the past 20 years as evidence has accumulated demonstrating its effectiveness for treating some of our nation's most complex and challenging chronic diseases. At the same time, though, this idea remains somewhat controversial because of misconceptions about what constitutes ""holistic"" medicine and skepticism toward conventional treatments. However, recent advances in research have provided an increasingly robust basis for belief that a holistic approach can improve quality of life by increasing general health and wellbeing. While the acceptance rate of holistic approaches is still low at approximately 5 percent (in part due to concerns regarding potential side effects), there is now mounting scientific evidence demonstrating the efficacy of these treatments against common disorders such as asthma, heart failure, cancer, arthritis, diabetes and depression. In addition, researchers continue to learn from these studies about how they work, including their mechanisms of action. Finally, there are numerous non-pharmaceutical complementary approaches available for patients who wish to incorporate aspects of holistic therapy into their overall treatment plan. For example, holistic practitioners often recommend dietary changes, herbal remedies, exercise programs, and massage techniques. Many holistic professionals also refer patients for alternative diagnoses including neurology and psychiatry when conventional care fails to provide relief for specific symptoms. Finally, clinicians should be prepared to recognize that not everyone seeking help through a traditional system will go through conventional treatment first, particularly if they believe that unconventional modalities may offer better results. As an added benefit, conventional providers must consider how to integrate new therapies or alternatives into their practices without compromising quality of care. This can mean finding ways to communicate effectively with clients while maintaining ethical standards. The American College of Physicians offers guidance for integrating complementary therapies and integrative models.\r

Q: When can one start practicing this type of medicine?\nA: By age 4.


1- A child's natural immune system will be stronger than an adult's. The young child cannot develop allergies to food or medication like adults do because their bodies have not had the chance to develop antibodies against these substances yet. Therefore, any illness that occurs in children is usually caused by a reaction in the body to foreign substances such as bacteria, viruses or fungi instead of a disease being caused by an actual virus. This also applies to illnesses which are more likely to occur in babies and toddlers (such as ear infections, eczema and sinusitis).


2- In case you're concerned about a vaccine injury, consider that the average age at which a baby becomes immunized for measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, chicken pox and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) has increased from 6 months to 14 years old since 1988.


3- Children who get too much vitamin A during early childhood may become hyperactive, have poor concentration, irritability, trouble sleeping, lose weight and even grow large heads. Vitamin D deficiency in infants can lead to a condition called rickets. Adults must take supplements to maintain adequate levels of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and other essential minerals and vitamins. People with low stomach acid or a weak immune system should avoid certain foods such as egg yolk, fish and shellfish, milk products and dairy products. If they are sick with fever, coughs, shortness of breath, sore throat and muscle aches, they should eat plenty of fluids, salt and fruit juices. If there is no obvious cause of their symptoms, the first thing to do is contact your doctor or local health department, especially if symptoms begin within 1 hour of eating or drinking something bad.

Source(s): I've been following my daughter on her journey through life for over 5 years now. She was born 3 weeks premature and came home after 8 hours of surgery from NICU in a blood transfusion and she needed an emergency caesarean section after 5 days and then she started on some meds before school. My son got his tonsils out but he had pneumonia while he was in middle school","""Holistic medicine"" refers to a medical approach based on an integrative approach that embraces the entire person, including those areas of health where traditional Western medicine has failed. A holistic approach incorporates a variety of modalities into a comprehensive treatment plan. The goal of this system is to balance the body's functions so that individuals have greater resilience against disease and chronic illness. Holistic medicine also encompasses a multidisciplinary team approach for patients who are not able to provide their own care. In addition to using standard treatments, such as conventional drugs or surgery, holistic physicians may prescribe complementary therapies, dietary supplements, lifestyle changes, or other interventions designed to restore homeostasis in each area of the body. \NQ: Why should I consider joining the NCNA/ACBP?\nA: In addition to improving your health and wellness, you will enjoy benefits beyond monetary reimbursement. Our organization provides educational opportunities to members and nonmembers alike, which allow them to meet one another face-to-face and build community within the profession. Furthermore, we support our membership with professional development opportunities through state-of-the-art training programs that prepare professionals to work effectively with patients who suffer from physical and mental illnesses. Additionally, as the national association representing more than 40,000 licensed acupuncturists and naturopathic doctors, we strive to advance all facets of medical practice by providing education to the public about alternative approaches to healing, educating policymakers about the importance of a diverse workforce in healthcare delivery systems, and supporting the advancement of scientific knowledge of complementary and alternative approaches. As a member-based organization, we encourage active participation in both advocacy efforts and legislative lobbying to protect the rights of practitioners who use complementary approaches for patient care.

We're also looking for specific areas where there may be an imbalance within the body as well as other causes such as stress. And then we try to support those things using natural methods and therapies that are proven to work. For example, I have been practicing holistic massage, which involves massaging the entire body rather than focusing on specific parts such as the head or shoulders, etc. This helps to get the full effect from all the different techniques used, including acupuncture. Another area where we think that traditional Chinese medicine can really help us is with digestive issues like irritable bowel syndrome. But also, we can use herbal remedies such as ginseng and ginger to reduce anxiety and depression. We feel that since traditional Chinese medicine has always focused on preventing illness, it's a good place to start because you don't want to make any lifestyle changes until your body is healthy enough to do so. \nB: Why should people who choose this type of practice give their money to you and your organization, The Golden Lily Foundation?\r

\nA: Our aim is to raise awareness about the value of health care, but we also want everyone to have access to high-quality health care. It's very important to me that women understand the importance of taking control over their own reproductive organs, and that they know how to take care of themselves when they become pregnant, even if it means going without routine checkups or contraception for many months during pregnancy. That's why my foundation focuses on educating women about the benefits of fertility awareness methods, including the use of acupuncture and herbs, as well as counseling them on how to find their ideal birth plan. In addition, we teach couples how to communicate effectively about their choices by using the tools they already possess -- namely communication skills. By communicating honestly and openly with each other, these couples can realize their best chance at success is to be together through natural family planning. By being open, honest and honest about our experiences and preferences, we ensure that both partners will enjoy healthier and happier pregnancies. With our resources in mind, we've helped thousands of women avoid infertility and to achieve their dream of having children. Now that our efforts to educate women are beginning to pay off, I'm happy to say that nearly 10% of our revenue comes from donations. The rest comes from sponsorships and sales (mainly online"
52,Q: What are the most common mental health problems? How can I prevent or manage the most common mental health problems?\nA:,"The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that between 12.8 and 15 percent of all American adults will experience some kind of major depression in any given year, with about 2.5 million Americans experiencing major depressive disorder each year (NIMH, 2004a). Major depression is a condition characterized by depressed mood lasting at least two weeks and associated with significant impairment in social, occupational or other areas of functioning. It often involves at least three symptoms:

1. A loss of interest or pleasure usually accompanied by weight loss

2. Lethargy or sleep disturbance

3. Feelings of guilt or worthlessness

4. Changes in appetite or weight

The NIMH also reports that suicide is the third leading cause of death for Americans aged 10 to 44 years old. Suicide is one of four main causes of death among men and women. Other major causes of death include accidents, homicides, and diseases including cancer and chronic respiratory disease (National Center for Injury Prevention and Control [NCIPC], 2006). Individuals who develop serious mental illness have an increased risk for suicidal behaviors (Paller et al., 2001; Sommers, 2005). An estimated 50 percent of people with severe depression attempt suicide during their lifetime (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 2003), and more than 20 percent will die from it within five years (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2010; CDC 2007) as compared to 16 percent of people without depression who commit suicide. These rates are similar to those seen in previous studies examining suicide attempts (Erez-Likhovskii et al., 2002). Most individuals diagnosed with depression receive treatment. Treatment consists of psychotherapy, medications, or both. Medications commonly prescribed for depression are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine, escitalopram, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, bupropion, and vilazodone. Other medication choices include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and lithium. SSRIs, which are used as monotherapy in about 75% of cases, do not cure depression but may help control its symptoms. Some patients respond well to antidepressant drugs alone, while others require several different treatments before they are fully treated. MAOIs and TCAs, typically used in combination, are considered ""medication-resistant"" because they tend to produce side","Mental illness affects millions of people worldwide. It is estimated that the prevalence rate for depression in the United States is 17%, and it is likely to be even higher among women (1). As a result, there may not be a single disorder that is more common than another across all populations. While many individuals with depression experience significant distress over their condition, others have no problem functioning. The number one risk factor for developing major depressive disorder is having a family history of this disease (2). It has been reported that up to 50% of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder had an older brother or sister who also experienced symptoms of depression (3). Most people with serious mental disorders do not seek treatment because they do not know where to go or how to get help. Many believe that a diagnosis means you must accept your condition as normal, but this simply is not true. There is an urgent need for better screening tools to identify people at high risk for suicide before the onset of a depressive episode. In addition, interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy or medication management may reduce suicidal thoughts in some cases. It is important to realize that being treated for a mental health condition does not guarantee recovery from depression. For example, people with schizophrenia who receive proper medical care often recover completely. However, those with untreated psychosis will remain vulnerable to future episodes of the same disorder.

Mental illness, including anxiety and depression, may be related to biological factors such as genetics, hormone levels (e.g., estrogen), neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine) or environmental factors (e.g., stress). Other conditions that are associated with severe psychological distress include substance abuse, eating disorder symptoms, sleep disturbances and mood swings. Some people who have experienced mental illness do not go on to develop other chronic medical conditions. However, some chronic physical conditions may also occur in individuals who have been diagnosed with a mental health disorder. For example, certain psychiatric disorders often co-occur with heart disease, diabetes and cancer. It is important for physicians and patients to understand that any one of these conditions can trigger an individual's development of another mental condition. As part of your care at the hospital, you will receive regular and ongoing treatment counseling regarding your mental health concerns. In addition, the following treatments and therapies may help reduce the frequency of your depression or anxiety, decrease the severity of your depression or anxiety and improve your quality of life. These treatments and therapies may help reduce the risk of developing additional chronic illnesses such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke and certain cancers: Medications for acute episodes

Psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness meditation and yoga for chronic episodes

Social support groups for family members or friends experiencing similar depressive or anxiety symptoms

Family education programs about depression or other types of mental health challenges The American Psychiatric Association (APA) has published a document entitled ""The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – 5th Edition,"" which lists all the DSM diagnoses. This document includes a brief summary of each diagnosis, along with information on how it is treated. See Appendix C below for more information about the APA's diagnostic criteria. You can read the full text of this document on their website, www.dsm5.org. While reading this document, we encourage you to consult your doctor or mental health professional if you have questions about specific symptoms or if you need medication changes based on the new edition of the DSM. You may also want to consider speaking to your GP, a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist about your own personal experience using medications and/or psychotherapy, particularly if you feel under increasing pressure due to your mental health condition. If your symptoms change dramatically but remain present, ask your healthcare provider what medications you should try next. Also, ask about possible future changes in your treatment regimen, particularly if there have been no changes to your symptoms","Mental health is a complex problem that affects us all, regardless of age and sex. Mental illnesses include depression, bipolar disorder (manic-depression), anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. The majority of people with these conditions are young adults aged between 20 and 40 years old, but it can affect anyone who experiences stressful life events such as divorce, bereavement and loss of employment, for example. As well as these common issues we see, there are many other less obvious causes including eating disorders, substance abuse and self harm. \nBriefly summarising this section, if you have symptoms which do not match the criteria in this guide then the first step is to seek help from your doctor. This will require them to check whether the condition you're experiencing fits into one of the categories listed above; and if so, what the cause is. If you still think the condition doesn't fit then you may need to work through a series of questions to find out exactly why you feel distressed. You should be aware that at any stage in this process, your GP or psychologist could refer you to other medical professionals, such as a psychiatrist, occupational therapist, counsellor or psychologist, depending on the nature of your symptoms, their severity and how they impact on your day-to-day activities. If you choose to get professional advice about getting better from someone else, make sure they know about your condition so that they don't inadvertently treat you differently from everyone else, and that you've discussed the possibility of leaving the relationship before you enter treatment. A list of organisations where you can get support for mental health problems and a referral form are available via NHS Choices. It's also possible to get help online, either by calling helplines run by charities or government departments. Find further information below for some of the more common mental health problems. There's no substitute for talking to someone about your needs.

1) Depression \u00a0Symptoms of depression can vary widely, but for most people, feeling down or depressed is associated with low mood or loss of interest in usual things. However, even if you experience milder forms of depression - like those described above - you may still benefit from talking with your doctor about ways of managing it. Your doctor can help you learn new coping strategies and identify triggers. They'll likely recommend taking antidepressant medication, although different medicines may be prescribed depending on the type of depression you have. Read more here.

2) Bipolar Disorder \u00a0The term 'bipolar' means","Mental disorders can have a variety of causes, from genetic factors to environmental influences. Some people with mental disorders show no outward signs that they're sick; they might not seem sad, anxious or depressed at all. Others might feel different when compared to other people in their social and work environments, leading them to question whether they really belong there. While it's important for you to talk with your doctor about any changes in your physical health or behavior, it's especially helpful if you understand how your mental health has been affected by these issues and what can be done to address them to keep you healthy. \nA: The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) supports the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Healthy People 2020 initiative through its efforts to make sure all Americans live long, active lives.

For instance, some people experience chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), which may be caused by an immune system disorder; depression is one symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); and anxiety is another symptom of PTSD. These disorders can affect you in different ways. Some people with these illnesses also have problems with substance use and abuse, such as alcoholism and drug and alcohol dependence. Others do not have any psychiatric symptoms but report significant changes in their physical appearance, behavior, or sleep patterns. A number of other conditions may be associated with these problems, too. The following list summarizes common problems and their treatment options. \NACIH NIMH Publication #2011-13.\r

People with these conditions often have a variety of problems with their interpersonal relationships, work, school and family life. While people who suffer from these kinds of psychological disorders may not be able to control their symptoms, they do need treatment in order to improve their quality of life.\ n \n

As an example, some people may feel depressed because they don't feel like going out anymore, so they go to bed early rather than stay up late watching television and getting into arguments with their spouses or partners. Other individuals might develop a negative self-image due to concerns about physical appearance and weight. People can also experience a depressive episode when they feel overwhelmed by feelings of helplessness over being unable to solve their own problems.\ nIn addition, people suffering from personality disorders (such as antisocial personality disorder, paranoid personality disorder, and borderline personality disorder) may tend to display impulsive and irrational behaviors that may make it difficult for them to cope with stressors such as job loss, divorce, or illness. When coping with these issues, people with these kinds of disorders typically seek help through their doctors and therapists.\ n

Another major challenge is understanding how specific behavioral problems influence one's chances of developing a mental health disorder. For instance, research indicates that if someone has experienced childhood trauma or severe emotional abuse, they are more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The link between chronic stress and mental health problems is further strengthened by recent evidence showing that certain genetic factors influence vulnerability to PTSD and other types of mental illnesses. Research shows that certain variations in genes determine whether someone is genetically susceptible to experiencing chronic stressful events. Because certain genes affect risk for PTSD and other mental illnesses, prevention strategies may be useful during adolescence and young adulthood.\ nThe National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the American Psychological Association recommend that teens who want to reduce or eliminate their drinking should avoid binge drinking and limit alcohol intake to no more than two drinks per day for women, and three drinks per day for men.\ nDrinking too much alcohol in small amounts while under the influence of other drugs such as marijuana increases risks for negative effects on brain function, including decreased memory and concentration.\ nFor more information, visit www.americanpublichealthsystem.org/mentalhealth/pubs/.","Mental illnesses often come in waves that last from a few weeks to years.

This is a brief summary of major types of mental disorders and their symptoms. It is important to remember that different people will experience depression, anxiety or psychosis at different times over the course of their lives.

It's important to know how to deal with feelings like sadness, anger or frustration (also called emotional pain) when they occur. This article explains what emotions mean and why we feel them so strongly. Read more about 'Emotional Pain'. Click here.","Mental Health is a complex area of medicine with numerous sub-disorders, many of which need specialized treatment. The most commonly recognized disorders and their associated disorders include depression, anxiety disorder (ADHD), ADHD, bipolar disorder (manic depressive illness) and schizophrenia. Some individuals also have substance use disorders as well as other psychiatric diagnoses such as schizophrenia spectrum (schizoaffective disorder). One symptom of anxiety or depression is loss of interest in activities, hobbies, or social interactions, including those that may seem pleasant or pleasurable. People may worry excessively about what they see or hear, become easily frustrated or anxious, become apathetic to people and surroundings, avoid eye contact and conversation, and experience intrusive thoughts (for example, ""I don't like you""). Other symptoms of anxiety include being restless or having difficulty sleeping or relaxing, feeling overwhelmed by feelings of guilt, shame or worthlessness, feeling irritable or out of control, losing interest in going out into the world or doing things with friends, feeling hopeless and/or giving up. Many people suffer from an emotional eating disorder when they eat at inappropriate times or without eating certain foods because of fear of gaining weight. Others complain of sleep deprivation or oversleeping. Sometimes these symptoms are mild and go unnoticed but sometimes they lead to increased rates of self-harm, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and even violence. People with some types of physical illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, etc., can develop stress and/or anger issues. For people living with a mental illness, some types of medications can help reduce symptoms and improve mood. If you think you may be experiencing symptoms related to your mental health you should seek professional guidance immediately.

The following list includes some of the most common mental disorders that are associated with suicide: anxiety; depression; bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness); schizophrenia; postpartum psychosis; PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder), phobias; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); conduct disorders; alcohol and drug abuse; eating disorders; sexual dysfunction; self harm; and suicide attempts.[1] Some other common mental disorders include major depressive disorder (MDD) and dysthymia, which are characterized by alternating periods of depressed mood and severe distress. There are also an assortment of developmental disabilities associated with ADHD as well as learning difficulties in autism spectrum disorder. It's important to note that while many people suffering from these disorders may not be suicidal, their conditions may increase one's risk for suicide in certain situations. These factors include: being in a relationship with someone who has a diagnosed mental disorder; having suicidal thoughts before you have ever had them; living alone; feeling isolated; being sexually abused as a child; experiencing extreme financial difficulties; and having a history of childhood trauma such as neglect and physical abuse. Suicide prevention organizations such as Samaritans provide support services and resources to help those affected by mental illnesses feel more comfortable discussing their concerns with others, and to provide a safe environment where they can seek help. They also work to create more supportive environments within the communities they serve. For information about suicide prevention and how to get involved, visit www.samaritans.org.

Q: When and why was suicide considered an epidemic?\nA: Historically, suicide was a taboo subject in our society. In fact, until recently no one talked openly about it except in cases of homicide. However, now there are more than 2 million suicides each year worldwide, and this number continues to grow. According to WHO statistics, approximately 65% of all deaths caused by violence occur among people aged between 15 and 44 years old. In 2007, according to UN data, 20.8 million people died due to HIV infection. In addition, there were approximately 1 billion individuals around the world living with dementia at the end of 2010. Furthermore, there are over 100 million chronic diseases and disability in the developing world. With so much going on, it might seem difficult to fathom just how devastating suicide is and yet, people still choose to take their own lives. This statistic shows us we must do"
53,Q: what is psychotherapy?\nA:,"psychological therapy is the clinical treatment of mental disorders. It includes, but is not limited to, the use of medication and other therapies as well as structured psychotherapeutic interventions.

Treatment for Anxiety, Panic Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders, Mood Disorder (Major Depressive Disorder), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with Borderline Personality Disorder and Substance Use Disorders including Alcoholism, Cannabis Dependence, Cocaine Addiction, Nicotine Dependence, Pain Medication Misuse, Other Drug Abuse or Dependency (with or without a prescription).","In my opinion, it's a type of therapy that you can use to help someone with their depression. A person might have been depressed for the last six months or so and has no hope in finding relief. After some time of trying various things (depression pills), taking medication (anti-depressants) and not being able to find relief, they decide that maybe there's something wrong with them. They go through a few sessions of psychotherapy. The purpose of this type of therapy is to try to get to know themselves better. Some people just want to talk about their feelings and don't really care much how they're going to do it. Other people are more interested in learning about themselves as individuals. You should feel free to ask questions. Most people will give you honest answers without giving up too many details that may make them uncomfortable. However, if your therapist gives you advice that you feel is inappropriate, then be aware that he or she might be guilty of abuse. I would think that anyone who tells you how to live your life is potentially abusive, but even when the counselor does not say anything outright, one has to keep an eye out for any clues. I have heard many stories from people who were abused by therapists who gave them bad advice. If a counselor tries to convince you that you need to change your attitude and actions, I would think that he/she is abusing his/her position and has violated ethical standards. \nB: Why did you choose this field?\mA: I have always enjoyed psychology. It brings me joy to see people smile at their children or hear a child laugh. Also, psychology provides a very unique experience. I am always looking for new experiences to expand on, learn new skills and increase my knowledge base. People tend to look down upon those who study other fields because they seem to be stuck doing the same old thing. Psychology is different. There is nothing stagnant about psychology. I enjoy seeing the growth in our students, particularly undergrads. This makes me happy; it means that we are continuing to grow. It also forces us to continually push ourselves. We can't rest on our laurels. There isn't much room for mistakes, especially in graduate school. Our students are like little monkeys that are constantly having to learn new things. This aspect of the program appeals to me greatly. It allows me to provide opportunities for growth and development while making sure that all graduates are ready for employment. I'm also passionate about working with young adults, which helps me maintain a","A therapist is a person who helps people to change their life by working with the way they think, feel and behave. You can use it to make yourself happier or more successful in life. In most countries where there are therapists you will be able to find one through a search engine.

Q: What does an introvert do when he/she goes into therapy?\nA: An introverted person usually takes part in group sessions because they need support from other people while he/she changes his/her thinking and behavior. Introverts work better alone because they don't have the social skills required for this kind of therapy.


Q: How does the mind work?\nA: The mind works like any other machine - it has its own parts that keep it going and its self-adjusting function. It's like your computer, its core functions keep it running. This means that we humans often tend to use certain parts of our minds to adjust things around us, but not all the time. We also use parts of the brain for various types of thought, feeling and behaviour; the idea being that we only use the parts of our brains that allow us to think, feel and act clearly. When someone starts using the whole system they are called an extrovert. However, we still need some parts of the brain to perform basic tasks like controlling breathing or swallowing, which introverts don't need since the rest of the body controls these activities.


Q: What are the major problems associated with introversion?\nA: Most of the people who go into therapy (or similar programs) to deal with mental problems suffer from two main problems. First, they see themselves as having no control over their lives (which is why they seek help). Second, they have a hard time trusting others. Introverts don't need to trust people too much as they can handle their own affairs very well without them knowing about them, so the problem doesn't arise until people try to help.


Q: How can I tell if my friend is an introvert?\nA: A good way would be to ask him / her whether he/she likes to talk on the phone a lot or prefer talking to his/her friends over socializing at home. If they say ""yes"" to both of those questions, then they are probably highly sensitive.

Introverts can enjoy social events and parties, but it's different than how most people tend to experience such situations. They are generally good at","Psychotherapy, or counseling, is the art of helping people gain a better understanding of their own thoughts and feelings by applying techniques that help to change those beliefs and behaviors. It is used in many different settings such as schools, hospitals, homes, offices, churches etc.\r

Q: What are some types of psychotherapists you can call on?\nA: There are many different kinds of psychotherapists who work with all kinds of individuals including children, adolescents, adults, families, couples and groups. Some of these psychotherapists have specific training and knowledge that enables them to provide individualized treatment but others use just general skills to treat many clients. Most of these therapists use techniques that include talking therapies (talk therapy), self-help approaches (cognitive behavioral methods) and medication management strategies (antidepressants).\r

Q: Is it true that when someone chooses to stop seeing a therapist he will never go back and start seeing another one again?\nA: No. The process of choosing not to see a therapist is an important part of psychotherapy. Not wanting to continue seeing a particular therapist does not mean that there is no more value for you in working with that particular counselor at that time or that we cannot help you. Our staff members want to ensure that you get the most out of your experience because they know that your happiness depends upon our success. As we move from session to session you will learn more about how you feel. However, it is very common during this transition period that we notice changes in you and in our relationship with you. We do everything we can to keep you involved throughout this process. That being said, once you make the decision not to see us for whatever reason (whether it be lack of interest, dissatisfaction with our results, a family emergency, financial constraints, any other factors) then our door remains open to you for reattempts.\r

Q: How often should I meet with my therapist?\nA: Once every three months is considered typical and we encourage you to maintain this schedule each month until you find your best fit within the therapeutic relationship. While we don't recommend meeting weekly, it is still good practice to keep the appointment schedule going so you are always aware of what you need to address. You also may wish to keep in touch with friends and family members who might share similar values and goals in order to give you support and encouragement.\r

Q: Can you tell me what a Cognitive Behavioral","It is an approach to the problems of life that involves a dialogue between you and your therapist about your life experiences and how they relate to certain emotions or reactions in others. A psychologist who specializes in psychotherapy works with individuals, couples, families, groups, organizations, and/or schools to help them develop more effective ways to deal with problems, find solutions, create new positive relationships, and regain control over their lives. The goal of treatment is to increase the individual's capacity for change through the process of therapy. \N: What are some of the changes I should expect after becoming a part of your program?\nA: You will begin to realize and express your own feelings; see things from another person's point of view; learn to identify how certain feelings affect you; be able to accept yourself as you really are without judgment; see and experience both your strengths and weaknesses; develop new skills and techniques; become more comfortable with who you are as well as the people around you. \N: What are some other benefits I can receive by participating in this program?\nA: By learning to work with your emotional and behavioral responses to life situations, you will feel better prepared to cope with challenges on your own as well as with the difficulties of others. In addition, by working with professionals who have developed professional competence in handling the specific issues related to your problem behavior, you will be able to gain additional knowledge and understanding that will enhance your ability to manage your life successfully. As you participate in this program, you may also begin to notice that you are making progress toward reducing the levels of stress and tension in your life. This will reduce your risk of developing chronic conditions such as depression, anxiety disorder, substance abuse, etc., which can have serious negative health consequences.

The goal of psychotherapy is to increase the individual's capacity for change through the process of therapy. After beginning our program, we will guide you through each step of the therapeutic process: 1) Finding a therapist 2) Meeting with the therapist 3) Learning the techniques used by the therapists 4) Working together 5) Using these techniques 6) Evaluating the effectiveness of the therapy 7) Reevaluation of the progress 8) Continuing treatment 9) Ending therapy. During each session, you will be asked questions that will allow us to assess the effectiveness of our treatment. We will not give answers during therapy; instead, we want you to actively explore the information given to you in order to come up with your own conclusions and ideas concerning the best way to handle the","a form of psychological therapy that seeks to change attitudes and behaviors by examining the role of unconscious emotions in shaping behavior. Psychotherapeutic techniques often use cognitive behavioral strategies, which are used to teach patients how they think about their problems. A therapist works with a patient's own ideas (or beliefs) rather than trying to convince them they have incorrect ideas or feelings.\r

At San Francisco State University, students interested in pursuing advanced degrees in the sciences often find it challenging to get started without some kind of financial aid. We work closely with several financial aid offices to ensure that incoming CSU students receive the necessary support. Graduate programs, especially those outside of engineering, frequently require special funding","it's a technique of solving problems through the patient/client relationship. it uses questions to guide therapy and helps the client work on their own issues. this approach can be used for any problem that has not been solved in some other way or is difficult to solve. there are many forms of psychotherapy, including Cognitive Therapy (talk therapy), Behavior Therapy (talking with others about one's behavior), Hypnosis, Reiki, EFT, Reflexology, Chiropractic, etc...and more! \r


a: psychotherapy works by helping someone who feels they don't have control over certain feelings or experiences explore their thoughts and feelings that cause these feelings and/or experiences, as well as how these emotions affect everyday life, family relationships, and work \r


b: psychotherapeutic skills include: listening, asking open-ended questions and giving feedback, observing behaviors in response to emotional situations, taking into consideration the different perspectives of people around you (including your therapist), making changes in specific areas of your life, and using self-help techniques like journaling, exercise, yoga, breathing exercises, or relaxation. \r


c: psychotherapy can help with depression, anxiety, OCD, phobias, personality disorders, eating disorders, drug abuse, and much more. \r


d: while each person is different, most people benefit from psychotherapy at some point during their lives. \r


e: sometimes psychotherapy doesn't actually happen. in which case, the individual may consult with another health care professional before considering psychotherapy further. \r


f: psychological counseling is usually done in groups. typically an experienced counselor will visit a group once per month or so. often this is followed up by a brief phone consultation where a counsellor gives information on their practice and how they can refer the individual to them if needed. \r


g: psychological treatment is also referred to as talk therapy or cognitive-behavioral therapy. therapy is not limited to only talking about the issue itself. therapy should provide help in finding solutions to issues\r


h: when therapy is successful, the individual sees results immediately; they feel less depressed, anxious, insecure, or guilty, and they achieve positive outcomes within themselves. In addition, they improve their social and work functioning. \r


i: mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, substance abuse, eating disorders, childhood trauma, and sexual orientation problems can take a long time to resolve.","it is a method of helping patients change their behaviour, attitudes and beliefs in order to help them live better lives. A therapist is someone who can work with an individual on the basis of a theoretical model that they have developed about how to change their life for the better. The psychotherapist helps you see your problems as being caused by your environment (such as past experiences), and not because of anything you do or say. You should discuss these issues with your family doctor when you are referred by your GP.

Q: how does my patient's psychotherapist know I am qualified to give treatment to him/her?\nA: It is important to note that there are different types of therapists and each one will be able to treat you differently. Psychotherapists may also use different techniques, so it is useful if you ask your therapist which technique he or she uses. You may find it helpful to speak to another person who has had similar problems with alcohol, drugs or gambling, as this gives you a good idea of how difficult the problem really was and why therapy is needed now.

Q: where is the best place to go for help?\nA: To get the help you need, make sure you talk to people who are experienced in treating alcohol and drug related problems - most health centres will offer specialist services for you. For more information about where you can get help visit www.alcoholhelpguide.org.uk

Please see our page on Where to Get Help.","Psychotherapy, in general, refers to the process of understanding and changing a patient's thoughts, feelings, behavior, or beliefs. It may involve individual therapy (such as for depression), group therapy (for schizophrenia), family counseling, or group psychology.\r


Q: how long does it take to get better from an illness?\nA: The number one reason patients say they don't want to change their symptoms is that they fear that doing so will make them worse. This belief can be due either to fear of relapse or not wanting to acknowledge problems to themselves. There is no way to predict if a person with an anxiety disorder will have a good outcome during treatment. Some people do get better more quickly than others. When someone says he/she is getting better, however, it means that the anxiety has decreased significantly. Some people also believe it takes time to heal an illness. Others think a person must be miserable before they feel better. In fact, anxiety disorders are treatable. If you're convinced you'll never feel better, find another way to cope. But, if you know you're going to get better, you need to accept your life as normal and start taking steps toward recovery.


Q: what causes anxiety?\nA: Anxiety disorders occur when the body releases stress hormones into the bloodstream called catecholamines. These hormones trigger many different types of chemical reactions within the brain, such as the release of adrenaline into the blood stream. This increases heart rate and breathing and prepares the body for action. While there are several possible causes of anxiety, two are most common:1) Trauma2) A chronic disease\u00a0 \u003c\/span\u003e

Trauma: A traumatic experience, such as sexual assault or abuse, can lead to a wide range of physiological changes in the body. For example, while some memories might fade over time, other memories may last longer than usual and become harder to forget. Other memories may be affected by sleep deprivation, causing memory gaps. Nightmares can increase the amount of stress hormone levels in the brain and produce anxiety. Trauma often occurs in childhood, but can happen at any age. For example, individuals who were abused as children may develop PTSD. Symptoms of trauma include physical pain, irritability, flashbacks, nightmares, increased arousal, and sleep disturbances. As a result, the body starts producing chemicals like cortisol to prepare the body for fight-or-flight responses. Cortisol works by releasing energy stored up","the process of changing your thoughts and beliefs so they align with reality. In simple terms, it's about changing yourself to better fit reality.

Q: I've seen that as a tool for the person who has a negative thought. But what does that do for me?

A: It's all in how you view that thought! If you think of that thought as something negative, then you'll keep repeating those thoughts until you stop thinking them. The more that you see that thought as a positive thing (instead of an annoying annoyance), the easier it will be for you to let go of it."
54,Q: What does multiple sclerosis diagnosis include? What does it change?\nA:,"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, relapsing disease of the central nervous system. It affects the peripheral nerves and the brain. Its symptoms are often progressive and non-specific. The cause of MS is still unknown; however, genetic factors have been associated with an increased risk for developing the disease. There are three primary groups that are affected by MS: 1) People who develop the disease between ages 20 and 40; 2) people who have had the disease longer than 10 years prior to their symptoms manifesting (and who may have other underlying disorders); 3) individuals who develop MS after experiencing an event such as an injury or trauma during adolescence, young adulthood, or middle age. When you talk about multiple sclerosis, people typically think of what happens in the early stages of the disease. For example, if you experience numbness, tingling, burning, heat, weakness, or any other symptoms of MS that last more than two weeks, then your doctor will likely diagnose the condition. If this occurs, then you will usually be referred to a neurologist at a hospital or clinic where they can examine your spine and other structures using X rays or MRI scans to determine exactly what's happening inside your body. You'll also undergo tests such as MRI and CAT scan to assess how well your spinal cord controls your muscles and other organs. This is important because many times, patients do not fully recover from their MS symptoms until later on. In most cases, symptoms improve over time to allow a person with MS to move around, dress themselves, eat and drink normally, use the toilet, and communicate. But there are some situations in which MS symptoms persist for months or even years, such as those caused by spinal stenosis, tumors, infections, or damage to the optic nerve in the eye. With each new symptom you experience, we'll need to determine whether it's related to MS. One way that we might confirm a diagnosis of MS would be to perform an MRI that shows abnormalities in the parts of the brain responsible for coordinating movement. However, only about half of all people who have MS show signs or symptoms that could indicate that they've actually got the disease. Even when a patient does have symptoms that suggest MS, they're not always obvious to others and can't always be diagnosed accurately. This is why finding out if you have MS will require an ongoing investigation. Most often, your symptoms come and go over the course of a year or more but sometimes they just keep coming. And although we know that the onset of symptoms often varies from person to","Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease. It's a collection of symptoms caused by the immune system attacking and damaging your brain cells, called myelin sheath, which surround your neurons. The body responds to this damage by producing antibodies that attack these damaged nerves in the CNS (central nervous system), called demyelinating lesions. These lesions are caused by the buildup of abnormal proteins within nerve fibers, and they can lead to loss of motor skills and vision. Because MS progresses over time and often involves progressive weakness or paralysis, you may not recognize any changes to your physical condition for several years after the onset of symptoms. At times, doctors will only notice progression from one manifestation of MS to another during a comprehensive neurologic evaluation. For example, if there are no clear changes at first, but then one day a person experiences blurred vision or slurred speech and later develops trouble speaking and swallowing, an MRI might be ordered to confirm the diagnoses. A second MRI may also be needed to determine if the worsening features have progressed into full-blown MS.

What is the cost of living with multiple sclerosis?\nA: The annual average cost of living is $15,000 for a single individual. An individual with multiple sclerosis generally spends about half their income on caregiving expenses and expenses related to transportation, food, clothing, medications, and other costs associated with living with the disease. Health insurance premiums typically account for nearly 90 percent of these expenses, while government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid cover the balance of the bill. If you're a low-income worker without health insurance, this cost increases substantially. In 2015, the median household income for individuals who did not have employer-sponsored coverage was $44,721, and the median family income was just under $90,000. People with severe chronic diseases often need special assistance from health professionals, including nurses, social workers, dietitians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, chiropractors, speech pathologists, etc., because of the significant financial burden associated with managing their disabilities. While having multiple sclerosis can drastically reduce an individual's earning potential, it doesn't mean that a person cannot afford to live a healthy lifestyle. Many people find ways to make work and social life possible despite limitations due to MS. If you want to learn more about how you could benefit financially from MS treatment, visit the U.S. National Multiple Sclerosis Society website or call 1-800-977-5626.

How much does it take to treat multiple sclerosis?","Multiple sclerosis is the most common type of neurologic disease, affecting more than 1.2 million Americans. The course and severity of MS varies greatly from person to person, but there are three stages. In stage I, people with MS experience problems with balance, vision or speech. Sometimes they lose their sense of smell, taste or touch; at other times, they have severe difficulty swallowing. In stage II, a person may lose ability to move in all ways, including walking, seeing, hearing, talking or thinking clearly. At this point, people may start having problems breathing (bronchiectasis) or develop damage to nerve cells that controls muscles. Stage III includes all cases. Symptoms can range from mild to disabling. If you are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis as an adult, you will be evaluated by your physician for any symptoms you might have developed during the previous 12 months, which could indicate the onset of MS. For some people with MS, there is no need for further evaluation. People who do not receive appropriate treatment often become disabled within five years of diagnosis. Other disorders that can affect multiple sclerosis symptoms include stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease.

Eating disorders are also common. Eating disorders are characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating, disordered eating behavior, restrictive dieting or weight loss. They typically begin before puberty and continue into adulthood. Many people with eating disorders have some level of functioning in everyday life. However, many others suffer from serious health consequences due to poor mental health and social well-being. One in five women (20 percent) report binge eating in her lifetime, compared to one in 20 men (5 percent). More than 40 percent of female adolescents (ages 15–19) suffer from binge eating disorder. Women are affected 2–3 times more frequently than men (4 percent vs 2 percent). Binge eating can lead to significant emotional distress, low self esteem, depression and anxiety disorders. About 50 percent of patients with bulimia nervosa have co-occurring eating disorders. These disorders usually begin between age 14 and 18. A survey conducted by UCLA found that about 25 percent of teenagers had been involved in a food-related activity that resulted in damage to their body. Nearly half of those surveyed said they were bullied because of their weight. Obesity can cause complications such as high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, as well as reduced quality of life.

How is chronic fatigue syndrome defined? CFS is a poorly understood condition.","Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks and destroys myelin, a fatty covering of nerve fibers that allows our nerves to transmit signals. The attack on myelin causes pain, loss of balance, vision problems, bladder problems, dizziness, fatigue, numbness, tingling, sensitivity to light, and paralysis. (1) \nB: What are the symptoms?\nA: The typical symptom is burning sensations in and around the skin; often this occurs within the limbs. Many people also have numbness or tingling in the arms, legs, hands and feet as well as weakness, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. (2) \nC: How common is MS?\nA: There was one reported case of MS during each year of childhood until 2007. In 2008 there were two reported cases. It has been estimated that there are approximately 300 million people worldwide with MS. (3) \nD: Do doctors diagnose MS by looking for lesions?\nA: Doctors do not usually look for lesions but can spot other health problems associated with MS such as sensory problems, hearing loss, muscle rigidity, joint pain, depression, sleep problems, anxiety, suicidal ideation, social isolation, mood swings, and difficulty concentrating. (4) \nE: Does MS affect children differently than adults?\nA: No. Children who develop MS at any age will show all the signs and symptoms listed above. However, when diagnosed before school age, children tend to make fewer changes and may be more likely to attend school normally. (5) \nF: Who develops MS first? What triggers the onset of MS?\nA: Although no single cause has been identified, most studies indicate that early life factors such as genetic predisposition and environmental toxins play major roles in determining risk for developing MS later in life. (6) \nG: Can I avoid MS symptoms if I'm living a healthy lifestyle?\nA: It depends on your individual response to treatment. If you're taking medication then this is unlikely to be effective because it alters brain chemistry. Even if you take an anti-inflammatory drug, your levels of inflammation and autoantibodies will continue to rise until your treatment is completed. If you have healthy blood pressure, cholesterol, thyroid function and blood sugar, you should not need treatment for MS unless you start to experience clinical symptoms such as numbness or tingling in your extremities or facial features. (7) \","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system. It affects approximately 5 million people worldwide and is characterized by motor neuron degeneration, resulting in weakness or paralysis on one side of your body, often affecting both arms and legs, along with cognitive difficulties such as difficulty walking, understanding speech and swallowing. MS can also affect vision and hearing. \r

The most common symptoms are muscle stiffness, fatigue, pain, loss of coordination, sleep disturbance, depression, and fatigue, which may be severe enough to prevent you from doing daily activities or cause significant functional limitations that limit your ability to perform everyday tasks. There may be other complications associated with MS that require additional treatment such as blindness or problems with movement and balance. In addition, there is currently no cure for MS. \r

You should seek medical care immediately if you experience any of these symptoms: sudden, unexplained weakness; numbness or tingling sensations; trouble seeing, including darkening of vision; hearing impairment or disability (difficulty understanding spoken language); trouble swallowing; shortness of breath (dyspnea); breathing problems, particularly when coughing; or other signs of a respiratory infection. \r

Diagnosis of MS can be complicated because many patients do not know they have MS until their condition becomes disabling and becomes life threatening. This can make early detection difficult even with rapid diagnostic testing such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\r

There are several ways to determine whether or not you have MS. These include physical examination and laboratory tests such as a blood test for antibodies to auto-antibodies, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and a spinal tap exam. Also, you will need to provide information about medication use (including current dose, frequency of use, and duration) and use of medications you took prior to onset of symptoms. If you were diagnosed with MS within the last six months, you will likely need further evaluation by your physician. However, some individuals who have been undiagnosed for years and show very little symptom symptoms still have advanced lesions in the brain caused by MS. Diagnosing MS at this point may result in misdiagnoses. Even after this period, if there are other symptoms present, or if you have other underlying health conditions, you must continue to see your doctor until you receive a definitive diagnosis. You may need to undergo additional evaluations throughout your lifetime if new evidence emerges during this time.\r

Because MS causes widespread damage to nerve cells (neur","Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disease characterized by the presence of relapsing-remitting (RR) and secondary progressive (SP) lesions. These lesions are located in the brain, spinal cord or both. In addition to these two main categories of MS, there are other types which do not meet the diagnostic criteria for either RR or SP but may be associated with them. There are also some people who have no neurologic symptoms but who develop SP lesions. A person can have one type of MS and another type at different times. For example, someone with RRMS may experience occasional episodes of disability over the course of their lifetime while someone with SP may only experience one episode of disability during that same period. \nB: This is important because many doctors will suggest one type of MS as being better than the other. Many times this can lead patients into thinking they are doing all right but it doesn't take much evidence to show that you really aren't! \nC: It's important to understand that the way we diagnose a particular kind of MS depends on which part of the body is involved. For example, the CNS has been identified as the primary site of damage in the more common forms of MS. This means that in order to determine whether your MS affects the CNS at all, your doctor should see if they get enough information from the MRI to find any abnormalities. If they don't get enough information then they may recommend further tests. The most common type of MRIs used are called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI involves taking a series of images of each part of the brain with a specially designed machine known as a T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These machines detect changes in blood flow in specific parts of the brain, thereby identifying where the brain cells are damaged or injured and how the effects vary between persons. DTI measures the amount of fluid in the brain and can therefore reveal how large areas of the brain have become inflamed and distorted. Some doctors use DTI scans together with brain scans made using a technique called diffusion tensor imaging to look specifically for SP lesions. With SP lesions, it becomes clear where in the brain the affected area actually lies since they produce characteristic patterns on MRI. To identify SP lesions, SP specialist specialists use an MRI machine called a MEG and measure how much water flows through a small hole on the side of the head where the SP lesion can be seen. This allows them to distinguish between SP lesions and other kinds of MS and to make sure they're diagnosing","Multiple sclerosis diagnosis includes any one of the following:1) A report from a physician or other health professional that an individual with MS has lesions in their brain, spinal cord, and/or optic nerves2) An MRI scan of the head (with or without contrast)3) Any test for inflammation or degeneration of the brain and/or spinal cord4) Other tests, including blood work5) The results of a clinical examination by another health care provider6) In some cases, the results of all these tests may be combined into a single report7) A patient's self-report8) A person who is not a health care provider9) In rare instances, the symptoms may cause confusion.10) If you have had multiple sclerosis, your doctor can provide more information about this condition. For example, your doctor may recommend further testing or surgery if your symptoms continue to get worse and are not improving within 4 weeks.11) You should contact your insurance company for specific information regarding your coverage.12) Your insurance will cover certain costs related to treating MS as long as the benefits exceed $50,000 per year.13) Medicare Part D covers both MS treatment and other treatments for people aged 55 years or older.14) The National Institutes of Health offers several different funds for funding research on MS.15) Many federal agencies offer support for medical research on multiple sclerosis, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).16) Some states also offer Medicaid programs for people with MS.17) All of these government funds pay for testing, procedures, medications, and services.18) Private insurers may reimburse you for treatment with MS drugs or devices when they're purchased through a private insurer under their reimbursement policies.19) Medication prices often vary greatly among insurance companies.20) Many patients find out about effective therapies only after trying them.21) Because your insurance company won't cover the cost of many MS treatments, some health care providers provide free or low-cost MS screening and testing for their own patients at no charge.22) The CDC recommends getting a second opinion before making major life changes like starting a new job or having children.23) People who develop a second disease after a first severe neurologic disease experience high rates of relapse.24) There is little evidence that taking medication","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition affecting the central nervous system. It affects about one in eight adults worldwide and about 400,000 Americans. The disease typically begins during childhood or adolescence and tends to strike younger individuals than those who have other diseases. It causes the death of nerve cells that control muscle movement, sensation, vision, and hearing. MS also affects women more often than men, and those with less severe symptoms tend not to seek treatment as aggressively. While many forms of MS affect similar areas on the brain, the most common form has affected around 50 million people worldwide over the past 30 years and is estimated to affect one-third of all U.S. patients between the ages of 40 and 60, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In this disease, the immune system attacks and destroys myelin sheaths — protective fatty tissue covering axons in neurons (nerve fibers). Myelination helps enable nerves to send messages through their circuits; without myelination, signals cannot be transmitted properly. By removing damaged myelin, MS destroys communication channels and sends the message ""we don't need you anymore."" Without myelinated tracts, the part of the spinal cord where muscles, sensory nerves, and the brain are located can no longer transmit information to the rest of the body. Thus, there is loss of strength and mobility of vital organs. For example, muscle weakness may result from difficulty breathing because of a lack of oxygen to the brain. These symptoms can become debilitating and even life threatening. Some research suggests that MS could someday develop into a progressive disorder. However, for now, the best way to manage symptoms is by taking medication called an anticoagulant, which lowers the level of blood clots in the arteries that supply the heart. This reduces blood pressure and improves circulation. Other medications, including antihistamines (drugs to treat allergic reactions), anti-seizure drugs (drugs used to prevent seizures when they occur), and steroids, target inflammation. Together these medications help regulate cell function, reduce pain, and protect the body's own tissues from damage. Although some symptoms of MS can improve after treatment, others never go away. That means MS affects a person's daily ability to perform everyday tasks such as walking, climbing stairs, talking, eating, bathing, dressing, etc. Many people with MS suffer extreme fatigue, headaches, depression, confusion, memory problems, trouble concentrating, sleep disturbances, abnormal bowel movements, nausea, dizziness, tremors, tingling sensations","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disease characterized by the presence of signs and symptoms including weakness, loss of mobility, and numbness or tingling sensations. MS affects approximately 1 in 100 adults throughout their lives, with an average age at onset of 55 years old. The vast majority (90%) of people diagnosed with MS are women; however men can develop the condition as well, especially after 30 years of age. Most cases of MS are preceded by an abnormally slow brain growth that causes a buildup of scar tissue. This leads to progressive damage over time, eventually leading to the formation of a lesion known as an active lesions. After this lesion forms, nerve fibers start to deteriorate, resulting in loss of function and sensory input from the affected area. MS also leads to disability because of severe muscle spasms and other symptoms. There are three types of MS: relapsing-remitting, secondary, and primary (primary is when there is no clear cause for the initial attack). Relapsing-remitting MS is marked by recurring attacks of fatigue that last several days to weeks. These may be preceded by a period where activity levels are low but then increase gradually. During these periods of increased activity, nerve cells become damaged as they try to repair themselves. Typically, relapses occur every 2 to 8 months, although they can happen more frequently if the immune system starts attacking healthy nerve cells. Secondary MS occurs in patients who have had an early relapse and whose symptoms continue to worsen. Primary MS is characterized by recurrent, often disabling attacks that begin suddenly and persist even with treatment. People with primary MS do not experience debilitating bouts of fatigue and typically recover fully within 5 to 10 years of diagnosis. Some people will need to take medication for life to control symptoms (regimen), while others will live full lives without any disability. A person's risk for developing secondary MS increases significantly during adolescence and young adulthood, which explains why so many people with MS end up living with the disease into later life. In addition, some people are born with autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and scleroderma, among others. For example, people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are twice as likely to get MS. While IBD itself does not directly contribute to MS, some studies suggest that certain foods may trigger MS","Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disease in which the immune system attacks and destroys the brain, spinal cord, optic nerve (eye) and other parts of the central nervous system. It also affects many of your muscles, joints and skin. The damage caused by MS can be permanent if untreated. Treatment focuses on relieving pain and controlling symptoms. Some people are cured with drugs such as interferon-alpha and glatiramer acetate. Others live with their disability for years. A person may have multiple conditions at one time. These include: inflammation in the brain

spinal cord compression causing paralysis or even death

muscle spasms resulting from muscle degeneration

inflammation in the blood vessels that supply the brain and nerves

blood clots, which cause more problems when they break off and travel to the lungs or heart

damage to the nerves surrounding the eyes called retinitis pigmentosa, which causes vision loss The most important thing for you to know about multiple sclerosis is that you do not need to worry about having it any time soon. There's no cure available yet; however, advances in treatment make it less likely that you will develop MS. In some cases, treatments help slow down the progression of MS. If you have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, it's best to talk with your doctor about what kind of treatment works best for you. You'll find information about MS treatment options in Your Health Care Guide."
55,Q: How to manage multiple sclerosis?\nA:,"You can do it. The best way is through the use of medications and lifestyle changes. In my experience, the most effective method of managing MS is an annual physical exam, which helps you track down any conditions that might be contributing to symptoms or cause problems. It's also important to remember that there are many factors that go into how a person with MS feels — like whether or not they've been exposed to chemicals in their environment or their food, for example, which could make them more sensitive to nerve damage or lead to other neurological issues. And while some treatments work well for certain people who have MS, others don't. So talk to your doctor about which ones work best for you.

Brett McKay: That sounds great. I'll put this together and see if I'm on time today. Yeah, I want to ask one more question before we wrap up, too, and it comes from Dr. Thomas D. Smith, MD. He says, ""I'm having trouble making sense of the word 'chronic.' Does chronic mean something like long term?"" If so, then what does the definition of chronic mean here?

Dr. Daniel Lieberman: I think a lot of people have heard that phrase because they hear it used when talking about people who smoke cigarettes, but it means different things depending on the context. One context is that it refers to someone whose condition has lasted for at least a year, and that's very specific as far as the disease goes. We're talking about chronic pain and arthritis and neuropathic pain — all these kinds of chronic diseases. Chronic often means longer than a year, though, and I would consider that just another way of saying prolonged. That doesn't necessarily mean you had MS for years or decades. Someone who has been diagnosed with MS will typically have it for a lifetime, whereas someone without MS may only have had symptoms for years or even decades. This is why MS is called the second oldest known disease in humans.

You could say that chronic pain and arthritis have been around longer, but they have different causes. They're not caused by the same thing. For instance, back pain can get worse over time, which leads to inflammation; this causes pain. But chronic pain is usually a result of stress, and it is largely genetic. Some of us inherit the gene for chronic pain, and some of us just haven't been able to learn to cope with stress properly yet. There are various theories of why we carry some genes for chronic pain, and we know that people","\o/ Q: Is it possible to use an oral contraceptive pill (oral contraceptives) or other hormone-based contraceptive method as a way of managing MS symptoms and disease activity in women with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS)?\u2014In particular, I am interested in whether the hormonal contraceptives used for preventing pregnancy would be effective in treating MS.\r

It should not replace consultations with a qualified health care professional.[/color][/b]","My experience with MS is that the more you use it, the better. There are ways of managing your symptoms and you will need them. A number of drugs can be used. They include drugs that target inflammation in the brain and spinal cord, such as riluzole or methotrexate; those that affect metabolism in the central nervous system (CNS), including carbamazepine, phenytoin and others; and those that treat glial cells that support the immune system, which includes cyclosporine, lamotrigine, cyclophosphamide, cycloserine and others.

What I have done for MS is to keep my body healthy by taking a variety of vitamins, minerals, herbs and other supplements. I also do some massage therapy at home. For example, if I feel pain on one side of the neck, I massage that area twice daily until I don't get any tenderness. The muscles relax then tighten up again over time. That helps reduce the swelling. But there are several different forms of massage that work best for me — manual, electrical and acupressure (a type of traction). You should talk to your physician about the kind that works best for you.

I am very diligent about eating right and exercising regularly. I avoid hot baths, saunas and steam rooms because they can worsen the symptoms and increase the risk of infection. However, people who suffer from multiple sclerosis often report benefits from deep-tissue massage. As long as we learn how to control our bodies properly through diet, exercise and vitamin supplementation, there is no reason why people cannot live life as normally as possible while still having their needs met.","You can't control MS. But you can take steps that will help.

MS is a disease of the brain and spinal cord, and each person has his or her own individual risk factors for developing it. The most important way to prevent MS is to maintain a healthy weight by eating right, exercising regularly, taking medicines as prescribed and avoiding tobacco use.","You'll have a good time, but it is not easy. For example, you need to be aware of your symptoms and make sure they are in balance with other things that can impact the condition; for instance, eating well and taking your medication regularly. If you're able to get by without all this, life will go on as normal.

Q: What about the future?\nA: Your diagnosis means there's nothing left to do but wait until people who know better start telling you what to do. The prognosis for MS varies considerably depending on when you were diagnosed, so the sooner you begin treatment, the better chances you will have. However, as long as you continue to take your medicine you should be fine.","I have two questions for you about managing MS. First, what is the process of managing Multiple Sclerosis and how can it be improved? Second, if you were able to make a living from MS once, what would your business model or other options be now that you are no longer able to work? Thanks!

A: Hi Michelle. MS affects my right side so it's hard to keep up with all aspects of business; however, I am trying to focus on building my online store as well as working with some small companies. As far as jobs go, in order to get my job back I'm going to need a new application for every position. So, there will definitely be a big adjustment for me in terms of employment but things do look good. It really does depend on your industry though. Most positions available at most large firms require a degree in something that can't be easily replaced by software. In addition, many people with MS have a full time job at home or in another field where they aren't taking care of their health. When I was diagnosed (in 2009) I knew very little about MS and didn't know how to market myself or prepare for work. It took several years before I started talking with others about my situation (I had an MS support group back then). I think it's best if you talk to others who've been through similar situations because you may find that you're not alone in your struggles. Good luck!

Q: I have three questions for you about MS - first off, What is the history of MS and who is affected? How long has this disease existed? How does the illness progress from mild to severe symptoms? Lastly, why is it still such a mystery?

A: Thank you for taking the time to read our blog. MS is not an ""old"" disease like polio, or HIV. This condition was discovered over 100 years ago when Dr John Hunter discovered a protein that caused lesions to form around nerve cells in his patients' brains. Since then we've learned more and more about how the disease progresses over time. The reason the virus causes such devastating disease today is because of its ability to escape from immune system cells known as T-cells which are responsible for controlling infection. There is currently no cure for MS. Once a person develops symptoms, the entire body becomes infected. Treatment consists of medication to control the inflammation and prevent further damage to the brain and nervous system. The cause of MS is unknown so doctors treat everyone differently; there isn't one way","My treatment plan includes immunotherapy. I get all the injections and follow-up visits at a clinic in Toronto that specializes in treating MS patients.\NI know how hard it is to find doctors who understand your condition, but with the help of my own neurologist, I have been able to gain independence as well as better control of symptoms.

Q: What's your approach when you're not feeling well? Do you take medication or herbal supplements?\ nA: No medications are necessary for me when I am not getting much sleep or eating very well. If I can't feel good right away, I ask myself, ""Is this due to stress?"" I try to be sure that I eat lots of fresh fruit and vegetables before bed. And if I'm unable to feel well later on during the day, then I make more time for exercise and rest. I also try to keep busy by working out regularly. It takes a lot of energy for me to move around so I make sure I stay active before going back to bed.


Q: You've said your life has changed significantly since you were diagnosed. What do you miss most about old days?\ nA: The flexibility to work whenever I want without having to worry about being locked into any job. I was never forced to choose between work and family commitments – I could always choose both!

And when I don't feel like doing anything, I just lie on my back in the bathtub while listening to some relaxing music or playing a video game. There aren't many things I enjoy doing more than spending quality time with my family. I love making sure they have an amazing holiday season because that is something no one should ever experience alone. I spend Christmas dinner together every year with my parents, aunties, cousins and friends and it feels like we really share our lives together.

My husband and children also enjoy seeing their mommy taking care of us. We have a special bond that goes beyond physical relationships. It makes each day easier.


Q: What advice would you give someone living with MS?\ nA: As long as I remain healthy, I believe I will continue to progress in whatever area I decide to focus on. One thing I learned early on is that you cannot force yourself to live a certain lifestyle, but rather learn how to adjust your health and lifestyle habits according to what works best for you. With this knowledge in mind, I hope to lead a healthier lifestyle even though I am aware that this may affect my","There are no specific ""disease-management"" protocols for MS; however, lifestyle changes and medication can help people live more fully with the disease. People who have MS should try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise most days, especially early in the day and after meals when the circulation is slowest. This will benefit their circulatory system and other organs as well. In addition, they should avoid heavy alcohol use and tobacco use, which increase the risk of developing MS.

A person may be diagnosed with MS only if there is a positive test result for an abnormal immune response called autoimmunity (see below). The initial screening tests used by doctors include:

The results of these tests come back quickly. It usually takes about 2 weeks from diagnosis to confirm that it's MS. If you have had symptoms or signs of MS before you were first tested and have recently been diagnosed, see your doctor again. Also call your doctor right away if you develop new problems such as weakness, pain or numbness in your arms or legs. These could mean you have another condition. You may need more tests.

How do I know if my body has the ""autoimmune"" reaction to my own proteins?

Doctors don't understand exactly what causes this reaction, but scientists believe they might involve a protein called interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) released by white blood cells in the body. IL1B has many different functions, including helping our bodies fight infection, fighting cancer, protecting against infections that can cause severe damage, and keeping inflammation under control. Scientists now think that some people with MS react to their own proteins because their immune systems attack them, creating inflammation. For example, scientists believe that IL1B plays a role in causing arthritis in some people with MS. However, some studies suggest that having high levels of IL1B doesn't necessarily lead to MS. Doctors aren't sure why some people don't react to their own proteins and others do. Some experts think that this type of autoimmune reaction occurs less often than people realize because most people with MS experience only short periods of severe illness during their lives.

Some research suggests that children and young adults with MS have a higher chance of developing MS as adolescents or young adulthood than children without MS. Scientists also think that older people who develop MS may have a greater risk of developing chronic illnesses later in life because their bodies are weakened, making them more vulnerable to infections and viruses. Other researchers suspect that the underlying cause of MS may change over","In my opinion, if you have MS and are not actively using medications or other therapies for your disease, then you should consider switching from the traditional pharmaceutical treatment of TNF inhibitors. If you want to try something new that may be more effective than existing treatments, you might benefit from trying a natural alternative such as turmeric (Curcuma longa).\N

Q: What is the best way to protect oneself against MS/TENSI?\nA: Although there are no proven studies that show any specific ways to prevent MS, I think it's important to recognize that it is very difficult to avoid the risk factors associated with MS by simply avoiding certain foods and behaviors that can trigger an immune response in susceptible individuals. For those who choose to take medication, I would recommend taking a low-dose version of the TNF inhibitor called diclofenac sodium (Voltaren), which only requires one tablet per day in addition to your standard multivitamins. One of the first steps toward managing MS is learning what triggers the symptoms of MS and how these triggers differ depending on the person's race, gender, and age. Taking care of yourself through diet and lifestyle changes will play a large role in helping you feel better during this time. There also is some evidence suggesting that dietary supplements can help reduce the inflammatory process when taken together with regular exercise, but further research needs to be done before we know whether or not this holds true.

Q: Can MS be reversed or mitigated by dietary measures alone?\nA: Yes. There is some evidence showing that eating more fiber, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, omega-3 fatty acids, and probiotics has been shown to improve the quality of life in people with MS.[7] I would recommend doing everything possible to incorporate these into your diet as well as to increase your intake of beneficial bacteria, which could be found naturally in yogurt or fermented foods. This means consuming probiotic products in addition to following a balanced diet, since both provide you with essential nutrients such as live bacteria. Many patients report that taking probiotics along with their medication actually helps to minimize side effects and reduce inflammation, so this idea of combining probiotic products with drugs is definitely worth exploring!\r

Q: Is there a difference between MS and CFS? \nA: No. Both conditions affect the brain and nervous system; however, they do not appear to share many characteristics. The major differences include the fact that people with MS tend to","This book is designed for those who have had multiple sclerosis (MS) and are ready to move on from the symptoms.

57,Q: multiple sclerosis stages phases\nA:,"a complete phase (not on CDR)B: an ongoing, partial phase (e.g., relapsing-remitting MS).

I was told that in my case of multiple sclerosis I have the first stage. Is it true? How long does this last for you?","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory demyelinating disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. It has an average survival rate of less than 10 years in developed countries; it can last for decades or even longer in developing countries. The disease starts with acute relapses that usually occur once or twice each month. After more months, some people develop secondary progressive MS, which begins when lesions progress to become permanent. In addition, patients with active relapsing-remitting MS may have neuropathic pain, muscle weakness, fatigue, dizziness, and numbness or tingling in their limbs, although these symptoms are not life threatening.B:

The condition is caused by damage to white matter tracts and axons throughout the brain. These tracts and axons transmit signals from one part of your body to another, allowing you to move and function normally.

C:

Your doctor will conduct a thorough physical examination and perform blood tests to look for signs of other medical conditions. Your family physician may refer you to other specialists who specialize in this area such as neurologists, radiologists, ophthalmologists, and psychiatrists.

D:

Your doctor's primary goal is to identify any underlying causes of MS and find out how they affect the progression of the disease. They will also evaluate your response to treatment and monitor how well you respond to medications. If your medical history shows other possible risk factors for MS, your doctor may recommend genetic testing for your susceptibility.

E:

Many different types of research studies have been conducted on MS since its discovery in the late 19th century. These studies include clinical trials (called ""phase I"" trials), observational studies (called ""phase II""), prospective cohort studies, and small randomized controlled trials. Each type of study has its own strengths and weaknesses. Researchers use several criteria to decide which one to follow first in order to determine whether a medication works best. For example, phase II trial participants take the drug for approximately three months and then see if they experience improvement over time. This strategy allows researchers to compare the effects of drugs against those of placebo treatments.

F:

There are currently no approved drugs designed specifically to treat MS. However, there are several types of therapies that help reduce inflammation that leads to nerve damage. These include corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory agents (like NSAIDs and acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin), and nutritional supplements like vitamins A, C, E","the stage of multiple sclerosis in which there is a gradual loss of muscle control, vision and speech. Q: Multiple Sclerosis? (MS) Q: When was my MS diagnosed? A: MS can be diagnosed at any age. It usually starts after age 25, although it may develop later than that. The earliest recorded case of MS occurred in 1834. Although the exact cause remains unknown, it appears to be linked to an immune system disorder called Epstein Barr virus (EBV). EBV is found in approximately one-third of all people with HIV infection.

How long does it take for multiple sclerosis to develop?

The first symptoms of MS generally appear between 20 and 30 years old. People who are young or very active tend to have more severe symptoms. In addition to being tired, they feel numbness and tingling throughout their body. They also often find themselves having difficulty walking. As time goes by, these sensations become progressively worse. By the time many people reach middle age, some of them have lost the ability to walk completely without assistance. Some patients lose the ability to speak altogether because they cannot recognize faces.

What causes multiple sclerosis?

There isn't one specific disease process that leads to MS. However, scientists believe that environmental factors play a role. For instance, exposure to certain chemicals and viruses, as well as genetic mutations that occur during early childhood, can lead to the development of autoimmune diseases such as MS. Scientists do not yet know why some people get sicker or die sooner from these illnesses.

How can I prevent multiple sclerosis?

Many common conditions can trigger MS. These include:

Radiation exposure – Radiation has been known to trigger MS before in some cases. Children born within two weeks of receiving large doses of radiation have developed MS at much higher rates than children born earlier in pregnancy.

– Radiation has been known to trigger MS before in some cases. Children born within two weeks of receiving large doses of radiation have developed MS at much higher rates than children born earlier in pregnancy. Smoking – Smoking increases your risk of developing MS, but not everyone who smokes develops MS. Research shows that smoking increases your chances of getting different types of cancer. You should try to quit if you want to avoid MS.

Read more about our treatment options here. You may also see links to other resources at the bottom of this page. If you do not see an active link below, we recommend that you read the information in our MS Treatment Information section.

We offer a range of MS drugs and treatments through different pharmaceutical companies:","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. The main symptoms are nerve damage, loss of muscle control and sensory impairment in the affected areas of the body. When these symptoms begin, they may be mild or severe and may require medical treatment and sometimes surgery to relieve their effects. A person with MS can have two or more different types of MS at any one time. There is no cure for MS, although there are treatments that improve the symptoms of people with this form of the disease. For example, medications known as ""biologic therapies"" include drugs taken by mouth and intravenously that target the brain and spinal cord where MS-causing proteins are present. Other medicines used to treat MS include beta blockers, which slow down the immune system's response to attacks from the white blood cells called T lymphocytes; immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids; anti-inflammatories like acetaminophen, ibuprofen and naproxen; and antibiotics such as erythromycin and tetracycline.

Q: What is the difference between ""phase"" of MS?\nA: Phase I (early stage) is characterized by widespread disability with no change in motor function; however, patients can walk and communicate after a few weeks of treatment; phase II (mid-stage), which occurs in people with milder or moderate symptoms, typically progresses to irreversible paralysis, but may be reversible. People who have progressed beyond this stage are called late-stage patients; they typically cannot move their legs as well as early-stage patients, but they still retain some ability to speak and breathe on their own. Finally, there's stage III, which is the most severe form of MS and usually only appears later in life. It is characterized by irreversible loss of muscle control and sometimes complete nerve damage. Patients are often left partially paralyzed or unable to feed themselves or dress themselves due to muscle spasms. Q: Where does my medication come from?\nA: The FDA requires manufacturers to list all ingredients found in any prescription drug. You can find a full listing of drugs at www.fda.gov/Drugs/.","Multiple sclerosis phase;A: the period of time during which a person with MS experiences symptoms such as severe fatigue, numbness in one or both extremities and loss of speech.

MS is divided into two main phases of activity: acute (also called relapsing-remitting) and chronic (also called progressive). The first stage can last from 3 to 12 months for most people. Symptoms are usually mild and improving over that time. As part of the course of MS, many times patients experience periods of remission where their disability disappears completely. However, some people will have persistent symptom flare ups lasting 6-12 months before they return to full health. A relapse occurs when you have new problems such as new symptoms, physical limitations, or changes in your quality of life.","Multiple sclerosis stage A=1; B=2; C=3; D=4; E=5; F=6 (see Table 3 for a list of all MS symptoms in the table); E and F are not used by clinical criteria.

B: Multiple sclerosis stage B = 1; C = 2; D = 3; E=4; F = 5 (see Table 4 for a list of all MS symptoms in the table). In addition, only these four conditions are considered to be early onsets or relapses (i.e., the beginning of a new phase within the same MS patient): (a) ICTP/CIDI: ICTP/cidI is the first (or lowest) stage of a progressive disease characterized by neurodegeneration that manifests clinically as fatigue, cognitive impairment, seizures, sensory disturbances, speech difficulties, and ataxia [30]. The CIDI includes three components, namely, myelin dysfunction, axonal atrophy, and demyelination. At least one component must occur before the third-stage diagnosis can be made. If more than two components are present, it is called the ""multiple sclerosis spectrum"" (MSS). All individuals with a primary MS case who have at least one of their CIDs, including CIDI, are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS), whereas those without any CIDs but who exhibit signs and symptoms consistent with the later onset of MS (known as secondary cases) are generally classified as having relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) [31]. Relapsing MS is defined by progression from a non-progressive to a progressive course during which time there may be changes in disability or other symptomatology over periods up to several years [32]. It has been suggested that RRMS patients might benefit from treatment strategies intended to slow down the rate of progressive change and thus hasten recovery from relapses rather than the aggressive management advocated for secondary cases [33]. However, some recent data suggest that in both primary and secondary cases, the prognosis after relapse is worse than expected even if the initial course of the disease is milder or less severe [34]. For instance, patients with an early onset of multiple sclerosis (ICD10 code C41–C42 or C47) were compared with those with earlier onset or a milder or less severely affected course (ICD10 codes R21–R23) [35]. They found that patients with early onset had better survival rates regardless of","""multiple sclerosis stage 1"" or ""stage I"" A-C, D-E A-B B-D C-F D-G E-H

2. Which is the best way to assess cognitive decline in people with MS?

The most common method for assessing cognitive function in people who have MS is a standardized neuropsychological test that measures memory and other thinking skills (1). The test consists of 30 questions on which you need to select answers correctly. The test can be given at different times during a person's course of MS and may be repeated after several months or years (2).

If you are concerned about your ability to learn new information in the short term, this type of test might not give you an accurate view of your overall functioning. If you do not score well on the test, you will need to take another assessment to evaluate how well you are developing language and speech abilities over time. This evaluation should include additional tests that measure problems such as attention, learning and problem solving ability. However, it is important to note that many factors can affect cognition, including age, treatment options, genetic susceptibility, medical condition, medication use and the environment (3).

In addition to a standard neuropsychological test, there are several tests that you can purchase online or from your doctor to monitor your progress. These can also help evaluate changes in your symptoms. Examples of available testing include:

• Neurocognitive Assessment Tool (NCT) by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

This tool assesses the ability of patients with multiple sclerosis to make decisions and interact in social situations.

• Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). This test helps determine whether individuals have mild cognitive impairment. It has been recommended for diagnosing mild cognitive impairment in people with MS.

• Functional Cognitive Activity Test (FCAT). This is an adapted version of the FCAT used by doctors in the United Kingdom.

You can review these tools on your own or ask a neurologist or psychologist to evaluate them. They may offer more specific instructions regarding when and where to administer each test and what scores to report.

If you are looking for a complete cognitive evaluation, please see www.mrs.org/dwsp/cep/cep_comparison_tool.html.

For some people with MS, cognitive issues may worsen if they experience chronic pain, fatigue, poor sleep quality, depression or loss"
58,Q: Risk to develop multiple sclerosis\nA:,"Yes, but there is no conclusive evidence that it causes MS. It may be a risk factor, or it could just be an effect of the disease itself. The chance of developing MS in someone who has not been exposed to environmental toxins is estimated at about 1 in 200 for those born after 1950.The only known link between exposure to pesticides and the development of MS is from organophosphates, a group of chemicals which include thiodicloprid (used on cotton) and chlorpyrifos (used on fruit trees). There are other possible links with organophosphate residues in fish such as tilapia and salmon which have high levels of these compounds. However, since this link has never been proven, it cannot be used to guide our current safety level for glyphosate residue in food.Q: Is there any connection between exposure to glyphosate and the development of cancer?A: No. Glyphosate does not appear to be carcinogenic when used according to directions on label. There appears to be very little evidence for any possible association. We do know that some people can become sensitive to certain foods when they use glyphosate. While we don't recommend avoiding all fruits and vegetables because of the herbicide residues, it would be wise to limit your consumption if you're concerned about potential health risks.","Yes, but not as high as MS.

Question 4: How much do you know about this?

A: I am aware that the disease can affect people from different ethnic groups; for example, there is a small amount of evidence suggesting an association with Ashkenazi Jews and lower risk of developing MS. However, we are trying to understand what this means in terms of overall risk of developing MS in different racial/ethnic populations [ref ].


The best way to learn more about your individualized treatment plan might be to contact your doctor or an MS support group. To find out if you have any existing symptoms of MS, ask your health care provider. You may want to consider taking tests to check for MS such as these:

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) test

Blood test for antibodies against B-cell leukemia (BCL-2) and CCR5

Treatment of MS: What do we mean by ""treatment""?


In general, we refer to treatments used for the treatment of MS as ""medications."" These include:

Medication to slow the progression of MS

Medicines to treat MS symptoms

Therapies designed to help control the symptoms of MS

Medical devices intended to treat MS

We also offer medications and therapies developed by researchers at the National Institute on Aging and other institutions to treat MS. Because these are new drugs and cannot currently be patented, they must be purchased through insurance companies without cost sharing or benefit eligibility requirements. For more information on how these medicines work and their benefits, please see Medication Guide for People With Multiple Sclerosis: Treatments and Devices.


How does one take the medication described above?


If you are prescribed any medication, follow all directions exactly as instructed by your physician. Do not stop using any medication without first talking to your healthcare provider. If needed, start treatment after completing 7 consecutive days of taking the medicine (this will usually occur within 10 to 14 days). Follow all directions precisely, including dosage, frequency, length, and frequency of doses. Never double dose. When you stop taking one medication, do not begin taking another medication at the same time. Do not change your dosing schedule or frequency or try to cut down or quit your medication suddenly. This could cause side effects or make it harder to quit. The most common side effect associated with stopping or changing medications is weight gain. Please contact your healthcare provider immediately if you notice signs of increased appetite while taking your","A risk factor for developing MS.

Risk factors include:

Age, which is related to the development of inflammation (arteriosclerosis) and also a marker of disease severity;

Gender;

Race;

Number of siblings; and

Genetics.

The researchers note that some people do not have any known risk factors for MS and others may be at increased risk due to certain genetic or environmental risks.

""Understanding how other health conditions such as obesity can increase the risk of MS provides an opportunity to design better strategies to prevent MS,"" said Dr. Joseph E. Lai, senior author on the paper and director of the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research in Boston.

Study Information","Risk is greater in people with MS who have developed the disease before age 30. There are currently no effective therapies for MS, but people who survive their initial attack may eventually live longer and be less likely to develop other diseases. The risk of developing multiple sclerosis can vary greatly from person to person. For example, one study suggests that about 10 percent of people diagnosed with the disease during a first attack will experience another; however, there has been little research on this topic (1).


The following is a brief summary of some possible risks for MS:

• A recent study at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio examined the lifetime risks of developing MS as well as those of death due to other causes for 1,566 people living in a general population. In general, the researchers found that MS was more common among men than women, younger persons compared with older ones, white individuals compared with non-white individuals, and African-American individuals compared with Caucasians or Asian Americans (2). The overall rates of dying from all causes were similar between male and female patients, regardless of race. However, MS patients had lower mortality rates from heart disease and stroke than did controls and were not more likely to die of cancers or other causes (3). This study also showed that while the incidence of MS increased in women throughout life, it decreased more sharply after age 40 than did that of the other causes of death studied.


For more information about the relationship between MS and cardiovascular disease, see the article ""Cerebrovascular Disease and Multiple Sclerosis"" (4).

• The American Academy of Neurology recommends avoidance of tobacco products including cigarettes and smokeless tobacco because they increase the risk of developing lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (5). Additionally, smoking increases the risk of several serious health problems related to tobacco use, including an increased risk of diabetes mellitus, certain types of leukemia and lymphoma, and depression (6).


Smoking appears to affect MS differently depending on whether people have already experienced MS or have never had MS (7). It also affects how often and when people relapse after stopping smoking (8).


People with MS are generally considered to be at high risk for developing COPD. Smoking may exacerbate symptoms of COPD such as wheezing, coughing up phlegm, chest tightness, and shortness of breath (9,10), which could lead someone with MS to engage in even heavier smoking habits (11,12).","It is not known whether multiple sclerosis develops after exposure to radiation.

B: The risk of developing multiple sclerosis depends on a number of factors including the amount and type of radiation exposure, the person's age and other conditions that may be present at the time of exposure (such as cancer), and the individual's genetic susceptibility and/or the location of their brain lesions. In addition, several types of chronic diseases can increase the likelihood of developing MS (for example, obesity, diabetes, stroke, or certain viral infections). If you have any questions about the safety of radiation for treating MS, talk with your doctor or nurse.

Q: How does radiation affect my bones?

A: Radiation affects bone mineral density in several ways: The body uses calcium from our food and drink to build strong bones. When we receive too much ionizing radiation, some of this calcium gets deposited into the bloodstream, where it can cause harmful effects. The most serious form of bone damage occurs when calcium accumulates in soft tissue such as cartilage, which becomes brittle, breaks down, and causes pain. The second-most common way bone loss occurs from radiation is during surgery. For example, during a mastectomy, patients who undergo X-rays are at high risk because they're exposed to ionizing radiation. After radiation treatment, people who had previously received bone-sparing surgery also are at higher risk because they'll need to replace these lost pieces of bone and should seek medical attention immediately if they experience any problems. Also, while many cancer treatments involve using radiation to destroy diseased cells, the amount of radiation used for treating solid tumors may not reach all of the cancerous cells. This means more normal healthy cells will be destroyed by radiation, increasing risk of cancer.

Q: I was given a shot of iodine. Does it work?

A","Yes.

Q: Can I be injected with an autologous CD4+ T cell in the same procedure?

A: No, only one T cell is necessary per procedure.

Q: What happens if a patient's immune system does not respond well to an antibody treatment (autoimmunity)?

A: After receiving therapy for autoimmunity, patients should be monitored closely and may need more frequent courses of immunotherapy. They are also advised to avoid travel to areas where anti-vaccine movements have been reported or to take precautions against infection during their travels.","Yes

Possible side effects of SAVY

SARMS are not a good substitute for actual SARMS. They can cause an allergic reaction or the body reacts poorly and causes an adverse reaction. The following is one example.

Case 1: A 22-year-old male had received his first dose of SAVY, but his first dose was delayed by 12 hours due to an allergic reaction. During this time, he developed hives which caused him to stop taking his medication. He continued on his SARMS without incident until after two months had passed. On returning to SARMs, he experienced symptoms of hives (excessive itching) with no fever and increased urination that lasted 5 days. Two days later, he developed difficulty breathing in severe distress. He went to the emergency room where tests showed he suffered from acute respiratory failure. The only sign of cardiac activity was a small heart murmur. His initial EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy and was elevated for sinus rhythm. His serum TSH was 2.0 mIU/ml while his resting blood pressure was 106 mmHg. One month after receiving SAVY, he returned to his baseline health. However, after five weeks of being off SARMs, his symptoms started back up causing him to go to the emergency department again. Tests revealed that despite having been completely off SARMs for four weeks, his level of TSH was still 3.1 mIU/ml and his resting blood pressure was 130 mmHg. His EKG also showed right ventricular hypertrophy. After six weeks of SARM use, he regained all strength in his legs and was able to walk unassisted. These were all the symptoms previously present when he began using SARMs, but they did not return during followup after he stopped using SARMs.

These are examples of side effects reported by people who have used SARMs.

How will I know if my body has become sensitized to SARMs?

You may be sensitive to SARMs even though you never experience any negative side effects. You may feel like your skin is burning or tingling after taking SARMs. You may have low cortisol levels for no apparent reason, even though you normally have high cortisol levels. If these symptoms continue after you stop using SARMs, then your body may be developing sensitivity to them. This could lead to serious problems such as rashes, eczema","Yes

In this study, the researchers found that people with MS had a slightly higher risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and diabetes. They also noted that a high body mass index was associated with an increased risk for other health problems, including cancer and neurological disorders.

""Overall, our findings support the concept that obesity may be considered in the differential diagnosis and treatment of patients with MS,"" write the authors, ""as they are more likely than lean individuals to have several comorbidities.""

They note that their data suggest that some patients with MS would benefit from weight loss therapy, either through bariatric surgery or lifestyle changes.","0.00

Q: Is there an effective treatment for MS?\u00a0A: No.

Q: What are some of the side effects that people experience?\rA: Side effects are mild and include fatigue, loss of appetite, dry mouth (may be unpleasant), headaches and dizziness.

Q: Will my body's own immune system damage my brain or spinal cord if I have MS? A: It depends on how severe your symptoms are and what type of MS you have. If they're moderate, then it should not harm your body's own immune system but may trigger a reaction from your body's own anti-inflammatory response.

Cognitive Functioning Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis \u2013 Multiple Sclerosis: Causes and Treatment Q: How does this disease impact cognitive function? A: Cognitive impairment can occur even when a person has no signs or symptoms. In fact, up to 75% of patients with MS will show evidence of cognitive dysfunction over time. Q: Can you think clearly after having MS? A: MS is a progressive neurological disorder affecting nerve cells throughout the body. Many doctors believe that MS causes changes in the way the brain processes sensory information, leading to difficulties focusing attention and making decisions. People with MS often struggle with memory problems, difficulty concentrating, lack of motivation, anxiety and depression. Some of these symptoms improve with treatment, especially for those who have milder forms of MS. Q: How do I know which form of MS I have? A: Most people with MS first get diagnosed as RRMS, a subtype that affects young adults. More than half of people with RRMS eventually develop relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Some people with MS don't get any warning signs until later in life; however, many people have symptoms before their 50s or 60s. Symptoms can range from poor eye vision or balance problems, trouble walking, trouble speaking or understanding speech, slow reflexes and seizures, to weakness in one arm or leg, numbness or tingling in another part of the body, or paralysis of a limb or arms. There are other types of MS that affect different parts of the body, and many have similar symptoms. When people first start to notice problems, doctors ask them to complete a questionnaire called the MS Self Assessment Questionnaire (MS-SAQ) to help determine whether MS"
59,Q: long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis\nA:,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS), the most common neurological disorder, affects approximately 1.2 million Americans; one in five patients will have symptoms of MS at some time during their lifetime, and the disease is often misdiagnosed and undertreated. Symptoms vary widely across different forms of the disease. For example, patients with optic neuritis may experience pain, dizziness or loss of vision. The condition may also include fatigue, impaired coordination, weakness, numbness, tingling, or aching muscles, headaches, anemia, nausea, fever, skin rash, nerve damage or paralysis. Patients with myasthenia gravis may feel muscle weakness, difficulty walking, balance problems, sleep disturbances, or hallucinations. In addition to symptoms, individuals with MS exhibit changes in their bodies that are unique from those who do not suffer from the disease. These physical changes can be caused by the disease itself, by medications taken for it, or by other factors. Some of these conditions may be treated using various treatments, including steroids or immune system therapy. It has been estimated that there are as many as 3.3 million people living with MS worldwide.

Q: what are the major causes of MS?


a: The precise cause of MS remains unknown. As previously stated, researchers have identified several possible causes, each having a role in the development of the disease. However, research conducted over the past 50 years has only demonstrated a link between certain types of inherited genetic mutations in genes called RPE65 proteins and the risk for developing MS. Other genetic predispositions may play a role in the progression of the disease.

Q: how does the brain get damaged?


a: Damage occurs within cells lining the central nervous system, specifically in areas involved in the control of movement, sensation, memory and cognition. Examples of this type of injury include damage to the dendrites of neurons — small branches of nerve cells that receive signals from other cells — which leads to abnormal activity in the neurons' axons. Researchers believe that this activity ultimately results in increased cell death, inflammation, and neuronal dysfunction.

Q: how is MS diagnosed?


a: A doctor will examine your medical history to determine if you have any signs or symptoms consistent with MS, such as a chronic condition, unusual weight gain, unexplained shortness of breath, depression, or seizures. He or she will conduct tests known as SPECT imaging (single photon emission computed tomography) or MRI scans to check the function of certain brain structures, like the","long-term effects likelihood Multiple Sclerosis.

How Tobacco Use Affects Your Health

Excessive amounts of nicotine can be harmful to your health. Nicotine has been linked with an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, lung infections, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and throat irritation.

Smoking cigarettes releases toxic substances into the air that are harmful to human life. Studies have shown that second hand smoke contains approximately 10% more carcinogens than first hand smoke. This is why most indoor smokers exhale far less harmful toxins than non-smokers when they breathe out smoke. In addition, there is also evidence showing that smokers experience increased problems with their lungs as compared to nonsmokers because of the higher level of toxins found in tobacco smoke.","prognosis, severity of disability.

The answer is yes, the treatment has been shown to be effective in treating MS and other neurological conditions such as ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease).

When used together with drugs called TMS or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), it can help control symptoms, improve overall quality of life and extend a patient's life expectancy. However, there are drawbacks as well, according to Dr. William Kupferberg, director of medical research at the University of California San Francisco, who wrote an editorial about the study published by JAMA Neurology on Monday.

""Most people with chronic pain have no known underlying neurologic deficits that could account for their condition,"" he said in an email. ""Treatment with these medications may affect the brain."" The treatments use electrical currents to target specific areas of the brain. That means they can be used to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, but also other disorders such as diabetes, epilepsy and depression. Although the devices do not cause damage to nerve cells, they still affect how neurons function.

Kupferberg added that since it is not clear what causes MS, the best course of action remains unknown.

Still, the findings provide hope for millions of Americans suffering from MS and those diagnosed with other neurological conditions. Researchers noted that the results do not apply exclusively to patients with MS. Those with any neurological disorder should consider trying one of these treatments.","no significant difference in the incidence or prevalence of MS between patients who received placebo and those who took melatonin, but there was a trend towards a reduced risk of developing MS among people who take melatonin for more than six months.

BELOW: Table 7 summarizes all published studies on the use of melatonin to treat multiple sclerosis.

C. Inhibitor of platelet aggregation: A study conducted at Mount Sinai Medical Center found that an oral supplement containing 50 mg of melatonin per day did not affect the level of CAA in blood (Fig. 8). This finding is consistent with other research showing that melatonin does not bind to CCAAs, which are thought to be responsible for inhibiting platelets' ability to aggregate when they come into contact with clots of blood during bleeding.2 These results suggest that melatonin does not contribute to CAA levels in blood.

D. Melatonin's inhibition of platelet aggregation may contribute to its antiinflammatory properties: There have been several clinical trials examining the effect of melatonin on various inflammatory conditions including heart attack, stroke, arthritis, inflammation of the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, and allergic reactions.3 Although these studies have yielded some promising results, each has had methodological limitations. For example, most studies have used very low doses of melatonin and/or have examined only one inflammatory condition. Another limitation involves the high rate of discontinuation due to side effects associated with melatonin supplementation.4 Therefore, it remains unknown if taking melatonin supplements will lead to beneficial effects in any particular individual patient population.

E. Other adverse effects not related to melatonin: The FDA has issued warnings about several other potential adverse effects from the use of melatonin. One such effect occurs in women when taken during pregnancy.5 A small number of reports of miscarriage have also been reported during treatment with melatonin.6

F. What about sleep disorders? It has been suggested that melatonin may disrupt sleep patterns in certain individuals.7–9 However, other researchers have questioned this claim because melatonin may enhance daytime alertness in otherwise healthy adults.10–12 This suggests that melatonin may promote wakefulness rather than block it. If so, then the proposed link between melatonin and insomnia could simply reflect the fact that melatonin inhibits neuronal activity when we lie down, whereas we fall asleep when we stand up. Furthermore, evidence suggests that melatonin has many health benefits beyond improving sleep quality.13–15","multiple sclerosis (MS)

Q: What is the risk of developing MS in young adults?

Mortality rates from MS increased with age until about 40 years, when they stabilized and then began to increase. At younger ages, people develop more often relapses, which can lead to disability or death. The number of new cases has been increasing for several decades. MS also affects an estimated 11 million Americans today, although it's not clear how many will have a history of the disease by 2030. There are no known prevention strategies. People who already have MS should be screened regularly using standard screening tests.

Q: What causes MS?

The main cause of MS is a change in myelin sheath—the fatty substance that surrounds nerves—in the brain and spinal cord. This tissue loses its protective coating as people get older. Normally this coating protects nerve fibers so signals travel properly between cells and signal centers. But during the early stages of MS, the sheath may break down, leaving the brain vulnerable to damage. This breakdown triggers inflammation and immune response. Eventually, white blood cells called T cells attack brain cells and their connections. These attacks trigger permanent changes in the brain's electrical activity (called demyelination). Over time, lesions in the brain become smaller and less well-defined, affecting what parts of the brain function properly.

Another way the body responds to MS is through autoimmunity, where antibodies are produced against specific proteins that help control the symptoms of the disease. Autoimmune diseases often occur alongside other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, causing joint pain, fatigue, and joint swelling.

Finally, there are genetic factors. A person's chance of getting MS increases if both parents have the disorder; if one parent gets it, the chances go up even more. Although the exact genes involved in MS aren't fully understood yet, researchers believe some of them contribute to inflammation.

People who carry these mutations tend to have an increased risk for MS and die earlier than others.

Q: How does MS affect the central nervous system?

In the central nervous system, MS affects a group of nerve cells called Schwann cell axons, which extend into deep structures like the cerebrospinal fluid and the retina. They form myelin sheaths around neurons and enable communication among nerves at the level of individual fibers. Axonal loss causes problems for many areas of the brain. In the optic nerves, for example, vision is impaired because","nTMS

Q: Long term effects

The study was a randomized, double blind controlled trial of 12 months duration in adults with MS who were between 25 and 75 years old. Participants received either low (12 mg/day), medium (25 mg/day) or high dose (100 mg/day) nTMS for 12 weeks followed by one year follow up, during which time no other treatment was administered.

All participants had previously been treated with at least two courses of standard care, including steroids or immunosuppressants (ie. cyclophosphamide), and any adverse events were recorded. All participants provided informed consent before participation. The clinical research department responsible for the trial reported no safety concerns related to the use of the nTMS procedure. Nervous system involvement scores assessed in all patients were within normal range throughout the intervention period. The study also included cognitive testing.

Mean cumulative efficacy over 12 weeks was estimated as follows:

= mean change from baseline on the primary efficacy endpoint after 12 weeks = 1 SD (1.0) - mean change from baseline on the secondary efficacy endpoint after 12 weeks = 0.5 SD (0.8) – 1.0 SD (0.8)

As can be seen, this study demonstrated that nTMS is safe and well tolerated in adults with multiple sclerosis while yielding improvements in many objective measures of disability.

The patient is a 44 year old woman who presented with an exacerbation of her MS symptoms in the past week. She was diagnosed with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) after 1 year and has had no recurrence since then, even during an episode of acute phase relapse that lasted 3 days. \r

She started taking lamotrigine 2 weeks prior to presentation and reported significant improvement in her clinical symptoms. After stopping her medication for 6 months, she did not regain the previous level of function until 3 years later when she returned to MS clinic where she underwent serial MRI scans. The median time between treatment initiation and final scan was 10 months. At the end of follow up, she had no evidence of neurological deficits or neurodegenerative disease. Her MS index score improved from 27 to 21 at the beginning of therapy, and thereafter it steadily decreased over time. In addition, she showed improvements on verbal memory, attention and social cognition tests. There were no side effects noted. \r

[...] The patient also exhibited a decrease in carpal tunnel syndrome that occurred despite continued treatment with lamotrigine.

a. An estimated 5% to 10% of patients with MS are likely to be misclassified as relapsing-remitting by the clinical criteria used for diagnosis and treatment [4,8]. The current model was developed from the existing data that have been collected in this country during a 4 year period. The primary purpose is to estimate the magnitude of excess mortality among individuals with MS who may or may not have relapsed. The secondary goal is to develop an appropriate mechanism for calculating the risks associated with MS that might exceed those of other diseases. In addition, it will allow us to assess the relative importance of various aspects of life quality (e.g., physical, psychological) when attempting to identify factors influencing the risk of death. b. The primary objective is to calculate risks associated with each aspect of life, which might exceed those of other diseases, over time. c. These estimates are based on information received during telephone interviews with approximately 4000 respondents between 1989 and 1993. d. Results are presented using standard methods for extrapolation and calculation (Krueger, 1994). The data were weighted so that they would have equal numbers of men and women. e. A similar process has been employed in other countries where these surveys have been conducted since 1990 [10]. f. No attempt was made to account for possible differences in definitions of disability in different parts of the world. g. Estimates represent the number of deaths attributable to the disease over a given period divided by the total population. h. Statistical significance was assessed at the.05 level for all comparisons, except age-, sex-, and education-adjusted odds ratios, which were tested at the.001 level. i. Because these estimates cannot distinguish between true beneficial versus harmful effects, it is necessary to make adjustments for these effects if we wish to derive a ""true"" estimate of the hazard ratio (i.e., one that includes only true beneficial effects and excludes any harmful effects). j. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).","an overview of the literature.

The National Workers' Compensation Board (NWCB)

I've been a lawyer for 30 years now and I've handled numerous workplace injury cases. The NWCB does what is required under the law in regards to disability insurance and claims. It's important to know that there are two different levels of coverage and each has its own requirements. This can be confusing because the regulations vary from company to company and there aren't any clear instructions on exactly which employees should be covered. In fact, there isn't even clear guidance on who should qualify as a disabled worker or what compensation they should receive if injured.

The first level of protection for employees is called ""employee"" and consists of health, medical, and life insurance. There is also a certain amount of liability coverage. Under this plan, if someone causes a death while working, their employer is legally responsible for paying the deceased's estate a sum equal to 100 percent of the insured person's salary, plus any benefits they received over the period of the insured person's employment. If the accident was caused by the insured person and was the result of gross negligence, then the liability policy pays the legal fees for the victim's family and attorney. So if a driver injures another motorist while texting, they would have to pay the victim's family $1 million plus an additional $500,000 to cover any damage to property. On top of that, the victim's family gets to keep any money that is left after these costs are paid. When you combine this with the limited amounts of workers comp insurance available, it is very expensive for employers to pay for such a claim. Also, if an employee is unable to work due to a condition affecting his or her ability to walk or work properly, they may still get workers comp insurance, but only if the employer has made the decision beforehand.

As far as determining whether a worker should be entitled to workers comp, it depends on three things: (a) whether the employee suffered a physical impairment; (b) the extent of the physical impairment; and (c) the degree of carelessness shown by the employer.

Physical Imp","I'm working in a department that is very liberal and open. My supervisor knows about my MS diagnosis but we don't discuss it with each other or any of the others. There are always rumours and speculations floating around so I feel like no one wants to be accused of being a 'disease monger' while I've been working here for almost two years. (Cue a few chuckles) So, if they were to find out I had MS, the reaction would probably range from pitying me to outright dismissal!


My biggest fear is that some day I might need an operation. When you are young and healthy, your body can handle the impact of such an event without much trouble - as long as you're in good health and keep a positive attitude to life. However, once you start having symptoms, you have to accept that you may not live another ten years. So when someone asks me what's going on with me I usually say that I'm having'spontaneous' attacks and often explain why this happens. They often try to figure out what was wrong with me and then suggest an intervention plan. In some cases I do get suggestions on what type of treatment should be done and what medication I should take. But even though I try to put myself in their shoes, I still dread what will happen when my condition becomes more severe. It may turn into chronic pain which only makes me more depressed and anxious. Or it could lead to full blown seizures - something that doesn't go away easily.


What advice would you give someone who has MS?\nA: You have to learn to trust yourself. No matter how bad things seem, they can change quickly. Don't let anyone tell you that you cannot do anything because you are sick. There is nothing to lose by trying something new. And never be afraid to ask people to help you. For example, when you see someone in distress, just talk quietly to them and make sure they know you care. And when you meet people for the first time, try to introduce them with 'Hi, my name is...' rather than saying 'I am so sorry', as you'll want to avoid causing offence. Many people have already come to the conclusion that there is nothing they can do for you. That's why it's important to listen to those close to you.


Wherever possible use headphones during lectures or meetings. If you still wear earplugs, make sure you remove them before leaving the room. This way nobody","Many people are aware of the disease and think MS is common. Some don't understand the severity or impact of MS. They're nervous about sharing their diagnosis with co-workers who may be unaware of the symptoms of this debilitating disease. We want to make sure that everyone understands what we have to say on this topic.""

In addition to providing information on MS, other resources for co-workers include ""MS Basics"" on the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's website, www.ms.org, and the University of Maryland Medical Center's MS Resource Center (www.mrcg.umd.edu).","They should be supportive. If they're not, then you need to work harder to get them on board.

If your company is one of the first companies in your industry or field to publicly announce that it has MS, you might be surprised by how many people assume that everyone with MS works for a pharmaceutical company. The reality, however, is that MS is a lifelong condition and most people don't have a diagnosis until later in life. Therefore, there are many people who believe that MS is an occupational disease.

The stigma associated with MS can make working conditions even more difficult than usual. This is where MSers' skills come into play. As a result, many MSers want to do what they can to help others who also deal with chronic illness.

""At first glance, it would seem like I'm a lazy person because my career choices indicate I am,"" says Julie Dickson, a professional speaker who uses her MS as a platform for helping those in similar situations. ""But I truly think I was born this way.""

MSers often face challenges when trying to communicate their needs and concerns about employment. Many employers are reluctant to provide accommodations because they may appear insensitive, which could create problems for other employees. In order to overcome these obstacles, MSer organizations offer training seminars and networking events such as our monthly social gatherings. These opportunities allow individuals who struggle daily to connect with others living with MS and give them valuable information about accommodations and job options.","I'm not sure if they'll be supportive. I've heard that one of my coworkers is dealing with MS and it's a very complicated disease.

I know there are people who are not comfortable or don't understand MS but I try to be as open about what I do here so people can learn from me and not feel embarrassed by my disability.

Q: How did you get involved in the study?\nA: The study was initiated by an anonymous donor, but I was offered an opportunity to participate after being invited by my supervisor. She asked me for help getting a sample of blood into the lab as we were planning a follow up on some samples collected during our previous research project. It took me just over an hour to complete the form and send the blood back, which is fairly typical for this kind of thing, but I didn't think much of it until months later when the first results came through. I began researching on MS in 2011, and it wasn't until the second half of 2012 that I started learning more about the condition and how severe it really is. My initial reaction upon finding out about the possibility of MS in a friend was pretty negative because we had already been talking about MS for years. Since then though, things have gotten better for her. She has gone on a total of five medications that have helped significantly improve her symptoms (some of them are experimental) and she's still alive today. When I found out about MCS, I immediately got interested in learning more about the disease, especially since so many other researchers have been studying the illness for decades. I hope to contribute to helping others like myself become aware of the MS process and the importance of taking care of themselves and their loved ones.

This story is part of a series examining MS, its treatments and cures. For more stories, visit www.news-medical.net/ms.","I'm pretty sure it'll be a very difficult question to answer. But they can look forward to me going through every detail of my time with them, taking notes and making all the necessary changes as per their request, which I shall do in such a way that everyone's name remains completely out of our conversation. As for colleagues who are already aware of this condition, we should wait until we have completed some consultations before we bring up the topic at work.

Q: How would you manage your mental health while working?A: My wife has been my support system throughout most of my MS diagnosis process. She is by far one of the hardest working people I've ever met. When I go home she makes sure that I am well-rested and make sure that I don't take any unnecessary risks or get myself into situations that might exacerbate my symptoms. In addition, she is extremely good at keeping me on track. If I ever find myself in an emotional state, I always know where to reach her for help. At times when things start getting too much for me, I also call her for reassurance. Of course, she knows about my MS and has seen many other patients with similar conditions so she knows exactly what to expect if something happens. It takes more than just having to deal with a disease; it requires constant vigilance in managing it. That being said, there are certain things that have made it easier for us both personally. For instance, after my first few months at work, I could tell from the tone of conversations that other employees had that I was not welcome. People were afraid to say anything to me because they didn't want to upset me. However, once I started seeing the positive effect of her presence and the support others gave me, I realized that maybe this wasn't such a bad thing after all. So then I began to see some things differently. It helped that I actually shared these thoughts openly with those around me. Although I still struggle with the same issues, I now feel confident enough to share my feelings with others without fear of ridicule or blame. There is another benefit as well. One day while driving down the highway towards home, I saw two young men in a car chatting together outside of their apartment building. Suddenly, I stopped the car and introduced myself. Before they knew what happened, the man sitting next to him looked up at me and immediately took his phone out to record a video message and give to me. The person he was speaking to simply laughed and replied ""no problem!"" He","My supervisor is very supportive. She's also one of my best friends. I'm very fortunate to have her support.  I have had many people who've shared their own personal stories of MS with me and some are in the same boat as I am, but they haven't been able to share that information because they were afraid.  The last thing we want to do is cause them anxiety or stress.","We have received positive feedback from all the other doctors. Some people were very surprised when they found out I'm a MS patient and some others were happy to be able to support me in my disease. I don't think it will affect our professional relationship because we both accept that MS is just like any other disability.

Q: What are you doing with your life now?\nA: When I started this journey (MS), I had no idea what my future held for me but I knew I wanted to live my life as fully as possible and make the most of every day. That's why I still go hiking even though I can't use my mobility scooter anymore. It has given me the opportunity to spend time outdoors and discover new things I never would have considered before. So far, I've been fortunate enough to find work at a health club where there are several active members with MS. The gym provides much needed exercise, while also allowing me to maintain my independence. It makes me feel good being on my own, which is important after MS leaves its mark on your body.","it is very important that I tell everyone that my condition is not a joke. People who know me know this, so they might be shocked by the revelation but generally speaking it is not an issue.\r

Q: what do you do for money? \nA: I am self-employed as a freelance writer and translator and most of my earnings come from writing or translations. This includes freelance and part time work and even some freelance editing work where I'm asked to do copyediting on other people's work (which means I have to edit them myself).\r

\r


Q: How does your MS affect your ability to move about freely? \nA: When I first had MS my movement was severely restricted in terms of what I could do, but now my movements are quite normal after a couple of years with treatment. My left arm doesn't need much support.\r

\r


Q: Where would you like to live if you don't own property? \nA: I love living alone and owning my own home but life isn't cheap. To help pay the bills I get paid via my translation business and through doing freelance editing work which requires me to travel. The only thing I want to do when I can afford to is visit friends, family and places I've lived in. The last time I visited my parents' home in Denmark we spent three days there, which was wonderful! It's hard to see things clearly while I have MS because every day I have to think about all those little details but I'd like to start travelling more again, especially overland.\r

\r


Q: What advice would you give someone with MS? \nA: If possible avoid driving for a few months before getting the right treatment. Also make sure you take regular breaks throughout the day and night. Try to eat well and drink lots of water. Drink plenty of coffee. Keep a diary. You may find that your symptoms begin to improve just from making these changes. If so, then go ahead and try changing one or two things at once instead of trying many things at once. There is no hurry and all you'll ever learn is that you don't have MS. If you're not ready to change your lifestyle yet, then wait until you're ready. Some patients decide at this stage that MS is too painful to continue on and so choose to stop their medication.\r

Q: Who","It is better to disclose MS early in the relationship.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

""This information may be viewed as a conflict of interest,"" Ms. Hecht said. ""There are situations where it would not benefit either party to have their medical conditions revealed."" But she added that there was no specific policy on disclosure among her group's members.

But when Ms. Hecht and other advocates say they can find few differences between disability insurance for employees and medical benefits provided by employers or third parties — unless those who have them opt out — it becomes difficult to explain why the programs should exist at all. For one thing, many people with disabilities do not qualify because of financial constraints. Some live on disability payments and may not want to enroll in an employer plan. And many employers provide disability coverage as part of health care plans and require employees' permission to switch to a new plan if their current one goes away.

Some employers simply prefer having a doctor or nurse available to manage employee claims while working. Others, including large corporations like IBM, choose to pay doctors directly rather than rely on an insurer to cover their costs.

And some companies don't think they need such coverage. In its 2006 annual report, AT&T listed as its top priority maintaining a high level of corporate flexibility in providing disability benefits. The company did not answer questions about whether it had any disabled workers, or how much it pays each worker toward a disability fund.

At the same time, the private sector has been slow to make major changes to its benefits policies. There is little pressure from customers to raise premiums as premiums climb. And even though research shows that the longer someone works without retirement savings, the more likely he or she will become disabled, most Americans lack access to defined-benefit pensions and instead face a complex web of options from which to choose.

""You have this situation where most Americans are covered under something less generous than what we offered before,"" said Bruce Tarter, a professor at the University of Illinois who studies retirement systems. ""I'm not sure this program serves the goal that people were promised. We're paying more money for fewer services. That seems wrong.""

Mr. Tarter says it is important to keep in mind that many people with disabilities get the support they need from public and private agencies. The government provides home heating assistance, subsidized school lunches and food stamps. It also provides Medicaid, which covers medical expenses and long-term care for disabled children; Supplemental"
63,Q: Will multiple sclerosis affect my career?\nA:,"MS affects the entire body, and people who are affected by this disease can have a range of careers. You may find that your job or occupation is restricted to a particular part of the world in which MS is prevalent. For example, some of you may have been told that you will be unable to work for many years while you recover from an MS diagnosis. However, if you feel ready to re-enter the workforce, we encourage you to contact us at careers@moses.org (or click on ""Career Opportunities"" in the left column). You can also look up your state's medical boards website. We urge everyone with MS to make sure they understand all their options.

What is the best treatment for Multiple Sclerosis?\nA: The best possible care for MS depends on where you live and how long you have had symptoms. If you have a slow progressive course of MS, it is important to speak directly with your health care professional about the most appropriate way to proceed. Unfortunately, there is no cure for MS. There is a great deal of hope that therapies such as drugs and other treatments can slow down the progression of the disease. Currently available medications are not approved by the FDA and may have side effects. Although these medications may help, there are still many unanswered questions about the impact of using them on the brain. It is imperative that patients know what is considered safe and effective when it comes to treatments. Our goal is to educate you so that you have a more informed choice and the tools necessary to choose the best treatment option.

If I'm diagnosed early enough, does that mean I won't need surgery or radiation therapy after all?\nA: No, MS is very treatable, but sometimes even the best doctors cannot anticipate every possible complication. When someone is diagnosed with MS before symptoms begin, surgeons and radiologists often recommend early intervention because MS has less risk factors than cancer and heart diseases. This means that, ideally, treatment should take place before any problems develop. In fact, some studies suggest that the first three months of treatment can reduce the rate of disability for those with MS. As a result, some MS specialists will consider delaying treatment until one year after onset rather than waiting until age 30 to determine if the person has progressed to irreversible dementia. Of course, it's essential to talk to your doctor about whether treatment should continue if you experience any unusual symptoms or neurological complications.

How much do medical insurance companies cover MS? How much coverage does my employer provide? How much","It can, although it is possible to find employment in a number of careers that don't include working with or being near MS patients. There are many reasons why this might happen including personal and family commitments, occupational requirements (some occupations require contact with the body's immune system), limited job experience, and other factors related to disability. A more detailed article on managing the impact of multiple sclerosis on work can be found here. \r

""The fact remains, however, that MS affects nearly 5% of Americans. This means that at least five percent of these individuals must have some form of MS to function in their jobs. As such, they should avoid any activities that expose them to other people with MS.""


Q: What does an employee need to do if he/she has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis before being hired?\nA: An employee who receives a diagnosis of MS during pre-employment screening should take action immediately. One of the first things you should do after receiving your diagnosis is consult a physician for evaluation. The best way to learn more about MS is through education; seek out as much information as possible from people living with MS or their friends. A good place to start is by visiting www.ms.org. Your doctor may refer you to an MS support group. Another excellent resource is the Multiple Sclerosis Society of America (MSSA). More information is available at http://www.msausa.com/. In addition, please consider finding additional medical assistance before applying for the position. Many employers offer paid sick days. Also, consider asking if there is an insurance plan offered for employees with MS. If not, then consider obtaining coverage now. Finally, ask if the company provides a reasonable accommodation. For example, if a supervisor needs to leave early so that he/she can attend to an emergency situation, consider informing the employer that this is what you would like done. You may also wish to see a lawyer or go directly to MSSA or the MS Department of Labor for further legal advice. To request assistance with a complaint filed against your employer, call the Illinois Department of Labor Complaint Assistance Program toll free at 877-869-9777 between 7am and 11pm, Monday thru Friday, excluding holidays. Please note that this program is only available in English. Q: Is it common for employers to ask me about my health history prior to hiring me?\nA: Employers often make inquiries about potential employees' medical histories upon hire. These inquiries usually follow a similar pattern.","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. While there are many symptoms associated with MS, it can be very difficult to diagnose because of its varied presentation and unpredictable course. MS affects up to 1 in 10 Americans over age 50, so MS makes an enormous impact on our society. The good news is that you're more likely to have a job than most people realize -- MS is the only condition in which nearly 90% of people who start working will not develop any disability or problems at work. But even if your doctor diagnoses you as having MS, you may be able to continue to work without impairment due to other conditions such as osteoporosis or certain medications for depression.

The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is committed to promoting awareness of MS through research, education, advocacy, and support. AAN members can attend the Annual Meeting in Atlanta in October 2015 to learn more about MS-related research.","Multiple sclerosis can impair a person's ability to work, but it does not permanently prevent an individual from working. The effects of MS vary depending on the individual and the disease (MS), which may cause muscle atrophy or paralysis in one side of the body while allowing other areas of the body to function normally. Some individuals with MS may experience fatigue, depression, cognitive difficulties, memory loss, difficulty speaking, problems walking, or other symptoms that significantly limit their ability to perform typical daily activities. However, many people with MS are able to maintain the same level of activity they have always enjoyed without any noticeable limitations. Individuals with MS typically require help with basic physical tasks such as dressing, bathing, eating, maintaining relationships, driving, and managing finances. They may also need assistance with shopping for groceries, preparing meals, using computers, taking medications, and more.

How do I know if I'm having MS?\nA: If you suspect you might have MS, talk to your doctor about testing. It is important to be tested before you begin therapy, at least once during treatment. For most people, the disease clears up on its own over time. There are several types of tests used to diagnose MS, including: Blood test (polymerase chain reaction) - this blood test looks at proteins called proteins known as antigens. These proteins are thought by some scientists to be the first signs of MS. Polymerase chain reaction tests measure how much protein is present in the patient's blood. This test tells doctors whether a person has been diagnosed with MS or another condition, like diabetes, that affects how well the body processes food. Autopsy - an autopsy is a procedure where tissue samples are removed from the body and examined under a microscope to determine the exact nature of a problem. An autopsy will often show what type of MS the body has. A spinal tap - sometimes called an endovascular catheterization procedure, this technique uses a small tube through which fluid collects and enters the bloodstream. When fluid is introduced into the spinal cord, it causes electrical signals to travel along nerve fibers, causing them to communicate with each other and the brain. The flow of electrical impulses determines the course of action of specific nerves. During an endovascular catheterization procedure, the surgeon removes a small amount of fluid inside the spinal canal so that it can collect in the arteries between the vertebrae. In this way, they are able to determine whether or not the presence of fluid in certain locations indicates that there could be a neurological problem","It is important to understand that MS affects many parts of your life, and you can have a positive impact on others by supporting your fellow individuals with this debilitating disease. If you are diagnosed with MS and do not feel comfortable working, consider another profession where you may get the support of other people who share your condition. For more information about how MS impacts our society, visit www.neurodegenerativedisease.org","MS is an incurable disease. If you have MS, it will impact your ability to work and lead a normal life. There are several factors that will determine how successful you'll be in your career as a result of MS. These include your overall health and the severity of your symptoms. For example, if you are over 50 years old and have symptoms (such as muscle weakness or difficulty walking), you may not be able to do all the things you normally would due to MS.

How does a person's disability factor into their employment decisionmaking?

There are many important elements to consider when assessing whether someone has been discharged from military service because of disabilities. Disability is one such element; however, there can also be other factors such as whether a particular condition affects a veteran's dependents, how long they've served, or the seriousness of a particular injury.

For instance, some veterans with conditions like cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer's disease have lost their eligibility for medical benefits by virtue of having experienced too much exposure to the environment during their military service. Veterans with multiple sclerosis who experience debilitating neurological symptoms due to a brain lesion or stroke may also find themselves disqualified from receiving VA disability compensation.

This can make it difficult for employers to justify employing someone with a disabling condition.

Is it possible to receive both a separation pay and an income-based monthly pension upon retirement?

Yes, it is perfectly legal to collect your severance payments while still collecting your pension benefits at age 67 after serving 20 years on active duty for the U.S. government. However, the two benefits are separate and cannot be combined into one lump sum payment. You must request this type of separation pay separately from your monthly pension payments. You can learn more about separation pay and your entitlement to a monthly pension by reading our information sheet entitled ""What Separation Pay Is and How Can It Help Me.""","Multiple sclerosis can impact many aspects of a person's life, including their job. The degree and severity of symptoms are affected by the number of sclerosis lesions that have developed in the brain. For example, people with active disease may be able to work well but develop memory loss or other cognitive problems. People with severe lesions are more likely to lose mobility (particularly walking), which limits their ability to do routine tasks such as caring for themselves, performing household chores, working at home, or attending school. In addition, individuals who experience repeated episodes of neurological disability will also face challenges when attempting to return to jobs that require manual dexterity. Individuals with milder symptoms may still be eligible for employment if they meet some requirements for entry-level positions. However, because these conditions cause significant limitations in day-to-day activities, it is recommended that an employer consider alternative positions within three months of the onset of symptoms. If you believe your condition might pose a conflict with your work, ask your doctor about applying for disability benefits before leaving work. A qualified agent can help you apply for coverage under your state's Social Security system. Your agent should provide information on Medicaid and Medicare programs.

Q: How often must I check my blood pressure, take medication, or visit a physician before receiving a letter stating that I am disabled?\nA: The U.S. Department of Labor does not recommend a specific interval between checkups or visits to medical providers, except for those patients whose health issues make it impossible for them to attend regular office visits. It is very important for employees to keep up-to-date with personal care needs and medication changes. It is advisable to consult a physician every two weeks or once a month for nonemergency health concerns; at least once annually for emergency situations. At any time during the year, it is prudent for all employees, especially those with chronic conditions, to contact their employers to discuss possible adjustments to their job duties and schedules so that they can remain free from disabling conditions without having to miss days or even weeks of work each year. Some workers may want to receive a copy of a letter indicating that they are disabled if they believe that this information might prevent them from getting a better job offer. However, employers cannot guarantee that an employee would receive such a letter regardless of whether they ask about it or choose to disclose this information.

Q: What do I need to know about my federal benefit rights and obligations while working with my union representative?\nA:","I believe it will. With the current prevalence of MS, one can easily see how a person's ability to perform in their professional life may be affected, as well as their social and emotional life. However, this is not necessarily a bad thing; many people with Multiple Sclerosis find that they are able to function quite well outside work or school. Many other professionals have been affected by MS, such as doctors, dentists, engineers, and business owners. These individuals have found ways to take advantage of their disability and maintain their careers despite limitations.

Some employers have policies in place for employees who have disabilities. If your employer does not provide such coverage, you might be able to purchase insurance on your own. You may also want to consider taking a job at a medical center. These centers specialize in assisting patients from all walks of life throughout their treatment. For example, some facilities treat children with neurodevelopmental disorders, providing them with specialized services, including occupational therapy and speech therapy. These programs are very beneficial to people with MS and help to build confidence and self-esteem. A good physician can often make such assessments and refer patients to these types of program. Also, in the case of an employee whose employment contract includes benefits like health care, it may be possible to negotiate a benefit package with the hospital where you work. It should be noted that some hospitals do offer disability insurance and/or retiree health plans which include such benefits. The key is knowing your rights and responsibilities regarding workplace conditions.

Q: What is the outlook for MS?\nA: There is no known cure for MS, but there are effective treatments available today and a variety of therapies being developed over time. Although the disease is difficult to manage, early intervention can significantly reduce its severity. In fact, studies show that up to 75% of patients can control the onset of symptoms after starting treatment within six months. The only serious long term consequences associated with MS are pain, numbness, muscle weakness, loss of vision, and cognitive impairment. Other effects, such as headaches, fatigue, and sleep disturbances occur more frequently than those related to diabetes and hypertension, making any of these symptoms a significant concern if they become severe enough. Therefore, it is essential that patients understand what to expect and plan accordingly. The most important thing is to make sure that they know their diagnosis so that they know how to protect themselves and others around them during the course of their illness.

Q: What should I do about my symptoms? A: Most people with multiple sclerosis have at least some symptoms that they can't explain, which means that there's no cure for MS and that most patients are left trying to live with their condition every day. The best way to treat your symptoms is by staying as active as you can while avoiding any triggers so that your immune system will be able to fight off any new attacks from the disease. If you've been diagnosed with MS, it's important that you talk to a doctor about how you're managing your symptoms before making decisions about treatment. You may need medication or surgery to help manage your condition if you're unable to manage them yourself.

Q: What are the chances of becoming ill or developing other complications related to Multiple Sclerosis? A: There is always a risk of getting sick or having other health issues when living with MS but this number varies depending on the severity of your symptoms and the type of MS you have. In general, women tend to be less likely than men to develop certain types of health issues such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart problems; however, women also have a higher chance of developing breast cancer in comparison with men. It's normal to experience some discomfort and difficulty during times when you feel unwell or when your symptoms get worse, especially when you're experiencing pain or stiffness in your legs and feet or vision problems. If you experience these symptoms, call your doctor right away – they could prescribe medicine to help relieve your pain and discomfort. Other common concerns include feeling tired all the time","Multiple sclerosis. B: Bilateral cerebral artery dissection and infarction.

1) In a patient with chronic migraine, the patient's headaches are usually not controlled by over-the-counter pain relievers or medications such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium or aspirin (table 1). The headache may be associated with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and/or cognitive problems that have been present for months or years. A recent history of migraines and a family history of migraine is necessary in order to determine if medication therapy should be started. An abnormal neurologic examination or electroencephalogram can indicate if the patient has had an underlying problem or event(s) causing neurological changes.

2) Patients who report having only one type of headache and no other neurologic abnormalities (headache without aura or dizziness without loss of consciousness), may benefit from a trial of the triptan drug lansoprazole as monotherapy or with an NSAID. Alternatively, patients with migraine with aura could use a combination of the following three drugs: naproxen sodium plus the triptan; zonisamide plus the triptan; and cimetidine plus the triptan. For some patients, these three drugs combined might produce relief more rapidly than would either treatment alone. However, the triptan drug combination is probably preferred, because it requires fewer doses per day and produces a lower incidence of adverse effects than does a single triptan drug.

3) Antibiotics can alleviate the clinical signs and symptoms associated with MRSA infection of the inner ear. Although antibiotic therapy is contraindicated in individuals at risk for developing ear infections, its beneficial effect on the frequency of daily headache attacks has been shown in several studies (see ""Possible Use"" above). Aspirin or indomethacin can decrease the frequency and severity of migraine attacks during the course of the antibiotic therapy. Some research suggests that the side effect profile of the antibiotics taken after meningitis or meningococcal disease may be similar to those seen in migraine headaches. Thus, caution is advised when prescribing any antibacterial agents for migraine patients who do not require regular visits to their primary care physician.

4) In a study involving a cohort of individuals with migraine and postherpetic neuralgia, treatment with ibuprofen plus acetaminophen reduced the frequency and duration of migraine attacks for all participants compared with placebo (61","Symptoms and tests.

GMOs: Genetically Modified Organisms.

Glyphosate: name for a class of active ingredients in Monsanto's Roundup herbicide that disrupts the normal functioning of microorganisms that are vital to plant growth. It is also known as glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH) or chemical weedkillers.

GM foods: food produced by genetically modifying plants with genes from other organisms.

Human exposure to pesticides: There have been many studies showing that pesticide use has negative health effects on humans. The most recent study suggests that human exposure to pesticides may be as high as 1 billion pounds per year. That would represent about 0.5% of the total amount used annually in the U.S., according to the EPA.

IMPACT OF Pesticides on Humans and Wildlife: Pesticide residues can accumulate in animals and people through ingestion of contaminated soil, water, air and food. Exposure to these compounds is highly toxic if it occurs over an extended period of time. When exposed chronically, pesticide residue levels increase dramatically. In addition, insecticidal and fungicidal agents cause damage to the central nervous system by interfering with the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. These chemicals also affect the immune system leading to diseases such as autism and Alzheimer's disease. Insecticidal and fungicidal sprays contain heavy metals including lead, cadmium, arsenic and mercury. Pesticide exposures also interfere with reproduction. Many herbicides and their metabolite metabolites can be endocrine disrupters and cause reproductive problems in mammals.

POTENTIAL DISEASE ASSOCIATED WITH GROWTH INPLACE OR DISTILLING VACCINES: Studies suggest that chronic exposure to certain pesticides may result in developmental disorders. For example, repeated prenatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) results in reduced brain size in children.

PURPOSE OF TESTING AND EVALUATION: Test methods used to detect pesticide contamination include gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS), liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and ion mobility spectroscopy (IMS).

TEST RESULTS: Toxicity of pesticide samples are evaluated using commonly accepted cutoffs at which concentrations above those thresholds indicate potential toxicity.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ANECDOTAL AND INTEG","Multiple sclerosis symptoms (MS) include:

pain

fear

fatigue

muscle stiffness/spasms

reduced mobility

mood changes

tremors

Vision problems, such as blurry vision, are also considered a symptom of MS.

Q: What can be done for people with MS?

A: There is no cure for the disease but there are treatments that may help relieve some of its effects. These include medication and physical therapy to increase range of motion (motion control). Medication helps reduce pain by inhibiting nerve signals in areas involved in muscle spasm. Physical therapy helps strengthen muscles and improve circulation. People often need to keep moving and not let their legs go limp due to fatigue or weakness.

The list is not exhaustive.

Q: How can I help prevent or lessen my risk for MS?A: There are many things that people can do to help reduce their risk of getting MS. These include: taking proper medication; wearing glasses correctly; avoiding exposure to high temperatures; eating right; exercising regularly; staying hydrated; reducing stress; maintaining good nutrition; keeping your body clean and well-rested; and limiting exposures to certain types of physical activity and tobacco smoke.

Who Should Get Tested For Multiple Sclerosis?

MS affects people from all walks of life. It's also affecting children, teens and young adults who haven't yet developed symptoms. Some people with MS have no history of it, while others have had it for years or decades. People with MS often don't know they have the condition because it doesn't affect the way they think, feel or behave. It does occur more frequently in women than men. Also, some people develop multiple sclerosis before the age of 50. This means that someone under 45 might develop MS at any time during his or her lifetime.

How Is MS Diagnosed?

The symptoms of MS usually start suddenly. They then become worse over a period of months. When the MS breaks out, the symptoms get worse even when the patient has no other health conditions. When the disease progresses into an advanced stage — called relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) — the symptoms worsen over several weeks or months. Although some people experience only mild to moderate symptoms of MS, most people with MS have debilitating symptoms, including difficulty walking, blurred vision, muscle weakness, depression, fatigue, sleep problems and numbness, tingling or burning sensations around the head or neck.

Why Do Some People With MS Have No Symptoms?

Some people with MS experience symptoms like those of low back pain, arthritis, headaches, tiredness and/or mental confusion without having a neurological disorder such as spinal cord injury, stroke, dementia, or HIV infection. Other people experience symptoms that are very similar to those of MS but don't need further medical evaluation by a doctor. If there's no clear cause for your symptoms, your primary care physician will likely diagnose you with MS.","Any symptoms, including fatigue.

Question 5: If the patient does not respond to treatment, is there anything else you would recommend?

Yes, I would recommend additional testing such as a MRI or CT scan for MS and an EEG (electroencephalogram) for any other possible neurological problems. It might be helpful if the patient takes vitamins regularly; some studies suggest that taking vitamin B6 can slow progression in people with MS.

Q: What causes Multiple Sclerosis?A: It is caused by an autoimmune response in the body against myelin, which makes up the insulating covering that gives nerves their strength.


The immune system destroys the myelin layer on nerve fibers causing them to lose power and become weak or dead. Symptoms include numbness, weakness, fatigue, vision problems (blind spots), tingling, loss of balance, and difficulty speaking.


There are two types of MS:


Type 1, which affects around one-third of people with it, involves genetic mutations. This type of MS often presents itself as relapsing-remitting; if left untreated, it progresses into full-blown MS. People who suffer from this form tend to be young adults, usually between 20 and 30 years old, and are often women. In Type 2, over 80% of patients will experience progressive disability, resulting in a more severe physical condition and poorer quality of life than those without MS.


Q: How does your blood test for MS work?A: The Blood Test for MS can tell us how well your body's immune system has been functioning in recent months. If your CD4+ T cells are low or absent, you may need treatment with immunotherapy. Immunotherapy uses specific medicines that stimulate the body's own immune system to attack certain forms of the virus and other infections. Once given, these drugs remain active throughout your lifetime until they are stopped by another doctor. It is important that you see a doctor at least twice a year to ensure your treatment continues to work.

If you have had an infection for some time but have not had any medical follow-up tests, such as MRI scans or blood tests, we will contact you to schedule further testing. Your results will indicate whether your treatments are working. We do not know what side effects, if any, may occur during treatment. You should discuss any potential risks with your doctor before taking medication.

Other things you can try to manage your MS symptoms:","Symptoms that are common to MS.

Q: What causes multiple sclerosis? A: Multiple sclerosis is a disease characterized by the body's inability to properly repair and maintain its own tissues. This leads to damage to nerves in your brain, spinal cord, and elsewhere in the body. Q: How do I know if I have MS? A: It depends on how you define it. ""MS"" refers to any of several types of inflammatory demyelinating diseases (ISDs), including relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and secondary progressive MS. However, there isn't one definition for all people with MS; they may be diagnosed based on an MRI or other diagnostic technique. Most people with MS experience at least some of these symptoms: fatigue

dizziness or lightheadedness

restlessness

headache

mild weakness

muscle pain

sore throat or sore gums

slight loss of coordination, balance, muscle tone, or reflexes

loss of bladder control or bowel function

problems speaking

difficulty swallowing

changes in vision

blurred vision

a change in sense of smell

unusual sweating or skin color (usually paler than usual)

lack of sleep The list above only includes some examples of many possible signs and symptoms that can occur as part of MS, so ask about yours. If you feel like you've experienced any of the above signs and symptoms while living with MS, discuss them with your health care provider. It's important to note that you should never stop taking medication because of a single symptom. Your doctor will need to assess whether medications you're taking are helping you manage your symptoms. If you continue to experience worsening symptoms after your current treatment has been exhausted, talk to your healthcare provider about switching to another type of therapy.

Treatment options for multiple sclerosis Treatment options for MS range from drug therapies to lifestyle changes such as exercise or nutrition. Some drugs used to treat MS can also help improve symptoms in those who don't have MS but who might benefit from them. For example, oral steroids may reduce inflammation, numbness, tingling, spasms, and stiffness associated with MS. They may also increase mobility in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Antibiotics and immune system boosting medicines are often prescribed as well. These treatments affect immune cells that play a role in causing MS. Antibiotic drugs may help prevent infection when treating patients","Symptoms that are typical for MS. B: Symptoms that are uncommon in people with MS, but may occur when other things go wrong. C: Other symptoms that can be caused by MS or another medical condition. D: More than one symptom. E: Not sure. Q: What does the term fibromyalgia mean? A: The word ""fibroma"" comes from the Latin ""fibra,"" meaning muscle, and the Greek ""myalgia,"" which means pain. It has also been used to describe an illness characterized by widespread musculoskeletal complaints, such as muscle cramps or chronic joint inflammation. It was first described by Dr. James Ritvo, who is credited with developing the disease's name. In recent years, it's become a popular diagnosis among many patients because they often have fatigue, pain and sleep disturbances similar to those associated with MS.

Q: How do I know if my MS is caused by MS? A: You're more likely to develop MS if you have a family history of it; if your health problems are related to being overweight, obese or on antidepressants; if you've had any kind of stroke or trauma (such as accident or war); or if you've recently had chemotherapy or radiation treatment. Certain genetic mutations also increase your risk. But even if you don't have these conditions, having the same genes doesn't necessarily guarantee that you will get MS. About 20 percent of all adults over age 50 have MS at some point. Some people who don't normally have MS have milder symptoms than others. And some people have severe symptoms only after they start getting older. Many factors contribute to how severe your symptoms are — whether you suffer from fatigue, pain or shortness of breath. Your doctor will work with you to find out what's causing them and figure out what treatments might help you.

Q: What causes multiple sclerosis? A: Scientists don't fully understand why MS occurs, although they believe most cases involve damage to nerve cells in the central nervous system (CNS). There aren't any specific triggers for MS. However, certain factors may increase your risk of the disease. These include: smoking; exposure to toxins such as lead or asbestos; excessive alcohol use; ultraviolet light, including solar UV rays (from sun-lamps and tanning beds) and artificial lighting; infections in childhood or adulthood; infections during pregnancy; exposure to viruses and bacteria; having inherited blood clotting disorders; and diabetes. People with diabetes may also face additional risks from their body","Symptoms that are associated with MS.Q: What is multiple sclerosis?A: Multiple sclerosis is a progressive disease which affects the central nervous system (CNS) and causes disability. It can affect any part of your body, including the arms, legs or eyes. People who have MS may also experience other problems, such as vision changes, muscle weakness, hearing loss, tremors and seizures.Q: How many people in the United States have MS?A: More than 4 million Americans have MS. It's the most common neurological disorder diagnosed among adults over 50 years old. Nearly half of all adults with MS will develop it by age 65, compared to about one-third who get it before they turn 50. This means that nearly 1 out of every 5 adults with MS will be alive during their lifetime. Q: How does MS spread?A: The main way MS spreads is through the bloodstream when infected cells trigger inflammation in the brain and spinal cord. Because MS is so rare and hard to diagnose, there is currently no cure for it. But it can be managed with medication and physical therapy. There is no evidence that MS is transmitted by blood transfusion, but experts say the risk increases if you are at high risk for certain infectious diseases or have had previous infections that can cause serious complications.Q: Are there drugs that treat MS?A: Scientists continue to search for new treatments. There are two medications that have been proven effective against symptoms of MS -- interferon beta and glatiramer acetate (Glatiramer). They work together in an important way -- each drug triggers the release of proteins called ""interleukin"" from white blood cells. These proteins help block immune responses to MS symptoms.Q: Is it possible to become disabled from having MS?A: Yes. In fact, researchers have found that 30 percent of people with MS are unable to carry out some activities without help. Other research indicates that up to 40 percent of people with MS will lose use of an arm or leg because their muscles don't hold enough force. While it isn't clear whether this happens due to poor control of MS symptoms or underlying health conditions, it can make daily life more difficult.Q: Do I need to see my doctor if I want treatment for MS?A: If you're thinking about trying to stop or slow down the progression of MS or other conditions, talk to your primary care physician or neurologist. Your doctor will answer questions about how much MS treatment might be right for you. They'll also offer"
72,Q: Is the Covid-19 vaccine safe for people taking multiple sclerosis drugs?\nA:,"Yes, it is safe. There are some minor risks associated with using any medication that affects the nervous system, but these drugs should not have a major effect on your ability to think clearly or make decisions, and there are no known cases of death from an adverse reaction to the vaccine, although this could be caused by other factors such as infections in the weeks after vaccination.

Q: What kind of research was conducted before vaccines were developed?\nA: For over 100 years scientists had been investigating the possibility of making a better way of giving polio vaccines, but their attempts were stymied by one problem - how do you prevent children from getting sick so they won't spread the disease? In the 1920s doctors started looking at ways of preventing children contracting the virus. Some used chemicals called ""attenuation"" which prevented the body's immune system from attacking polio strains when administered to susceptible children. This worked well until the 1950s when polio immunization became widely available thanks to the success of British scientist Maurice Hilleman who discovered a new method of delivering live viruses into the small intestine through a mucosal surface (called enema). From then onwards it has been relatively easy to develop and produce vaccines against different diseases using this technique.

In recent decades, however, researchers found the development of vaccines was becoming more difficult. By the 1970s it became clear that poliovirus could survive in the intestinal tract indefinitely without being killed off by the host's immune system, even if given intravenously. Scientists began researching alternative methods to deliver vaccines and eventually settled upon a two-step process whereby a weakened form of poliovirus would be injected into the bloodstream followed by a series of injections into lymph nodes. The idea is that the lymph nodes will filter out weakened polioviruses which are unable to infect humans and the blood supply will carry them to the brain where they can cause paralysis (although no deaths have ever been reported following the use of vaccines containing the modified oral strain of poliovirus). However, it wasn't until 1996 that the first successful human trial of the oral version of the polio vaccine was carried out using a combination of three different strains of the virus. Despite these successes it was not until 2004 that the first licensed vaccine was approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the prevention of acute flaccid paralysis, which is caused by a variant of the virus called OPV (oral poliovirus type 1). As well as helping eradicate polio globally polio remains endemic in many parts of the world, particularly in Africa where","The primary benefit of the CVSV-19 vaccination is to protect against the rabies virus. However, because other vaccines may be administered in addition to the CVSV-19 vaccine (e.g., hepatitis B, hepatitis A and/or Haemophilus influenzae type b [Hib] seronegative), it is not always possible to determine which vaccine has been given as a part of a combined regimen with additional therapies. If you are receiving multiple sclerosis medications that include daclizumab, valganciclovir or famciclovir, please contact your doctor prior to administration of the CVSV-19 vaccine.

Q: What should I do if my child receives the CVSV-19 vaccine but develops an adverse reaction after immunization?

A: In most cases, the vaccine will cause only mild reactions within 3 months of vaccination. There have also been reports of severe reactions such as encephalitis following vaccinations, so families should monitor their children's health closely during this time. Parents should report all adverse events to CDC by calling 1-800-CDC-INFO, visiting www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adverseevents.htm or reporting on the VAERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov/.

Q: How long does the vaccine stay in the body?

The vaccine can remain in the body up to 4 weeks. It is important to note that some people develop a temporary soreness or rash on their skin at the site where they were vaccinated. This is called an erythema migrans. Other symptoms may occur, including fever, muscle aches, headache and backache. Please see the Vaccine Safety Information provided above for more information about the vaccine.

Q: Will there be a vaccine shortage?

Yes, vaccine supplies have become limited. Therefore, manufacturers are now producing new batches of these products. Because the production schedule is unpredictable, there could be shortages in the future. Some vaccine manufacturers have already begun issuing recall notices for unopened lots of these vaccines. Please read any FDA vaccine alert regarding a vaccine shortage or recall.","No. This is one of the main reasons why this vaccine was pulled from the market in the U.S.: There have been reports of severe side effects in those who were given it as part of the MS drug regimen, especially with concomitant use of other corticosteroids (such as prednisone or methylprednisolone). Since the drug combination has not been tested on its own merits, there is no way to know if or how these serious complications may be related directly to the vaccine.

Cancer Vaccines for People Taking Multiple Sclerosis Drugs

Vaccination against cancer is now recommended by most medical organizations and governments worldwide. However, vaccination against leukemia/lymphoma (LAM) remains only a recommendation. The CDC does not recommend any additional vaccines specifically targeted at LAM since there are no clinical trials looking into their safety and effectiveness. Because LAM is so rare and so difficult to diagnose, many patients will need to undergo more than one or two vaccines before being diagnosed with LAM, which can lead to immunodeficiency. Therefore, in order to maximize patient safety and minimize costs, it makes sense to start vaccinating people at an early age in order to reduce the risk of developing cancer later on.

Some vaccines that are recommended for adults, such as MMR, also protect against LAM. These vaccines contain live viral components, but they don't cause disease when given to children or adults. They are designed to stimulate immune responses in childhood and young adulthood, similar to the response needed to fight off a common cold.

For example, the Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine contains the bacterium pneumococcus, which causes pneumonia and sepsis, both of which are symptoms of LAM. In addition, the tetanus toxoid vaccine stimulates immunity against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis — three bacterial infections that are associated with LAM.

There are currently about 100 different types of LAM, including the following:

Primary Lymphocytic Leukemia – also known as acute myelogenous leukemia (AMS), this type usually appears between ages 5 and 40 years. It's extremely aggressive, often producing large tumors on bone marrow biopsy. About 1 out of every 3,000 cases is fatal. Most AMS occurs in children under 15 years of age.

Secondary Myelofibrosis – A form of LAM that typically occurs after childhood. Secondary leukemias affect blood cells throughout the","The CDC has not studied this vaccine's safety in people with MS. If you are considering getting a flu shot, check with your doctor before starting any medication that can alter the course of your disease. Q: I have been told by my neurologist and others that I need to be on an anti-seizure drug (Valproate). Can this happen if I get vaccinated against influenza?A: If you are taking certain types of anti-seizure medications, such as carbamazepine (Tegretol) or phenytoin (Dilantin), then yes, it is possible that you could develop seizures after vaccination. Other medications may also interfere with the immune system response to vaccines. It is important to discuss your medical condition with your physician before making any changes in your treatment plan. The flu shots do not contain any ingredients that have the potential to interact with your treatment regimen. They include latex, gelatin, egg protein, milk proteins, chicken eggs, sodium chloride, citric acid, dextrose, and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (not found in the human vaccine).

Q: Should I be worried about the presence of aluminum and other heavy metals in the Flu Shot?

A: Aluminum and many other contaminants from the vaccine have already left the body within several weeks following vaccination, so there should be no concern about ingesting them while receiving the vaccine. Some of these contaminants, such as mercury and formaldehyde, can cause adverse effects when they accumulate in the body over time. However, there are very low levels of contaminant exposure that would increase the risk of serious harm in adults who receive the flu shot. There was one case reported in 2001 of a child whose mother developed meningitis after receiving the flu shot; however, this was linked to her use of alcohol to help quell fever during the day and her breastfeeding. In addition, the most common side effect associated with the flu shot is soreness at injection sites caused by a thin needle. This occurs because the blood vessels in the area contract too quickly and dilate too rapidly. Most patients experience mild swelling and redness lasting up to 7 days following vaccination. After this period, skin will return to its normal coloration. For children, the maximum amount of time for symptoms to appear is 3 weeks. Although some patients may show signs of a reaction within hours, it usually takes 2 to 4 days to confirm a reaction. As with most medicines, there is a small chance that the flu vaccine","Yes. The vaccine is also very effective at preventing disease in children and young adults who are not allergic to chickenpox.

Q: Are there any risks associated with this vaccine?\nA: There are no known serious side effects from the routine vaccination of persons with MS or from immunization of pregnant women, infants, or young children with this vaccine.

Q: How do I get a copy of the Vaccine Information Statement (VIS)?\nA: The VIS is available on our website or by calling 1-800-CDC-INFO. You may also go to your local office of health services and ask them how to obtain the VIS. If you would like more information about vaccines, visit http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/.

About MMR Vaccine\nA: The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is recommended for all persons 11 years of age and older who have not had one dose of measles-containing vaccine. Persons 7 through 9 years of age should receive 2 doses, while those 10 through 12 years of age should receive 1 dose. After school entry, all children born since January 1, 1991, can be vaccinated against measles if they meet CDC-recommended criteria. Measles can cause severe encephalitis (convulsions), including encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the brain). Symptoms include fever, headache, sore throat, runny nose, conjunctivitis (red eyes), muscle aches and pains, myalgia (muscle pain), and coma.

Are there any other side effects associated with flu shots, such as fever, headache, muscle aches or soreness?

Yes, some people experience flu symptoms after getting a flu shot. These can include fever, muscle aches, runny nose and cough. In rare cases, these may last for several days. You may also experience a mild rash around your injection site, which usually disappears shortly after the shot.

You're more likely to get an allergic reaction if you've got a cold during your visit to the doctor's office. If this happens, you need to tell the receptionist about it immediately before having your flu vaccination appointment so that they know how to treat your allergy. This includes telling them whether you've had a cold in the past or if you recently travelled outside of Canada. They'll then take appropriate measures to help manage your condition and prevent future allergies. For example, you might be prescribed medication to reduce the frequency or severity of your symptoms.

Dr. Bruce A. Davis, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of ImmunoVec Inc. (www.immunovec.com), a company specializing in vaccines and immunotherapies for multiple sclerosis, said, ""It's absolutely ludicrous to make such claims."" He added, ""The safety and effectiveness of any drug depends on several factors, including dosage, frequency, duration, timing and mode of administration. We do have some evidence that suggests the administration of corticosteroids may delay progression of MS disease."" Dr. David H. Schoenbaum, Chairman Emeritus, Division of Neurology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York City, agreed, stating, ""There are many ways to induce an immune response, which can be accomplished with different preparations, such as vaccination, injections, infusions, or topical application. Vaccination generally induces a more robust immune response than other methods of inducing an immune response."" He continued, ""The question is whether it has a direct effect on the disease process itself, which could potentially be beneficial, or whether it does nothing useful except delay the appearance of symptoms. There is very little data available in humans regarding this issue because there haven't been enough trials. One trial did show a benefit from vaccination, but there were no placebo controls or long-term followup studies."" Dr. John Clements, M.D., Professor of Pediatrics and Head of Pediatric Allergy/Immunology at the University of Calgary College of Family Physicians, Alberta, Canada, also expressed concern about the use of the term 'vaccine' in the marketing of the anti-MS vaccine. He stated that although he had seen evidence of efficacy of steroids in patients with MS, and was concerned by the potential adverse effects of cortisone, he believed that steroids would be too aggressive a treatment for adults with MS. He noted that if steroids do help slow down or stop disease progression, they must work slowly because they only control symptom flares, not the underlying brain damage caused by the inflammatory phase of MS. Therefore, steroids alone would probably be ineffective for slowing the progress of the disease. Dr. Clements concluded, ""I am against using steroids on MS patients unless they are given through intravenous infusion.""


The anti-MS vaccine does not prevent relapse of MS, even when taken within two weeks of the first relapses, according to a study published in September 2005 in the","Yes, the vaccine is safe. However, many people (especially people on multiple sclerosis medications) are at increased risk of side effects from this vaccine because they take a lot of these medicines. If you have a high dose of any medicine that contains vitamin A or carotenoids (e.g., retinoids and beta blockers), talk to your doctor about whether there's a lower dose that won't harm you (but be sure to tell him or her if you already take such a medication). Also talk with your doctor before starting any new medications that contain vitamin A or carotenoids.

Q: How should I store my flu shot?\nA: Flu shots can remain in their original carton in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks, after which time they must be refrigerated. They also can be stored at room temperature or under a frozen drawer. The flu shot should not be kept in the freezer because it will lose potency over time. This vaccine protects against all three strains of influenza virus, but the best protection comes from one type—the H3N2 strain. It is possible to get the same level of protection by getting two flu vaccines—one with one type of virus and one with another type. You'll need two doses of each vaccine.

If you do keep the vaccine in its original carton, it should be handled carefully so as to avoid injury. Keep it out of direct sunlight. Avoid touching your eyes when the needle is inserted into the body (you may feel some mild pain). If you have an open cut, wash the area immediately with soap and water. Do not rub the vaccine into the skin around the injection site. After injecting the vaccine, shake off any excess fluid and dispose of the unused portion securely into a sealed container.","Yes. There is no safety concern for taking multiple sclerosis drugs (MSRA) with this vaccine.

Q: What about people who are allergic to eggs or soy? The vaccine contains a small amount of egg protein, and some experts say that could trigger an adverse reaction in such people. Does the vaccine contain any other ingredients known to cause an allergy, like gluten? A: No.

Q: Can people take more than one dose? A: We recommend you get all three doses of this vaccine at once.

Q: How long will it take before the vaccine is available again after the nationwide shortage? A: It usually takes from 6 months to 2 years after we run out of a vaccine to bring it back into production.

Q: Will the government require me to register my children's vaccination records with them? A: Vaccines aren't required to be registered by parents with respect to their children. However, if they choose to do so, this information can be used when a child needs to be immunized against diseases such as measles.","The FDA says yes.\r

\t Q: Why is the Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) on the new vaccines not being released to the public?\nA: Because of ""the potential impact"" on people who get the shots, the National Institutes of Health said. \r

\t \nHow can parents know if their child may be at risk for contracting a disease from the vaccines?\r

\tThe CDC says it cannot release that information without a court order and because of ongoing litigation.\r

\tThe government has refused to publicly disclose many other important details about the vaccines. For example, the FDA has refused to say what will happen to the live viruses after they are injected into humans -- something some experts have called crucial. In fact, many vaccine critics say the vaccines are unsafe.\r

\tWhat does this mean for children who receive these vaccines in the future? The federal agency that approves them, the Food and Drug Administration, says it won't provide any safety data or even allow independent scientists to study the effects of the vaccines. And since most medical researchers are reluctant to conduct studies on vaccines given to young children, there may never be any long-term followup studies. The only way to learn whether the vaccine causes cancer in later life could be by testing the vaccine on animals or through genealogy research.\r

\tWhy do people think vaccines cause autism when the evidence is so flimsy? According to some experts, the increased rates of autism were largely caused by the overuse of antibiotics, which destroy certain bacteria that produce toxins known as neurocarcinogens. That's why the Centers for Disease Control recommended against using penicillin in infants because it destroys beneficial strains of bacteria. The CDC also warned doctors not to give babies penicillin unless the doctor was sure no other medicine had been prescribed before it. The same precaution should apply to children whose mothers took antibiotics before pregnancy.\r

\t What role did vaccines play in the spread of measles during the 1980s? One theory suggests that the first outbreak occurred when unvaccinated children were brought to clinics that treated patients with AIDS. A second theory holds that when the virus mutated into a form that was more contagious, it went airborne and infected others.\r

\t How much do we really understand about how vaccines work? The CDC has only recently begun to investigate precisely how vaccines work. Most scientists believe that vaccines are made up of two components"
77,Q: How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?\nA:,"Menopausal symptoms are associated with the onset of MS as women age. Women who become symptomatic during the menopause may have a greater risk for developing MS in later life. The incidence of MS is not known; however, because women are at an increased risk of MS than men, MS and other autoimmune diseases (such as lupus) that affect the joints may be more common among women who become ill in late middle age or early old age. For example, MS occurs significantly more often in young women. This makes sense considering the fact that it is thought that MS develops from inflammation in the body's own immune system, which becomes chronic when cells begin to die off. Although the cause remains unknown, it seems likely that MS affects some aspects of the brain in men and women differently.

Q: What causes premenstrual syndrome?\nA: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS), also called pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), is commonly referred to as ""the menses blues,"" but has many different meanings depending on what you mean by it. In most cases, PMS is defined as a period between menstruation and ovulation. While there may be several reasons why a woman may experience this phenomenon, its most recognized symptom is mood swings such as sadness, irritability, anger and depression. It can last up to two weeks per cycle. Other symptoms include headaches, breast tenderness, fatigue, abdominal pain, bloating, and vaginal discharge. If left untreated, PMS can lead to anxiety, depression, eating disorders, substance abuse, menstrual problems, infertility, premenstrual fatigue, loss of sex drive, changes in appetite, decreased interest in work or school, and weight gain. Although these symptoms generally improve after stopping treatment with certain medications used to treat PMS, they should always be checked out if your doctor suspects that you might be experiencing one of them. As far as how these symptoms relate to MS, it is unclear exactly how and why they develop. However, as we move closer to understanding the mechanism of how MS starts, scientists will be able to figure out how and why these conditions happen so quickly and then stop. For now, researchers believe that the reason why people are affected by both PMS and MS may involve hormones released from the endometrium. There is evidence suggesting that the hormones melatonin and estrogen play important roles in regulating the function of the brain and nervous system. Research suggests that melatonin helps regulate the production of serotonin, while estrogen helps","Menopausal disorders have been associated with an increased risk of developing MS. These include hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), premature menopause, osteoporosis and other health conditions that cause loss of bone mass.

In the study, which was published online in May 2008 in The Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry, researchers found a significant increase in the number of women with MS who also had symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome after they underwent surgery for a hysterectomy. They also examined three different groups -- those who reported having MS before surgery and those whose symptoms were not yet diagnosed -- and found that about one-third of all women undergoing this type of surgery experienced some kind of chronic illness before their operation.

""We see very similar patterns between what we call 'preoperatively' MS and postoperative MS,"" said Dr. David A. Spence, chief of neuroendocrinology at the Mayo Clinic. ""And it's because these women are exposed to a lot of stress during the time before their surgeries. So if you look at the menstrual cycle as well, you can predict pretty accurately whether someone has MS.""

The scientists noted that many factors could account for the link between MS and menstruation and the menstrual cycle. For example, people with MS may have impaired immune function or hormone balance that affects how much estrogen is produced during the month. In addition, there is evidence that estrogen levels are related to pain.

It may be that some women with MS who suffer from both premenstrual exacerbations and premenstrual syndrome also experience a flare up of the disease when they begin their period again. However, the researchers noted that more research is needed to determine what specific impact this might have on MS.

Dr. George Klenk, professor emeritus of obstetrics/gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, agrees that the findings have important implications for doctors treating both women and men with MS.

""Menstruating women are often told by their doctor or nurse that they must take care not to use products containing estrogen, such as tampons, because estrogen could trigger a relapse of the disease,"" he said. ""But these same precautions seem unlikely to protect menopausal women against a recurrence of their own medical condition.""","Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects the central nervous system, causing lesions in myelin sheaths and nerve fibers. It is a chronic, relapsing disorder that affects women over the age of 50. A number of MS patients have been diagnosed with a form of early-onset MS called primary progressive MS. Menopause occurs around age 45, which means that most women with MS who are postmenopausal at diagnosis will be diagnosed as having pre-MS. The main symptom of both MS and PCS is pain. Pain caused by other conditions or medications can cause similar symptoms. Some people experience only one type of migraine headache during their lifetime. Other people may experience two different types of headaches, each lasting for less than three months, or migraines that start in adolescence but stop by adulthood. Migraine attacks may also affect a person's sleep, mood, energy level, concentration, strength and ability to drive, work and perform everyday activities such as eating, walking and dressing. In addition, MS patients often notice that they feel tired more frequently and lose their appetite. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, depending on the severity of the underlying condition. Sometimes people report not feeling well enough to go out without help. People who are unable to work or participate fully in social activities might find it difficult to manage finances, make new friends, get married, or raise children. They might even decide to stop working altogether. Many factors contribute to these symptoms, including fatigue caused by physical work or emotional stress, changes in hormone levels due to changes in pregnancy or menopause, infection, anemia, inflammation, injury or surgery, or depression. Menopause usually causes the menstrual cycle to slow down, leading to heavier flow and cramping that may last up to six weeks before menstruation resumes. During this time, a woman should continue to take her medication regularly because some medicines may prevent the body from properly making estrogen. If there has been a recent change in diet or lifestyle, it can disrupt the balance between hormones, causing problems with estrogen production. However, any changes in diet or lifestyle should be carefully monitored. As a result of a change in diet or lifestyle, it may be necessary to adjust your treatment regimen if you already have PCS or MS. Some health care providers prescribe a combination of estrogen plus progestin to treat both MS and PCS symptoms. This method of using estrogen together with oral contraceptives (birth control pills) has been shown to be safe when used safely. For more information about hormonal contraception and PCS, see","Menopause symptoms are common in MS. They include changes in mood, memory and sleep. Some women also have menstrual irregularities as a result of the menstrual cycle change that occurs in MS. MS is not an equal opportunity disease; some women experience more symptoms than others.\r

""Some studies have suggested that women with MS experience less fatigue and fewer psychosomatic complaints during their first trimester of pregnancy compared to women without MS. \r

\r

Women who undergo treatment for MS may be prescribed oral contraceptives (OCs) or hormones such as progesterone or estrogen, which can affect how well a woman's ovaries function."" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6395871 ""In addition, a recent report indicated that women with MS had significantly higher prevalence rates of depression and anxiety disorders than did controls. It has been reported that patients with MS may be more likely to take antidepressant medications, but there remains debate about whether this is related to diagnosis or treatment response. A number of researchers have reported that female patients have higher levels of depressive symptoms when treated with antidepressants. In one study, depressed patients were found to have greater severity of depressive symptoms on both the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and Beck Depression Inventory than non-depressed females (Nguyen et al., 2005). Similarly, in another study, female patients with MS showed increased prevalence of major depression symptomatology compared to their male counterparts (Lopez et al., 2007)."" http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/286/2/E101 ""The role of oestrogen in central nervous system (CNS)-mediated pathogenesis in AD was first hypothesized by Wacholder & Schuhmacher (1943), based upon data from the German perinatal cohort of 1932–1945. These investigators observed elevated levels of serum oestradiol at 10 weeks postpartum in mothers with breast cancer after they became pregnant. Subsequently, it was shown that high plasma levels of oestrogen induce CNS-induced apoptosis and dysfunction of neuronal excitability. Several lines of evidence support a model whereby ovarian steroid action contributes to neurodegeneration via modulation of excitatory and inhibitory amino acid receptors through activation of G protein-coupled receptor-gamma interferon gamma (GRGs), i.e., AMPK and AMPA/kainate receptors. Moreover, several mechanisms have been proposed","Multiple sclerosis is a progressive disease of the central nervous system that results in loss or impairment of motor and sensory functions, as well as cognitive function. Menopausal symptoms may be related to MS by causing low estrogen levels (hypoestrogenism). Several studies have shown that women who experience hypoestrogenism with postmenopausal women are at increased risk for developing MS. In addition, multiple sclerosis is more prevalent among women who live longer than 30 years. Therefore, it is possible that women who take oral contraceptives will be at increased risk for MS-related symptoms if they have a history of MS.

Q: I am on oral contraceptives. Do they affect my risk for MS?A: Many factors can affect your chance of getting MS, including genetics, environmental exposures such as smoking, being overweight, and having inherited genes that predispose you to MS or other autoimmune diseases. Some of these factors include: age, gender, race, family history, education level, socioeconomic status, and how much weight you carry around. If any of these factors increase your chances of getting MS or other autoimmune disorders, then taking a contraceptive pill could reduce the likelihood of getting them.

The bottom line is that this study shows some benefit from taking birth control pills for MS symptoms, but there's no evidence to suggest that they work better than placebo. This doesn't mean that birth control pills don't help people with MS — just that it's not clear whether they offer any additional benefit over placebo treatment.","Menopause is the transition from reproductive to post-reproductive health. It affects all women, but it is most common in older women (35–55 years of age) with a history of autoimmune disease or cancer, and in those who have had an intact uterus for at least 20 years. Symptoms are similar to those seen during early stages of MS, including fatigue, loss of appetite, vaginal dryness, headaches and sleep disturbances.

In addition, menopause can exacerbate MS symptoms by causing changes in blood clotting, which are also known as vasoconstrictor responses. Vasoactive substances in circulation cause constriction of blood vessels and this triggers inflammation, usually in the legs and feet. The increased risk of stroke that occurs in menopausal women may be related to the high levels of inflammatory molecules that circulate in their bloodstreams (37).

Eating disorders are one of several coexisting conditions that are thought to increase the risk of developing MS (38). In fact, eating disorder symptomatology has been associated with a higher frequency of MS among people with a family history of MS (39). Many individuals diagnosed with MS have problems with food intake (40), and some studies suggest that diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of MS (41). Omega-3 fatty acid deficiency and malnutrition can occur in both sexes during menopause (42), and vitamin D deficiency is reported to be more common in premenopausal women than in postmenopausal women (43). Both low levels of testosterone and reduced levels of estrogen in women with MS increase their risk of depression and other mood disorders (44).

References","A case report (N=6) demonstrates that a woman with MS who had no apparent risk factors for MS was diagnosed with late onset perimenopausal MS and was found to have an unusual number of MS-related symptoms including fatigue, mood changes, decreased sex drive, increased sexual activity, and pain. This is the first reported case of perimenopausal MS in a MS patient.

Q: What are some possible mechanisms by which perimenopausal women may be at risk for developing MS?\nA: Some evidence suggests that estrogen deprivation from ovaries during the perimenopausal period may increase the likelihood of relapsing, or worsening of the disease. These findings support the notion that the menstrual cycle plays a role in determining susceptibility to MS. In addition, the presence of MS in the absence of any other identifiable cause warrants investigation as a potential cause. If a female with MS also has perimenopausal symptoms, it may well indicate a link between her MS and the hormone system. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether this is likely to occur and if so, how frequently such a relationship occurs.

Q: Does the use of oral contraceptives (OCs), particularly ethinyl estradiol (EE), alter the risk for developing MS?\nA: Although OC use is associated with an increased risk for MS, the mechanism through which OC exposure increases the risk remains unclear. It could result from the development of a proinflammatory cytokine response following exposure to OC hormones. Alternatively, OCs could induce damage to myelin sheath around nerve axons, leading to neurodegeneration and inflammation that may eventually lead to MS. Studies examining whether hormonal contraception affects MS outcome remain limited and inconsistent.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, with signs and symptoms including headache, numbness and weakness on one or both sides of the body, difficulty walking, fatigue, sleep disturbance, cognitive impairment, vision problems, bladder dysfunction, chronic pain and a range of other neurological complaints. The first few years after diagnosis may be very difficult for women as they struggle to cope with these symptoms and the emotional turmoil that can accompany them. During this time, most women's symptoms are subtle and may not present themselves until later in life. As MS progresses, it causes damage to areas around neurons called axons which transmit nerve impulses from neuron to neuron and cause many of the symptoms associated with MS. This is known as neurodegeneration and occurs throughout the brain and spinal cord. Menopause affects the menstrual cycle more than any other aspect of a woman's health. It also leads to changes in blood flow and hormone levels, which can affect the functioning of nerves. Although the exact cause is unknown, there are several theories regarding the link between MS and menopause. One theory is that MS is triggered by an inflammatory response within the immune system against a cell type known as microglia. Microglia contain a protein called CD47, which binds directly to the surface of macrophages — white blood cells. When CD47 is bound to the surface of a lymphocyte, the cell produces chemicals called cytokines, which help destroy invading pathogens. Studies have shown that when the number of CD47-bound microglia increases during MS, inflammation becomes more severe. Many researchers believe this could explain why MS attacks nerve cells. In addition, another hypothesis suggests that inflammation might play a role in causing menopause because the immune system responds less strongly to estrogen and progesterone. Another possible explanation is that MS has something to do with the release of an enzyme called cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), which allows your body to break down endocannabinoids, an active ingredient in marijuana that makes you feel high. COX2 appears to be activated in MS patients at lower doses of THC compared to healthy individuals. However, some studies suggest that smoking cannabis is linked to lower rates of MS. Although these hypotheses have yet to be proven through controlled clinical trials, they are worth investigating further because the findings could potentially lead to new treatments and even new ways to prevent MS.

What are menopausal symptoms? A symptom of menopause is hot flashes, which usually occur about once every two weeks","Menopausal symptoms are an important marker of the progression and severity of MS.

Q: What is the difference between menopause in women and menopause in men?

A: The menopause process starts at a much earlier age for most females than it does for males; in many cases, it's even happening before puberty. For this reason, the average age of onset for female MS is significantly lower (12 years) compared with male MS (25-30). There is no one single cause for female MS and as a result, there are also no simple treatments that will work for everyone. However, there are several things you can do to help reduce your risk.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding what may be causing your menopause symptoms, contact our Patient Care team today!","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. A person with MS has reduced ability to move his or her body, and can experience pain and numbness in their hands, feet, face, legs, mouth, throat, eyes, and extremities.

If you have MS and don't know if your condition will worsen, talk to your doctor about how to reduce your risk for developing early onset MS. You may be able to take certain medications before getting pregnant. In addition, many women with MS are diagnosed during their pregnancy, so it's important that you continue to take your medicine as prescribed during those months. If you're a woman who is trying to become pregnant, check with your health care provider about whether MS medication could harm your baby, or what other treatments might help prevent MS-related problems during pregnancy.

You should not stop taking your MS medicines unless your doctor tells you otherwise.

Cannabis Use During Pregnancy

There is no known evidence that cannabis use affects birth outcomes, including miscarriage or premature delivery. However, it's possible that marijuana use in late pregnancy may increase a woman's chance of having low Apgar scores, which indicates that your baby was born alive but less than full term. Therefore, ask your health care provider about ways to limit your exposure to THC while you're pregnant.

Women who smoke cannabis throughout pregnancy have been found to have higher rates of preterm birth. Research on marijuana smoking during pregnancy remains inconclusive because little research has been done on this subject. Because there isn't enough information to draw strong conclusions regarding its effect on fetal growth, women shouldn't start using cannabis until they're sure that it won't affect their unborn child. To learn more, read our article on Marijuana Use During Pregnancy."
79,Q: Can I pass multiple sclerosis to other family members?\nA:,"Yes. The disease is not inherited, and there are no known genetic mutations in the MS gene(s). However, it is important for you to know that a diagnosis of MS requires three or more of the following: (1) a history of MS symptoms; (2) an MS-specific test showing abnormal CSF proteins on both peripheral blood smears and MRI scans; and (3) laboratory confirmation of CD4+ T-cell counts below 100 cells/mm 3. In some cases, these conditions can be found without having had any previous diagnosed MS symptoms.

Q: What medications should I use with my medications?\nA: There have been several clinical trials (a type of study where participants take different medication for varying periods over several months or years) that look at combining various types of anti-MS medicines in an attempt to improve their side effects. Unfortunately, all of this research has so far failed to yield any improvements in symptom relief. For those who do want to try combination therapy, we recommend that you consult your physician about which anti-MS drug combinations may work best for you. If you're interested in taking these kinds of medications, please visit our Medication page.

Other Questions About MS","Yes, MS is hereditary and passes from parent to child. It can also be passed on through the blood system. There are several ways to pass it on, such as being exposed to certain drugs or having a close relative with a genetic mutation that makes them more likely to develop MS. People who have been diagnosed with MS should talk with their doctors about any possible risks of passing MS on to children.

Q: Will my doctor know if I had a brain tumor? A: Your doctor will ask you questions about your medical history. If he/she knows something about your personal history and finds the diagnosis suspicious, they may refer you for testing at an accredited neurology center. Some centers have protocols in place to screen people before allowing them to get a CT scan (electroencephalogram) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), which reveal lesions that might be present in the brain. However, many patients with suspected or confirmed brain tumors are not referred for these tests until after the first treatment course. The same is true when trying to find out whether MS is causing the brain tumors; you do not need to undergo additional scans or treatments until the first course of therapy is complete. In some cases, symptoms occur in conjunction with the onset of tumors that may not be detected until months later, even years after the initial diagnosis. Also, because there is no standard way to diagnose these conditions, physicians often perform different types of diagnostic procedures on each person, sometimes leading to confusion and potentially inaccurate results. For example, some doctors use magnetic resonance images to look for MRIs in the brain but use computed tomography (CTs) for neurological exams or blood work. Other doctors use PET scans to view the metabolism of red blood cells. These differences may lead to misdiagnosis and incorrect treatment recommendations.

Q: What happens if someone has MS and then develops a brain tumor? Do I really have brain cancer? A: Yes. Brain cancers usually grow slowly over time; however, the rate varies widely depending on the type and location of the tumor. Early-stage noncancerous brain tumors can become malignant and spread throughout the body. This can cause death by respiratory failure. Later stages of cancer, such as gliomas and meningiomas, have much slower growth rates and generally don't require surgery to remove them. Although most people recover fully from this condition, some people develop long-term problems, including speech loss, depression, impaired memory, Parkinson's disease symptoms, or dementia.","Yes. If you have multiple sclerosis, your parents or siblings may inherit the condition from either of you. You will need a statement from each of you stating that you understand and consent to being included in any future distribution. The Statement should be signed by both of you. It is important that the letter states which parent has multiple sclerosis and what symptoms that parent may experience.\nB\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \3\ As explained more fully in chapter 3 of this report, it is likely that a patient's disease status and its medical treatment may affect his or her ability to express assent or withhold assent as required under IRC Sections 401(m) and 408(d). However, because you did not file an accurate Parental Consent Form for SRA coverage when you applied, a parent cannot assert that he or she was unable to sign a statement to indicate that he or she consented to receiving benefits on behalf of his or her children. Instead, if an individual with a disability who received SRA coverage before February 1, 2000, but who does not qualify now for SRA health insurance benefits (i.e., all individuals are enrolled in Medicare), he or she may submit a valid Affidavit of Waiver or Authorization to Receive Benefits. If a person receives only limited-purpose Medicare coverage, he or she must fill out a Supplemental Affidavit of Eligibility, in addition to affirming that he or she meets the requirements for Medicare coverage. See 44 CFR Part 164.50 for more information about submitting such forms. Note also that if a noncustodial parent fails to provide documentation establishing eligibility for Medicare coverage or any other benefit under Medicare, then he or she could face penalties under Section 501 of the Social Security Act.\4\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \4\ 42 U.S.C. Sec. 651 et seq.; 45 C.F.R. Secs. 1308.5(a)(1)-1308.5(b)(2). In many cases, however, the inability to complete the form can be attributed to the fact that a custodial parent did not know about his or her child's condition until after he or she had been given notice that coverage would begin. For example, a father whose child with spina bifida was born prematurely may have had no knowledge that his son would require lifelong care; instead, he may have thought he would receive the $1,000 per month SSI benefits paid by his employer. Under these circumstances, a parent may still claim","Yes. MS is an autoimmune disease that can be passed from parent to child.

This includes exposure to toxins and viruses that cause diseases such as mites. They also face different health risks because they carry bacteria that can trigger asthma attacks. So why not consider getting one pet, especially a healthy, housebroken animal? A friend recently shared her experience with her three cats who all got sick within a two year period. Her cats were on medication to treat allergies at the time so she was unaware of any underlying problems. She has since found out that her cats had been exposed to toxoplasmosis (Toxo), a common parasite associated with diabetes mellitus. Both cats are on medication to control diabetes but do not respond well to these drugs. The Toxo infection came back to haunt them as symptoms of asthma and heart failure returned. Some cat owners will decide to put down their pets because of this, while others keep them for fear that they will suffer the same fate as their beloved felines.

You will need support from a doctor in making the decision about whether you should move forward with this new family member (if any). There may also be issues about insurance coverage. This is something that should be discussed by your doctor and/or neurologist. Some people are not able to have more than one child, so if you do decide to adopt another person who has MS, there may still be additional costs involved. You should speak directly with those individuals before deciding on additional adoption. Q: Is there anything else I should know about adoption?\nA: The process of adopting an individual living with MS must be approached carefully. If possible, it is best to work closely with your doctor and other medical professionals before starting the adoption process. Most people who are considering adopting have been through at least one MS diagnosis, and most of them have experienced MS symptoms for longer periods of time than we would like, especially as adults. They may be afraid of losing control of their body. And they may be uncertain about what they will feel and think when the time comes to make such a significant life change. In addition, many people with MS become re-diagnosed periodically. We encourage anyone contemplating an adoption to seek out information about the risks associated with MS and the risks associated with pregnancy and childbirth. It is important to note that the risk factors for MS are different for each patient. For example, some people with MS experience exacerbations of the disease after being diagnosed with MS during adolescence, while others do not. All these factors play into decisions about what kind of care someone needs prior to, or during, an adoption. A complete discussion between you and the adoption agency about your individual situation and its specific risks and benefits is very important.","The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a vaccine for MS called Rituxan that contains both the gene from MS and another gene from someone who is not positive for the gene. However, this type of vaccination cannot be passed on unless it's used in conjunction with a blood test done before birth.

Q: Is there any treatment for MS? \nA: There are many different ways to treat or manage MS, but we do have some treatments available that can help reduce symptoms. You may choose to participate in one of these research studies if you'd like to learn more about them or you're interested in learning more about your options when trying to live with MS.

Q: Will I continue to develop my disability after I die? \nA: It depends upon how long you lived with MS; some people will still experience ongoing symptoms such as muscle weakness or fatigue at least until age 65 years old. We don't know for sure how long MS remains active in your body once you stop living with it. But even though it might take several months or longer for symptoms to go away completely, the most common symptom of MS is an inability to walk without assistance. In addition, MS patients often find it difficult to get around, especially when they lose their hands or feet while working or caring for others.

Q: How can I help MS researchers understand MS better?\nA: If you would like to support our work, please consider donating to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society Research Program.

Q: I am an older adult who has multiple sclerosis, but my husband has lived full time as a volunteer at our local homeless shelter for over ten years. He has never worked, he doesn't know how to manage his finances, etc.. Is this legal?A: This may violate federal and/or state laws (if the individual lives on their own). In addition, if a person is living in a home alone then this violates state law as well. We do not recommend this arrangement because of the risk of abuse of power and neglect by someone whose primary job was caring for another person.

Q: Do you offer financial assistance to people with disabilities?A: The main purpose of MS support groups is to empower individuals with MS to lead healthier and happier lives. Our groups provide information about medications, treatments, health insurance options, and other resources available to those who need help. There are no restrictions on eligibility for group membership, however many of our activities depend on the generosity of the people attending. Some participants will also receive disability income from Medicare. For more information contact the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at (800) 933-2396.","Yes, you can. There is a 1-in-2 chance that if you have MS and an affected child, the parent of the child has MS as well. However, there are some complications for this, such as when the siblings have different patterns or types of MS (for example, if one sibling has relapsing forms of MS while the other sibling does not). Also, it may be difficult to establish who has which form of MS so it would be best to consult with your doctor to determine whether passing the disease on to another relative would be wise.

Q: What should I do if my relative refuses therapy?


A: If treatment is being refused, contact the physician directly. Do not ask others in your family to refuse treatment. Many people will try to convince their relatives to accept the diagnosis and treatments offered by the doctors at the clinic. This rarely works. The only way to end the confusion over what is happening is through honest communication between the patient and physicians, which is often difficult to achieve because of differences of opinion about what is going on.

In addition, please remember that when discussing treatment options, even with close friends, the doctor has his/her own opinions about what is best for your loved one. Please keep those opinions confidential unless you want your friend to know them.

Q: Why do some women develop symptoms after having children?


A: It is possible that some women, particularly older mothers, have low levels of sex hormones in their body from having had babies earlier in life, causing changes in the lining of their uterus. This may cause problems during pregnancy and possibly even after childbirth. These include inflammation and damage to the walls of the uterus, which can lead to pain and bleeding. Some experts believe that it is also possible that there is more than one hormone involved in these conditions.


If your doctor suspects that you might be pregnant, she will check your blood pressure every 6 months and monitor your progress toward delivery. She may need to perform ultrasound scans before and during the birth process to identify any abnormalities in the baby's development. During labor, the doctor will also examine the mother's abdomen and cervix periodically, including at the time of vaginal exams. You will probably notice a change in your pelvic floor muscles as your water breaks -- this will help her understand how much force she needs to apply during labor.


Your doctor also recommends that you avoid strenuous exercise for several weeks after giving birth, and take antacids for up to three days after labor","No, there is a limit of five. (However, if you have more than one relative with MS, your application may be denied.)\nA: Yes, but only up to the age of 21.

If you are applying for an exemption from the age requirement or disability exemption (because you're over 18), please indicate in the notes box what percentage of your income will be exempt based on the number and ages of people with whom you live and work.

Q: What if my child is living with me? How much does it matter? A: You must still meet both age requirements if you apply to join the DLA. If this applies to you, we recommend that you check out our article on how to apply in full time employment.

What happens to older siblings (over the age of 20) who don't qualify for a DLA?

We will let them stay on the family home allowance until they turn 22 years old, after which point they become eligible for their own personal allowance. If this applies to you, contact us before the end of the year to see whether we can make arrangements for you to continue to receive support through these payments even though you are moving house.

Do I need to prove my household income?

You do not need to provide proof of your household income when you apply to join the DLA. However, some people might choose to do so because it helps them get around the rules. For example, you could show your council tax bill and ask us to reduce your housing costs as part of your application if the total amount you pay in council tax each week isn't enough to cover your rent or mortgage.

The DLA also has special rules for those who earn less than £11,500 per year. If you fit into this category, you can't use the new income-related test. Instead, you'll have to have been on a low paid job for at least three months prior to joining the DLA, or you won't qualify for a DLA at all. The same goes for earnings above £18,200 per year - although those earning between £17,800 and £23,400 should already have had experience with the Income Support system. This means your claim for a reduction in benefits will probably fail if you haven't worked for at least 3 months by the date you've finished your course.","Yes. In fact, you can provide your children with a copy of your disability report and their parents' disability reports if they are over the age of 18. If there is any overlap in coverage between your children's and parent's plans, that will be considered a qualifying event for you. However, if you have more than one child and more than one of them has a qualifying event under your plan, only one of your children will qualify as having received an exemption from group health insurance. The coverage must be medically necessary and in the form of a qualified long-term care or retirement benefit plan. It cannot be part of a group health insurance plan that provides medical coverage without a financial requirement (for example, health maintenance organization). This rule applies even though these types of plans do not include requirements for preventive services.\u00a0You may also wish to review our policy on providing extra help for relatives who need it.

Q: What happens if my spouse's income exceeds my income by $2,000 and we file jointly?\nA: Under the Internal Revenue Code and regulations, joint returns are treated as married filing separately for tax purposes. If you and your spouse file jointly, then you are both subject to the same taxes. Your combined taxable income after all deductions and exemptions would be $9,250 ($7,500 + $3,750).\r

If either of you make too much money ($6,350 or less) to meet this threshold, you'll pay higher income tax rates -- up to 39.6% percent on joint filers earning more than $150,000 ($75,800 per person/$225,100 per couple). If either of you makes too little to satisfy this threshold, you won't owe additional federal income taxes at all. So, whether or not you have joint tax liability, you're still responsible for paying at least some of your share of both state and federal taxes if each spouse contributes to his or her own retirement account. This includes Social Security payments and unemployment benefits. If you don't want to contribute to a retirement account directly, you could elect to defer those contributions until retirement. You could also transfer assets from your regular retirement accounts into a Roth IRA, but doing so requires a lengthy and complicated process. Once you've done these things, you won't have any federal tax consequences for years to come unless you choose to file a return claiming a break for marital status (see question #"

Q: What do I need to know about my insurance coverage?\nA: You must have insurance as part of your health plan. All eligible MSFS employees will receive a benefit package from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The benefit packages will include benefits such as dental care, prescription drugs, eye doctor visits, vision screening and glasses, hearing aids, etc.. This should cover most medical expenses up until age 65. In addition, the employer will pay for most long-term disability benefits, which means it pays up to 100% of the employee's own compensation. If you have additional coverage at work, please make sure that you complete your claim information under ""Employee Benefits."" You can view the current benefit packages available at www.mssf.gov/benefits. If you would like more detailed information about your coverage, please contact us directly via email at msfs@msfs.org.

CAREER TRAVEL


Are there any job prospects outside of Ontario?

Yes, there are many options available. Many foreign graduate students are employed by corporations or government agencies throughout North America. Others find jobs in private practice, industry, or law. There are numerous international organizations, such as the Canadian Council on Learning (CCL), and international associations such as the International Association of Medical Humanities (IAMH). These groups provide services to international medical graduates studying within their countries' healthcare systems. The CCL and the IAMH have offices in most major cities worldwide and offer many programs designed to help doctors and medical professionals gain experience abroad.

CANADIAN RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT CENTRE


What kind of support do you have at the Canadian Research & Development Centre (CRDC)?

We provide all of our medical residency candidates with extensive, up-to-date information and resources, including research funding and scholarships. They are encouraged to participate in research related activities during their residency applications process. In addition, we host events at our CRDC location each year to celebrate our accomplishments and encourage new members. We welcome the assistance of students who would like to learn more about working on clinical rotations as part of our program. To find out how to apply, please contact us at 1-800-263-4445 (U.S.) or 613-741-6678 (Canada).


How does the program differ from the U.S.?

Our medical resident applicants go through the same application process, but we operate in different settings. At U.S. institutions, residents must obtain approval to","If you are currently working full-time as a teacher, teacher aide or administrative assistant, you may be able to get an extension of your current authorization if you work 30 hours per week (excluding overtime) for at least 12 months prior to the application date. You will need to submit proof that you have met this requirement and provide supporting documentation from your employer showing that you meet all requirements. If you have more than one job during the year in question, then the maximum number of hours you can work each calendar month is 20. For example, if you were hired on July 1, 2017 and work 40 hours total between August 1 and October 31, 2017, you would qualify for an extension. The extension could end before January 15th if there is not enough evidence provided by your employer which shows that you will no longer require 30 hours of support. Please note that students must be enrolled FULL TIME and attending school regularly. \N\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Q: What is the deadline for applying for the Student Employment Program? A: Applications for the program should be submitted beginning September 1st; however, applicants will receive notification of their eligibility on September 30th. Applications received after the deadline will NOT be considered.\r

Q: How do I apply? A: To apply through the online system, please visit http://www.nycpsf.org/ssa/. Once registered, you will have access to the online application form. Upon completion, you will receive a link to the SSSA website. The site provides instructions for completing the SSSA application forms.

For more information on MS-related activities beyond the lab, visit the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's website at www.mssociety.org/research/.

Q: What are my obligations as an individual employee? Are there specific procedures to follow if someone needs time off for medical reasons?

MS is often diagnosed during adolescence or early adulthood, so it may not appear until later that people may have other conditions that interfere with their ability to carry out normal tasks, such as learning disabilities or ADHD symptoms. When you begin your job, it would generally be appropriate for your employer to provide you with notice of any reasonable medical restrictions or limitations. If you experience any difficulty because of these medical restrictions, or you need time off to receive treatment for them, please discuss this issue directly with your supervisor (or a person authorized by the supervisor) to ensure that your role is being properly managed. You will probably be required to take leave when you need the time off; your doctor may order additional time off without prior notice, but you should communicate with your boss before taking extra time off.

Q: Do I have to report medical problems to my employer?

Yes. Your employer must notify its employees who are covered under any applicable federal, state or local laws regarding the use of drugs or medical devices that they are not allowed to carry a firearm while performing their duties unless they obtain written permission from their employer or their physician.

When it comes to employment benefits, including health insurance, your employer must make certain coverage available to all employees equally. This means that your employer must cover your medications at no cost, even if your medication is prescribed for a ""disability."" It also requires that employees receiving disability payments continue receiving those payments until the date on which the payments cease.

In addition, your employer must allow you to transfer between groups of employees on the same basis and regardless of where you live.

Some states have passed laws allowing employers to require employees who are using drug therapy to get prior approval prior to using their medications and/or participate in group therapy. However, these laws only protect against discrimination based on disability and do not affect non-drug therapy or the right of employees to share their personal thoughts or opinions with others.

Q:","Yes. The MS Society of Canada offers the following types of scholarships to students who meet its eligibility requirements. Please contact the MS Society for details on these programs: http://www.msoc.ca/scholarships

Scholarly Awards (up to $15,000 in total)

The MS Society has funded up to five academic awards each year since 2008. Applicants must be Canadian citizens or permanent residents and have received an undergraduate degree from a post-secondary institution in Canada. The maximum award is $1,000 per award; recipients may also receive an annual stipend. Scholarships are renewable annually for two years after initial approval.

To apply for any of these services, please email us at info@mssoc.ca and let us know which one(s).

Citizen Education Bursaries

For many Canadians living abroad, going back to school for free is not a viable option due to costs and the limited number of approved bursaries available. The Citizen Education Program provides low cost financing to eligible Canadian citizens studying overseas who intend to return to their home country. In addition to qualifying for this funding, the citizen student must demonstrate their intention to remain in Canada long term.

To be considered, applicants should complete an online application form. Eligible students may include international graduate students, Canadian citizens studying in another country and those enrolled in a program offered by one of the recognized faculties or schools of education located within Canada or outside of Canada.

International Student Loan

Canadian Citizens who wish to pursue studies abroad and earn non-repayable tuition fees payments may qualify for the International Student Loan. The amount and terms of the loan vary depending upon the type of program. Students may only borrow from the same lender during the specified period of time and for the length of time they wish to stay in a particular location. Each program requires","Yes. Some conditions (e.g., spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease) may allow for some flexibility in working hours, but most of the time you will be required to report your work schedule during the course of treatment or recovery periods.

To learn more about disability coverage at work, contact an MSSP representative or visit www.mspsp.org/disability.

How do I apply for a disability? How long does it take?

To apply for disability benefits from Medicare, you must apply at least 60 days prior to your expected retirement date, or within 30 days after your expected retirement date if you have already retired. If you have not yet applied for Social Security Disability Insurance, then a new application process begins once you have reached age 65. It can take several months, depending on what kind of evidence you provide in support of your claim, before we evaluate your case. You should always call us as soon as possible when you know you might need help in applying for disability benefit payments, so we can make sure we can handle your request quickly. We also require documentation from your doctor regarding all previous illnesses, injuries, and diagnoses that could affect your ability to perform your job duties, as well as any medical reports that document your ability to work safely and effectively. You may need more information than we ask for when you file your application. Please see our web pages (www.medicare.gov and www.socialsecurity.gov) for further information on how to prepare for your claim.","Yes.

83,Q: Why get episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis?\nA:,"To help others with MS, to make a difference in the lives of people who have it and to be able to continue living life after my time here. I think that's what everyone wants from their doctors.

Q: When you were first diagnosed with MS, did you know exactly how severe your illness was or was it more like a vague sense?\nA: No. It wasn't until about six months ago when I got this diagnosis that I started having symptoms of it again. The only symptoms that came back are just fatigue and general aches and pains that I don't really have much control over but if they're severe enough then it does take away your ability to do things. So for me it's not so much about knowing what's going on, I'm pretty sure I didn't know at all. As far as the severity of the disease I can say that it is very slow progressing, it doesn't feel like someone has been beating up on your body and breaking down every single one of your bones right now, but I've been saying for quite awhile now that I'll probably never walk normally again, I haven't even walked without pain since January. And it sucks because once I had to go through three surgeries and an MRI and all of that crap before getting better. But it feels good to finally be getting some relief, I mean there are still days where it makes me cry to wake up because I feel so weak and helpless and there isn't anything that I can do about it.

Q: What kind of medication is being prescribed you? A: Antibiotics or steroids or both, depending on what my health insurance covers. They also gave me a big speech about how not taking them would cause problems later on and all of these other horrible possibilities. That's not something I want to believe, it will most likely lead to another hospital stay and that doesn't seem very healthy to me. So I guess at least I know that I'm getting the best possible care out of whatever resources they provide for me. Q: How many times have you gone back to school since the diagnosis? A: Three times actually. One time I went back for two weeks to finish high school while also working a few hours a week during that period. Then I went back to work at the same job I worked at before the diagnosis, which I quit because it was such a stressful situation to deal with. This time around it was only a couple weeks before coming home. So I got a little bit older, got","I'm not sure. The idea was to treat her symptoms, but also be able to look at the cause of these things.

Q: How is she doing now and what are you going to do with your life? \nA: She's doing good. She's in good hands. It's hard when you can't work -- like I couldn't work for my own money, but I had a full time job helping other people. She wasn't having that. She had a real difficult time making ends meet. But we're going to continue working together. We have to make money. That's why we went into business. And we were able to get insurance.","The disease has progressed to the point where I am not able to function as an active participant in my life. It is a matter of survival, which means that I must find something else to do and work out my weaknesses. That's why I have chosen this path, because I want to contribute in some way to help people with MS who are in similar situations.

Dr. S.: What kind of treatments can you offer patients?

Patient 1: Most often they just need some physical therapy, but there is also medication that might be needed for their conditions such as nerve damage, muscle paralysis or loss of vision. They usually start off on a low dose of medications before slowly increasing it over time. In addition, we talk about nutrition and supplementation.

Dr. S.: How much does an average patient spend per month on MS drugs?

Patient 2: Some spend up to $2,000 a month while others only spend half that amount. However, if they go down the ""low-dose"" route, one third will spend less than $100 a month, two thirds may spend no more than $200 a month, and five percent will pay nothing at all.

Dr. S.: What kinds of tests do you use?

Patient 2: We screen every new patient through MRIs and EEGs (electroencephalograms) since the disease progresses rapidly.

Dr. S.: Who are your biggest clients and how long did you work with them?

Patients 3 and 4: Both suffered from progressive degenerative disc problems. They were initially prescribed antibiotics and steroids but found that they had very serious side effects, such as constipation, hair loss, fatigue, dizziness, depression, insomnia, diarrhea, skin rashes and weight gain. Because these symptoms occurred so frequently, they decided to stop using these medications and went back to their traditional treatment plan consisting mainly of acupuncture, diet modification and walking. Each patient was followed for 12 months, which showed remarkable improvement, even though many side effects returned. Their doctors suggested a small dose of oral statin drugs that could keep the benefits without the side effects. Patients 5 and 6 both suffer from severe neuropathy caused by multiple sclerosis. After the first few sessions, they experienced significant improvements and after eight sessions, they said they felt completely normal again, despite having to walk with a cane for three years. These cases proved to us that the medications used to treat MS and other diseases should be adjusted according to individual needs","Because you are telling me that I am not getting better because there is some physical cause for my symptoms. If your symptoms were caused by a virus or bacteria, then you would just be on antibiotics and have no more symptoms. You don't do this to people who don't have MS. And if it was a viral infection (as some other people say), the only way you could know that was from blood tests. No one wants their health tested every time they cough or sneeze. A simple cold has nothing to with MS.


Q: What is an MS-related symptom that can last years? Can anyone else tell me what those things are?\nA: There are many kinds of MS symptoms. The most common ones are muscle weakness, difficulty speaking, trouble understanding speech, loss of bladder control, and problems walking or balancing on one foot. They affect about 20 percent of patients. Other common problems include vision changes, headaches, dizziness, numbness in hands and feet, fatigue, depression, anxiety, concentration difficulties, memory problems, tingling sensation when moving parts of body, and tingling in joints like the knees and elbows. These often start while patients are still young children and continue into adulthood. It's important to remember that not all of these problems will show up right away. The brain isn't made fully until age 30 or so, after which it becomes less able to repair itself as it ages. Also, the symptoms that occur earlier in life are usually easier to treat than later ones because the damage occurs at an early stage of disease development and treatment options aren't limited as much. In fact, sometimes treating symptoms too late can actually make them worse. But even if they go away, there may come a day when they return.","MS can cause progressive neurological symptoms. In most cases, these are manageable without medication and rest in the treatment phase. However, some patients may have ongoing problems due to their neurological changes or even an exacerbation of previous symptoms (such as worsening fatigue or memory loss). In such cases, we will refer the patient for diagnostic evaluation through physical examination and tests that help us diagnose MS and its associated illnesses. If there is evidence of a relapse, we recommend that you consult your primary care physician and/or neurologist who can discuss ways in which you can improve your functioning and manage this disease.

Q: Can I take my medications while on PEGIFY?

A: Yes. You should not discontinue your current treatment unless directed by your health care provider. However, if you experience withdrawal symptoms from any medication or dietary supplement, please contact your health care professional for advice regarding appropriate consumption. The following medications should be taken with caution when taking PEGIFY:

Antibiotics (such as penicillin and cephalosporin)

Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone and hydrocortisone)

Drugs that affect calcium absorption (e.g., calcitonin, bisphosphonates and other oral anticoagulants)

Medicines used to treat hypothyroidism (e.g., levothyroxine and thyroid hormone replacement products like Synthroid)

If you experience severe constipation (diarrhea), diarrhea within 3-4 days of stopping one or more of these medicines, call your health care provider immediately for further guidance.

Q: Is it safe to use PEGIFY with other drugs?

A: No known interactions between PEGIFY and other substances have been reported. Some medications may interact with PEGIFY in unpredictable ways. This includes drugs taken together with food, including many over-the-counter medicines that you swallow, as well as prescription and nonprescription drugs. These include over-the-counter pain relievers (including acetaminophen, ibuprofen, aspirin, tylenol, naproxen, and others), sleeping pills, antihistamines (phenylephrine and albuterol), corticosteroids, diuretics, blood thinners (like warfarin, Coumadin®, Plavix® [lansoprazole], Advair® [diltiazem], and others)","When we first started seeing patients with MS, it was not known that MS could cause other medical problems such as stroke and heart attack. It wasn't until the mid-1970's when we began to see these new symptoms in our patients that we realized that this is indeed an autoimmune disease. The early treatment for this type of illness was largely based on immunosuppressive medications that were supposed to prevent or reverse the disease. However, in many cases they did no good at all.

Q: What is the most common reason why people experience MS symptoms?\nA: We now know that MS can be triggered by over exposure to a variety of environmental triggers including stress, colds, flu, viruses, toxic chemicals, air pollution, toxins from household cleaners, pesticides, food additives, etc. This list continues to grow as more research into MS is being conducted. In addition to that, there are still unknown factors involved in triggering MS including genetic differences in how the immune system works which could also increase susceptibility to MS.

Q: I've heard about certain foods causing MS, do they really cause that?\nA: Research has shown that some foods can trigger MS but you should always check your doctor if any of those specific foods have caused any signs of trouble before adding them back into your diet.


Q: How often should I check my body for signs of MS?\nA: You should look out for any symptoms like fatigue or weakness after a long period of time, especially if you haven't been active recently. If you notice any unexplained soreness, redness, or swelling anywhere on your body, please consult your doctor.


Q: How do I know when I am getting better?\nA: Your doctor will monitor your progress closely while you take the right medication and continue to keep a close eye on your health throughout your life. With proper care, even the earliest signs of MS may not become apparent and you might never know that MS had even begun!

Sources & Further Reading:","If I had an easy answer, I would say ""because the MS diagnosis is so common and so good that people assume it's pretty well established,"" but it isn't. There are lots of false positives for MS in people who aren't actually sick. For instance, I've been told that a patient with chronic fatigue syndrome who has some other symptoms is probably just depressed. And there may be a lot more to these things than a simple disease misdiagnosis. When someone gets a new neurologist at the beginning of each year, they have to prove their neurology (and sometimes medical history) on what they call ""the MR"" or ""medical records."" They're required to send back documentation about how much they slept over the past few months, how much exercise they did, whether they took pain relievers, etc. All of this is intended to tell doctors that you're not doing anything wrong with your neurological system, even if all those symptoms look like something else. Sometimes the tests are done after an MRI scan of the brain; other times it can be done right before the MRI scan. But what really matters is that they do a neuro exam, which will give them information about the way your brain processes information, especially when there's a problem. This examination is usually done with two doctors working together — one for diagnosing MS, the other for making sure everything looks fine. There aren't enough of these specialists around to test everyone every time. So many people get a new neurologist in the first year after MS diagnosis because they feel better, or they think they should be getting the same treatment they were already taking. The most important thing here is that they only diagnose you once, regardless of whether you're showing up again within the next month or year. They don't need to worry about recurrence. It's possible to learn the signs and symptoms of MS very early on, but sometimes this information doesn't come out until years later — after you've developed serious health problems unrelated to MS, like heart disease, stroke, arthritis, or cancer. There may still be a small chance that you'll develop symptoms or problems again after you recover from the initial attack. However, it's extremely unlikely, since the treatments used against the primary autoimmune process have gotten so far along that no return is anticipated.

Q: How long does it take for the body to produce antibodies against another person's immune cells? A: That depends upon the type of antibody. Antibodies make it difficult to transmit the infection to a second person (","It's so that I don't have to go back to the hospital. __________________

""Life is like riding in an elevator, you need the right keys to open every door.""","Because MS is an autoimmune disorder, the immune system attacks the myelin sheath that insulates nerve fibers from injury. That's why relapses are so common in MS patients. It's the same reason doctors diagnose diabetes and heart disease — because they attack the body's own cells that produce its energy source. This kind of damage to the brain or spinal cord leads to symptoms such as pain or numbness (migraine) during certain activities, like walking up stairs or driving.

MS is classified into five different types based on the number and severity of the neurological deficits that result from the auto-immune process. These disorders can be managed with medication but often require ongoing treatment. The main goal of this study was to look at how the drug cyclosporine could help reduce or eliminate the relapses. Previous studies have found some MS drugs work effectively in treating most cases. But few treatments are effective for all cases. If one drug were more than 98 percent effective in relieving symptoms compared to placebo, it would likely be recommended as the first course of treatment for patients. In the trial, which ran from September 2011 through April 2013, the researchers randomly assigned 15 men and women to either cyclosporine or a placebo pill. They then monitored the participants' brains and spinal cords over the next nine months using Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or MRI, scans. After nine months, the patients who took cyclosporine had almost twice as many fewer relapses — 19 versus 13 — compared to those taking a placebo. Cyclosporine was also associated with improvements in four other patient measures: pain, fatigue, sleep problems and depression. ""The results suggest that cyclosporine may be especially beneficial when used in conjunction with other medications,"" says Dr. William H. Pazdernik, lead author of the paper and professor of neurology at Stanford University School of Medicine. The research team plans followup studies at Stanford Medical Center, Kaiser Permanente Northern California Health Care System and at other health care facilities nationwide to see whether the benefits of cyclosporine continue to improve over time. The research team will present the findings Thursday, March 27, 2016, at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting in Chicago. About the Author: Alyssa Shumaker, a freelance writer living in Seattle, Washington, contributed to this story","MS is an autoimmune disease. When the immune system attacks your own body, it can cause symptoms like pain and numbness in your legs (called peripheral neuropathy), or damage to nerves that control movement (called central nervous system disorders). The most common form of MS is called relapsing-remitting MS. In this type of MS, the immune system attack your brain, spinal cord, and other parts of your body; then these areas react again with inflammation. Relapse occurs when the inflammation starts over again within several weeks. Since MS is a lifelong condition, relapses are common, and even more so during pregnancy. This is why getting diagnosed with MS as a relapse is important for you to know about before trying for a baby.

Q: What does being pregnant do to my body?\nA: Pregnancy increases your risk of developing MS. Although there has been some research on the effects of pregnancy on women who have had MS, many researchers still don't know if pregnancy is associated with increased risk for MS. However, one study found that women whose MS was treated early in pregnancy had lower levels of inflammatory biomarkers than those who were given treatment later in pregnancy, suggesting they may be at less risk from having MS than other women. As always, see with your healthcare provider before taking any medication."
85,Q: Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis\nA:,"We know that this is a very serious problem. So you need to consider the issue of whether or not there are treatments which can be offered in these cases. If we were able to find an effective treatment, would it change the direction of research?

Dr. Wainwright: Well, I don't think so. That's why we want to make sure that whatever we do, whether it's using a genetic approach or an immunotherapy approach, that we look at it in as many people as possible, and that we have follow-up studies. But if we're finding one person who shows benefit, then we'll continue on with that drug. And we're also looking for another drug that might work in this setting.

It's important to note that there may be drugs that have some activity against MS lesions but not relapses. And you may also have some drugs that are more likely to trigger relapses because they've been used before to treat other autoimmune diseases, like lupus. So how you choose between those approaches depends entirely upon your needs and your outlook on the disease. In terms of developing new drugs for MS, this isn't going to happen any time soon, certainly not within 10 years. But it's important to remember that new therapies will keep coming, and we should try to understand them better and what are the best ways to deliver them.","Yes, it is a rare cause.

Q: I have an older child who has relapsed after 1 year of treatment with cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan). Is this a serious condition? A: It can be. This disease is very similar to MS and should not be confused with the relapse associated with MS. In fact, people with the same symptoms as those seen in MS are often diagnosed with relapses of their own. So you need to get your child evaluated by a neurologist or other specialists when he/she becomes more symptomatic than usual, particularly if they have had an increase in their symptoms over time. Also check out the FAQs section on Relapse to learn about some common signs of relapses.

In general, many people with MS also experience other forms of MS (also called secondary progressive MS) which may take years or decades to develop and do not respond to therapy. You should consult with your physician for any additional information regarding any new onset of symptoms, including changes that occur while taking treatment or after discontinuing treatment.

Q: How long does it usually take for MS to go away? A: MS is a chronic disabling disease that typically progresses slowly and steadily throughout the course of life, but sometimes the progression is faster or slower. If you have been treated for MS for several months, you may want to continue your treatment. If you've been getting well during the past few years, you may no longer need treatment. When it's just started, there is a lot that goes wrong. So talk with your doctor and ask how much you should stick around for.

Q: Can my family member who has MS work? A: Yes, but it will depend on your individual circumstances. Some people with MS have problems lifting heavy objects, so they might want to avoid such jobs until the disease has gone into remission. Other workers might be able to work safely. And others may find working harder rather than less difficult since most tasks are now easier for them because of the loss of muscle strength.

Q: What do I tell my spouse or partner who has MS? A: Talk to your physician about any concerns that might arise related to MS at home. Sometimes spouses or partners of people with MS find it helpful to keep track of what medications are being taken. They can then discuss these medications with their husbands or wives before they start or stop taking them. The medication regimen will be different for each person depending upon their specific needs, but there may be some overlap.","""No, you're wrong. I'm doing it."" Q: Can you tell me when your first relapse occurred? A: ""I don't remember the exact date but I was probably in my late 20s or early 30s. At that time I had a couple of flare-ups and then for awhile I wasn't able to get out of bed. It's been a long process, but I think we're finally getting there now."" Q: How has MS affected your relationships with family and friends? Do they understand the disease? A: ""My parents have always understood my condition, so that helps. I've never lied about being diagnosed. They still know what it is, which makes them very supportive. My wife doesn't understand why she can't walk; she goes through the motions, but I guess she understands the difference between a physical injury and an emotional one. We also have our kids who are older than us, and sometimes those things bring up questions about their understanding and how they want to be involved."" Q: What would you like people to know about relapses? A: ""You only have one life. If something good happens after the initial relapse, great! You just have to work on the next thing. There isn't anything you should do because of a relapse. Life is too short. People should respect that. When you've got cancer, you want people to see you as strong as possible and try and give you a chance to live your best life. But you don't necessarily have to recover all at once; this way you can focus on learning new skills and becoming stronger and healthier for longer periods of time."" Q: Did you ever consider taking prescription drugs to reduce symptoms? Are you currently using any medication? A: ""There were times over the years where I did take anti-seizure medications -- especially during my second or third relapse. The idea was not to do it every day, but if needed you could manage the pain and side effects and still maintain your daily activities. Sometimes that's not enough to keep you going, though. Sometimes I'd feel like giving up and just letting everything go back to normal again, but that didn't happen often. Instead, I took a break from anti-seizure medication and started eating better and exercising more. That helped me quite a bit, actually. And I found some really good natural treatments. So I'm working on trying to find ways that might help control these relapses without having to use a drug or have other problems. It","What is this?

A: It's a condition where there are repeated relapses of the disease, often within just days. The person might have had an early relapse that was so severe it caused them to lose all function in their legs and arms or even kill them from damage or infection. Or they might be able to get through one relapse but then find themselves unable to walk for weeks or months after. Often they can't move at all without help. Then, with another relapse, they may fall down. And the cycle continues until either the person dies or gets better again.


The more serious type of relapsing remitting MS (RMS) has symptoms such as weakness on one side of your body, numbness on your feet, loss of muscle tone on one side of your face or hands, and problems with speech, balance and vision. People usually develop some degree of disability after relapsing for a short time, sometimes only days or weeks. But as the disease progresses, you'll experience worse symptoms until eventually your whole body is affected and you can no longer see anything clearly. A few years ago, people who were treated with steroids called glucocorticoids were found to get better rapidly when they first began treatment because they could control the inflammation associated with the disease by taking drugs. However, after about six months or so, when they stopped using these drugs, many of those patients got worse again. They were left vulnerable to other types of infections, which could cause further relapses.


Because so much research has been done on drug therapies, we know what causes relapsing remitting MS. We also understand how the disease affects different parts of the brain and spinal cord. This knowledge helps us understand how to treat RMS. There are several things that are known about this disease, including:


* When an immune system attack occurs, cells inside your nervous system become damaged. These changes can lead to nerve cell death, which leads to paralysis or a loss of mobility. In recent years, researchers have begun studying ways to stop the immune response before the damage to the nerves takes place, and thus prevent a cascade of events that ultimately kills nerve cells. Drugs are currently used to suppress the immune system. Some of these medications work well and others do not. Scientists are working hard to improve the effectiveness of treatments and discover new ones. If we succeed, we will likely have treatments that give people back their independence and ability to move around completely independent of any external support.


* Because R","That's correct.

Q: How do you know that? A: Because I'm a scientist and I've looked at it. So, I don't want to say that because they're saying it doesn't work. But if people were doing a lot of research on this topic, they would have already been able to tell us that. They'd be seeing results in many different studies. You can't just make something up. It isn't possible. Q: What else is there to the story? A: If someone was talking about an unproven theory and then someone came along and proved them wrong, then that person could be called a liar, or a charlatan, or whatever. And yet, when scientists talk about a scientific principle they don't like, such as HIV causing AIDS, we are expected to accept that the theory has not been proven. Why should the public believe a statement that hasn't been proven? As a matter of fact, we wouldn't want to accept something without proof either. We need to go on believing what our senses tell us, whether it's true or false. This may sound absurd, but it's a pretty simple concept; we need to trust our senses, especially since many of these same scientists who say HIV causes AIDS are also members of the medical establishment which says HIV does cause AIDS. But again, why shouldn't we believe their sense? If science teaches us anything, it teaches us how to think critically. Q: Do doctors actually believe that HIV causes AIDS? A: Well, no one is going to take your word for it. The doctors we spoke with said yes, they definitely believe that HIV causes AIDS. Dr. Andrew Wakefield is probably the most well-known. He wrote a very famous paper back in 1998 claiming that this virus caused AIDS in some people (as he termed it) and the Lancet newspaper published his report. The report had to be retracted by the Lancet after extensive criticism from numerous medical authorities, including the chief editor himself. In 1999, the British government appointed him to head a panel of experts looking into the safety of the MMR vaccine. In 2002, the British Medical Journal investigated Dr. Wakefield's work and found that not only did he misrepresent the data he presented, but his study methodology was ""fundamentally flawed."" The journal further concluded that it was ""virtually impossible"" to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing the MMR vaccine to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine because those vaccines contain both live viruses and dead ones. However,","Yes

Q: Reactivation of an auto-immune disease after a remission?A: No

Q: Reactivating latent HIV, having a negative PCR test with positive immune globulin, and then getting a second negative PCR result.A: The PCR results were inconclusive; it was unclear if this was the original infection or just the immune response to the antigen presented by the viral load in that patient's blood (see above). It is possible that antibodies against this virus can be detected on subsequent serologic tests and could therefore be false negatives, but it was impossible to conclusively determine whether this was the case here as there may have been an increased level of anti-HIV antibodies at the time of the first test.

Q: I'm not sure about the duration of symptoms, do you have any idea how long we will need to wait before we can start treatment for this person?A: Generally, MS drugs don't begin to work until 6 months post-infection.

There is a lot of evidence that patients with multiple sclerosis relapse when they are in remission and then relapse again when they regain their MS. So it's important to stay on track, keep your medication and do everything you can to prevent relapses.

Q: What are the other benefits of the drug?

A: The most notable benefit is that there appears to be a reduction in nerve cell loss with the use of CSL-2. There was also some improvement in clinical progression. For people who have relapsed after treatment with corticosteroids or other disease modifying therapies, this may help them avoid a relapse and allow for more time for recovery. This kind of therapy can often provide a better outcome than what would otherwise occur if an individual took these drugs on their own. However, because it has not been studied as well as other treatments for MS, we do not know how long they will last in the body.

This study only looked at one drug used to treat MS and many questions remain about its efficacy, safety and long term effects on patients. So far, we believe that our results add to the body of knowledge about the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory medications in treating MS.","Anecdotal reports that a patient who is relapsing remitted MS had a positive biopsy result for antibodies to TNF, which was the same as one of your patients. Is this an example of a drug-induced remission?

MRS: Biopsies are not diagnostic and cannot be used to diagnose MS. They can only be used as indicators in the case of suspected disease. In other words, they do not exclude or confirm disease. The fact that a patient with relapsing remitting MS has received a positive biopsy for IgG anti-TNF does NOT mean that he/she will get better from treatment. If a patient is considered at risk for relapse, then he/she should have another MRI (or another imaging test) performed.

Q: Do you recommend that every patient undergo a double-blind placebo controlled trial of an agent such as SOD1? And if so what kind of results would be expected?

MRS: Most important, we need to know why a patient gets better after being treated with an antibody. To answer these questions, one needs to evaluate an individual's response to treatment. This requires having an accurate biopsy. That means that a patient must first agree to an appropriate biopsy protocol before the doctor or laboratory begins doing it.

This means that there is no way to tell whether the patient has any potential benefit from treatment until she decides to take part in a clinical trial. It also means that there is no control group of healthy individuals. In order for an investigator to determine whether it's worthwhile taking a medication, he must assess both how much improvement a patient receives from his medication versus how well he responds to a placebo or sham treatment. Without good baseline data from a single person, we cannot make reliable conclusions about the efficacy of treatments like this. It's very possible that it could be true that something else happens, such as inflammation and immune system overreaction, that accounts for the patients' improved symptoms. However, because there isn't any evidence to suggest that this happens, I would not recommend that we try this approach.","Yes, we've seen that a few times.

Q: How do you diagnose multiple sclerosis? A: That's a good question. We usually use several different tests to try and diagnose MS. The most reliable one is called the double-blind study [a study in which neither patient nor physician knows who has been given an experimental drug or placebo]. It allows us to compare patients with those on other treatment regimens without bias.

Q: Why did you decide against trying to treat people with multiple sclerosis by using steroids? A: With our previous research, we looked at whether there might be any beneficial effect of steroid injections for some patients with relapsing MS; however, this was not a study designed to specifically assess whether such therapy could alleviate symptoms. More recently, researchers from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society have done a very rigorous randomized controlled trial examining the potential benefits of a number of treatments (including drugs) to reduce disability in those with relapsing forms of MS. However, due to their small sample size, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about possible efficacy based upon these results alone. In addition, because many medications are available over the counter, many patients may already be taking them as well. Therefore, further studies should look into more extensive use of steroid medication in people with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Q: What is a relapse? A: At least 5 months after stopping a long-term steroid regimen, relapse can occur if the person has had a major flare up of illness. This may result from either an allergic reaction caused by the anti-inflammatory properties of steroids or increased sensitivity to a secondary infection. These flares could also represent immune system attack on the bone marrow cells responsible for producing new white blood cells in the body. During these flares, pain is severe and fluctuating. Sometimes the disease progresses rapidly into acute exacerbations of symptoms such as numbness, weakness and fatigue. Other symptoms include fever, facial edema, night sweats, weight loss, eye irritation, and malaise. This acute phase typically lasts 3 weeks and can last 1 month or longer depending on the severity of the episode. For many years, doctors didn't think it would ever happen to someone else after they stopped taking their steroid pills. But now they're seeing more and more people relapsing after stopping these pills. Q: What kind of side effects are associated with steroid withdrawal? A: Steroid withdrawal produces physical changes and possibly serious infections. Some of these side effects involve fever, headaches, skin rash, muscle ac"

Questionnaire for disability rating of the major and peripheral nerves and brainstem syndrome (MDDS)\r


The MDDS is a questionnaire that determines whether you have a secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) or a primary progressive MS (PPMS). The score in this category ranges from 0 to 25. Your score will be assigned based on how your symptoms compare with those of people who do not have the condition. If your scores are above 20 you may qualify for disability benefits under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), if your scores are below 15 you may not be eligible. A score higher than 30 indicates a greater likelihood that you have SPMS. This is also known as a grade 3 or 4 case of SPMS. It can be very challenging to distinguish between an individual with PPS and a person with SPMS, especially since both conditions occur at roughly the same time in life and the two conditions often present together in the form of joint pains (joint pain and spondyloarthritis). The criteria used to determine which group you fall into depend upon the type of symptoms that were reported by patients (e.g., sensory, motor, psychiatric) and their age when they first presented with these symptoms. For more information about the MDDS and how it applies to you please contact the office nearest you directly.


What happens next?

You will then undergo medical evaluation by a neurologist or physical therapist. We use computerized neurological testing to determine the extent of any nerve damage and its severity. We take blood samples to test for clotting factors and monitor cholesterol levels. You may receive treatment using injections or medication, either alone or in combination with exercise therapy. As indicated by the doctor performing your tests and examination, we believe that there are no significant risks associated with your treatment. However, we cannot assure you against some side effects. These include allergic reactions, gastrointestinal problems, sleep disorders, urinary retention or incontinence, muscle cramps, headaches, increased risk of infection, dizziness and nausea. Other possible side effects include seizures, mood changes, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, loss of appetite, depression, anger, anxiety, insomnia, headache, diarrhea, skin rash, rashes, and impotence.

[0116] Q: What is the difference between secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and primary progressive multiple sclerosis? A: Primary progressive MS occurs first, but there are some important differences. [0117] Q: Why do many people have signs of both? A: It's not unusual for a patient with one to develop symptoms later in life as well, which may be related to inflammation or other factors that are independent from the disease process. [0118] Q: When does a person become symptomatic after having been diagnosed with secondary progressive MS? A: The risk of being affected by secondary progressive MS increases dramatically when the disease has progressed to the point where it affects daily activities such as walking. [0119] Q: How can I tell if I've developed signs of secondary progressive MS? A: There will usually be an increase in your body mass index (BMI) at puberty. If you're underweight at this time, you may need more weight loss before your BMI drops back down to normal. Also, the type of physical activity you do will determine whether you progress further into secondary progressive MS. For example, those who spend most of their days sitting, especially if they wear wheelchairs, may experience less rapid progression into secondary progressive MS. You'll need to make decisions about how much exercise and what types of activity you do to keep your condition stable. [0120] Q: Where can I find out more information about secondary progressive MS? A: More information about MS treatment, including symptom management, is available through the National Multiple Sclerosis Society on its website.

3. What is the difference between primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis?

a. Primary progressive MS includes all forms of PPMS where there are focal lesions on the brain, spinal cord or optic nerve. b. Secondary progressive MS refers to those cases where there are no focal lesions on the brain, spinal cord or optic nerve but symptoms begin after a certain age and have progressed over time with neurological deterioration. c. In the late stages of PPMS, relapses occur. d. Some individuals develop progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in their first year of life when they are still very young. e. There is no cure for both types of MS. f. The condition can be controlled by medication and/or surgery, which usually involves removing lesions from the CNS through surgical excision or excision with radiation. g. People who experience partial recovery from PPMS may have more severe symptoms later in life; however, this does not necessarily indicate that they will develop advanced neurodegeneration or death. h. The clinical course of PPMS varies based upon its onset, the location of lesions and the severity of symptoms. i. It typically starts before 20 years of age. j. The majority of patients present at an early stage where there is often no clinically significant progression until about 60 years of age. k. PPMS tends to start with an attack (spasm), which last 2-5 minutes and then subside without lasting damage or disability. l. An individual's risk of developing permanent disability or death increases significantly as his/her risk of other chronic conditions increases. m. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathies do not always cause disease that progresses to multiple sclerosis. n. There is no effective treatment for either type of MS. o. These disorders affect people of any age, including children. p. Treatment options include medications and/or surgeries. q. Patients should be evaluated for potential coexisting medical conditions such as HIV infection or thyroid disease prior to having the procedure done. r. If a patient has had one episode of PPMS, he/she should be evaluated for further episodes within 1 week of surgery. s. Surgery cannot reverse damage caused by previous episodes of PPMS. t.

SIDE EFFECTS OF SPINAL CORDIOLIN EXTRACURRILISATION*

Elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels have been reported in patients with spinal cord injury, including atrioventricular septal defects and cervical dissection. Elevation of CSF proteins has been associated with peripheral nerve compression (e.g., primary axonal neuropathy), decreased myelination and impaired axon regeneration (secondary stroke). In addition, elevated CSF glutamate may contribute to the pathophysiology of secondary stroke. As such, it is important that the physician consider all possible neurologic complications when performing spinal cord surgery.

Risks related to spinal cord surgery include infection, bleeding, thrombosis, muscle atrophy, respiratory depression, and central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. Spinal cord surgery can also be associated with increased morbidity and mortality compared to other surgical procedures; however, most cases of spinal cord injury are non-traumatic. However, if there is a suspicion of injury or disease (i.e. suspected or confirmed MS, ALS, etc.), patients should undergo detailed evaluation before initiating spinal cord surgery.

Treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome by interferon beta-1a therapy

The effect of intramuscular interferon beta-1a therapy on the progression of chronic fatigue syndrome in healthy volunteers has been evaluated in three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. The results have shown that there is a statistically significant improvement in fatigue severity as measured by the Pittsburgh Fatigue Inventory score at 12 weeks from the start of treatment. In addition, the percentage of patients who responded to the first dose of interferon was similar between the active (10 mg/day) and inactive (placebo) groups at 4 weeks (12%). This suggests that this drug may be useful for treating fatigue associated with chronic fatigue syndrome. Furthermore, when compared with placebo, the incidence of adverse events was significantly lower in the interferon group at baseline (3% versus 10%, respectively). At 24 weeks posttreatment, there were no clinically meaningful differences between the two groups in terms of quality of life or other measures related to disease activity. Further studies are warranted to evaluate whether higher doses of interferon β-1a or its main metabolite interferon beta-1b could increase fatigue severity in some patients.

Efficacy of intrathecal administration of interferon beta-1a in the treatment of refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)

In vitro cell culture and mouse model studies indicated that intrathecal injection of interferon beta-1a administered by subcutaneous route could stimulate proliferation of human B-lymphocytes. These effects appeared to be mediated through the inhibition of cyclin D1 expression. Intrathecal immunization against an adjuvant containing the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, autologous bone marrow transplantation, or both, increased the numbers of CD19+ cells in vivo. Administration of high levels of interferon alpha-2b (40 μg/kg), the highest dose tested to date, significantly decreased the number of CD19+ cells but did not alter cytokine production. In conclusion, intrathecal delivery of interferon alpha-2b appears to enhance allogeneic B-cell expansion and the function of the immune system.","Multiple sclerosis.

Q: Is there a good clinical trial to prove that the natural treatment of MS is curative?

A: Yes, there is a randomized placebo-controlled study (RCT) called Efficacy and Safety of Cytokine Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis, which was approved by the FDA in 2008. There have been only two published studies on the benefits of the anti-inflammatory cytokines in humans (Cytokinetics in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis: A Randomized Controlled Trial and Cytokines for CNS Toxicity in Patients with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis). The results from these two studies were positive and demonstrated that the administration of IL12 and IL8 for 6 months reduced the number of relapses as well as improved the quality of life in patients with relapsing MS. More recently, an RCT has shown that IL6, IL18, and IL10 can decrease brain inflammation associated with Alzheimer's Disease. These findings are exciting and suggest that this type of treatment could be beneficial for other neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, several small trials have found that the injections of IL20 reduce symptoms and slow disease progression. However, more research is needed before any long term data can be presented.

Q: Why aren't we seeing enough MS patient participation in clinical trials?

A: Because it is very hard to get funding to conduct a major medical trial like this. Currently, there are approximately 3 million people living with MS in the United States alone. Most individuals who do participate in clinical trials receive either a grant or a stipend. While we believe that everyone should have access to care through insurance, many patients cannot afford these costs so they often choose not to participate. As such, if you don't qualify for coverage through your employer, you may still be able to take advantage of private insurance and/or Medicaid to help pay for your care. In addition, in some states, health plans may also cover the cost of therapy but must charge additional amounts depending on what medication and procedure is used. For example, if you use a laser for hair loss, then the laser company will likely bill you at a higher rate than if you simply go to the pharmacy and pick up the medicine yourself. Another option is to enroll in Medicare Part D which provides subsidized drug coverage for those 65 years old or older (see below), or a private plan. Finally, you may still be eligible for free screening tests via www.medicare.gov/","Multiple sclerosis A. Tumor in the spinal cord (sarcopenia)B. Brain lesions from primary progressive multiple sclerosis\oI. Primary progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy\pI. Primary progressive sclerosing panencephalitis

Treatment of primary progressive multiple sclerosis with antiepileptic drugs is difficult, and there are no approved drug regimens for this type of disease. Treatment consists primarily of symptomatic control through analgesics and antihistamines that have minimal side effects.1-3 The main aim of treatment is to increase motor recovery by controlling the inflammation caused by the brain lesion.4 It has been proposed that the addition of methylprednisolone may alleviate symptoms, but further studies are needed to determine whether this approach is effective in patients.2,5

The first clinical case series describing a patient treated with steroids was published almost 20 years ago,6 with the publication of additional cases of steroid use over time.7 In 1989, Cairns8 described a 28 year old woman who had progressed rapidly with progressive focal neurologic signs in both eyes. She received corticosteroid injections weekly throughout the course of her illness. Eventually she developed partial visual loss; however, her vision was partially restored after a course of oral prednisone. Following the publication of the study of Cairns,9 other reports on steroids were reported.10,11 More recently, a series of 16 patients with Sjogren's syndrome 12 and progressive unilateral paralysis who began steroid therapy during their second or third year of illness 12 described how steroids continued to be used until 6 months before death.13 These cases provided more evidence of benefit to steroid therapy than previous reports.14 The lack of consistent findings regarding adverse events and efficacy among these reports suggests that steroid therapy may cause serious complications if not carefully administered.15,16

In 2003, Jang et al17 conducted a prospective multicenter trial comparing the effectiveness of intravenous dexamethasone versus placebo in the treatment of patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis. They found a significant reduction in disability scores at 3 and 6 months, suggesting that dexamethasone could be safely used in patients who responded to corticosteroids. However, they also noted that the response rate was low at only 31% in this subgroup, making it unlikely that all of the patients would achieve a response. In 2006, we followed up those patients whose corticosteroid treatment was stopped early when symptoms declined.18 Of 17 patients treated with","Multiple sclerosis, nCIS

Vitamin E deficiency is common","the etiology and symptoms of fatigue in MS \r

MS is a disorder characterized by chronic pain, loss of strength and mobility, sleep disturbances, and an exacerbation of other health problems. Many MS patients experience fatigue with or without other symptoms that can be debilitating, disabling, and disabling to their quality of life. MS often goes undiagnosed for many years, which leads some patients to have significant disability as well as to suffer from symptoms that impair functioning at work and home. The current study aims to identify potential risk factors and treatments targeting these common fatigue/disability symptoms in MS. The results will help clinicians better understand this complex condition and provide them with information about specific treatment options.

The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate whether there were differences between individuals who report fatigue-free periods during MS course and those who do not in terms of their responses to three self-reported questions related to cognitive functioning (e.g., memory, attention, executive function). Additionally, it was expected that fatigue-free intervals would correlate positively with performance on cognitive tests assessing executive function performance, but that it would be non-significant in relation to measures measuring memory or attention. Lastly, we sought to determine if fatigue was associated with changes in physical activity levels among people reporting fatigue-free periods. In addition, fatigue-free interval status was assessed using a validated questionnaire and multiple measurements of fatigue. These variables are presented in Table 1.

Cognitive Functioning Questionnaire

This questionnaires has been shown to be sensitive to biological age, gender, race/ethnicity, education level, physical ability, alcohol consumption, smoking history, and use of medication. In fact, the most commonly reported symptoms of fatigue in MS are not exactly the same across all studies. Therefore, our primary measure of cognitive function was the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), a 16 item test of mental stability and cognition based upon the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory [30]. We asked participants to rate their cognitive abilities using the following items: ""In general, how well would you describe yourself?"" followed by ""How much trouble would you say you get every day?"":

I am not very good at remembering things: I need time to organize my thoughts before I can remember things easily;

I rarely forget anything important;

My thinking process isn't always easy or quick;

I tend to think in pictures rather than words","I have a question about the cause of my fatigue. I am starting to get a lot more tired and can't keep up with my daily work duties, how do you think this is caused?


Thanks!

(I don't know if it's just me or not but since this has been asked by so many people here, I thought I'd add my answer)

This might be related to your other symptoms, as many things that are not related to MS can affect your sleep such as headaches, neck pain, back pain, joint stiffness, etc... For example, some people who take an over-the-counter headache medicine report feeling worse during the day on days when they were taking their medication, and then feel better after the drug wears off...this would also apply to anxiety and depression. If these feelings persist, it may be worth having a neurologist look at them for possible underlying problems.

For example, I had a symptom called ""exhaustion"" that started happening around Christmas time (early January), I was already getting a little tired from being in school most of the year, and when I looked into it further, I found out that I had a very rare genetic condition called Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). The gene responsible for DMD is present in only one person in every billion (1 in 50,000 people), hence the name Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.. The main symptom of DMD is muscle weakness (a limp), which is why this disease makes people feel pretty much completely worthless. Also, although there are other muscular disorders like lupus, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy usually shows up first in its milder form, typically between the ages of 16-18 years old, and it tends to improve before showing up in any severe form at all later on (usually after age 40-50 years old). As far as this illness goes, we really don't understand what causes it - whether it is due to something in the body itself, or because of a problem in the brain causing the muscles to weaken, or both...at least at the moment we aren't able to find anything specifically that will make people with DMD stronger, or live longer. We've done studies trying to see if certain drugs can help control symptoms of DMD, but we haven't managed to show any improvement yet in terms of DMD symptoms.

The bottom line is that there isn't anything specifically that can actually cure D","the common pathway of fatigue A2B: the pathophysiology of fatigue C1D: the underlying mechanism of fatigue D: management and prevention E: other important issues 1. The common pathway of fatigue (also known as the'motor fatigue syndrome') is characterised by a pattern of muscle weakness, muscle twitching or tingling sensations in the arms or legs that persists for days to weeks or even months after a period of rest, and is more likely to occur with physical activity than without it. This fatigue occurs at a time when muscular strength has returned to normal. Muscle weakness, or stiffness may result from damage to the muscle fibres themselves which are not completely healed. These damaged fibres can no longer conduct electrical impulses normally. Muscles become unable to contract effectively and are less able to produce force. It is this loss of voluntary energy output that makes some people feel tired, and it leads to a feeling of being physically exhausted during the day and even throughout sleep. However, there is much debate over whether such feelings are actually due to fatigue rather than some form of muscle damage. In the absence of any exercise, the muscles will lose their ability to supply energy and so start to deteriorate, leading eventually to fatigue-related symptoms. 2. Motor fatigue is often caused by an imbalance between nerve cells in the spinal cord. It is believed that this can be prevented by restoring the balance and preventing the release of neurotransmitters that cause the problem. The most effective way to restore the balance of these neurotransmitters is through exercising the body's motor system. Exercise helps to reduce levels of lactic acid produced by the contracting muscles and also stimulates the body's immune system. 3. The 'ticking' effect seen following strenuous exercise could well be due to the fact that the nervous system is still working on recovering from the effects of the previous bout of exercise. As it recovers, the nerves grow stronger again, allowing them to communicate quickly and efficiently with the brain. 4. Some theories suggest that the reason for prolonged muscle pain in MS patients is the gradual destruction of myelin around damaged axons, but a recent study into patients who had been treated with antimalarial drugs shows that in all cases the inflammation was not due to breakdown of myelin, but to the failure of the drug molecules to cross the blood-brain barrier properly. 5. If you suspect your health problems might have a physical source (such as a weakened central nervous system), ask your doctor to check your muscles before or immediately after exercise - they may","fatigue; nB: an inability to work efficiently

Fibromyalgia

Flexibility and mobility are compromised by the muscle pain associated with fibromyalgia. In MS, there is a loss of flexibility due to the inflammation of the central nervous system, which is one reason that the symptoms often become more severe over time (e.g., after an illness or injury). Many studies suggest that the ability of individuals with fibromyalgia to walk, climb stairs, swim, swing, etc., may be reduced. The most common cause of the loss of range of motion is caused by the tightness in muscles that support the spine or neck, such as those surrounding the eyes and jaw muscles. Flexible joints can also become strained through improper posture during activities, for example, while standing, sitting, or lying down.

The muscles responsible for the movement of the head are also affected by MS, and many individuals experience headaches when they try to focus on their vision and/or move around too much. An imbalance between the brain and the spinal cord makes it difficult for people with MS to perform basic tasks such as reading, writing, or using tools. There have been reports suggesting that certain medications used to treat MS may actually worsen the physical effects of this disease, including increased pressure behind the eye, changes in vision, problems moving around, weight gain, decreased mood stability, anxiety attacks, depression, sleep disturbances, irritability, and sleepwalking.[6]

For the purpose of this article, we will consider some possible mechanisms that could contribute to the decrease in flexibility and mobility in fibromyalgia:

Damage to the nerves in the brain stem

Increased stress on the nerves in the back

Tightness of muscles around the mouth and face (i.e., temporomandibular joint dysfunction)

Muscle spasm or excessive tension

Decreased muscle tone and size

Migraines

Gastrointestinal disorders

Headaches

Nerve damage from repeated trauma (such as surgery) or drugs (eg, steroids)

Cognitive impairment

Chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)

Diagnosis

Although fibromyalgia has been considered since 1841, diagnosis has remained elusive until very recently.

There are two main types of fibromyalgia: primary and secondary. Primary fibromyalgia occurs only if it affects your entire body — i.e., you don't have any other medical conditions. Secondary fib","fatigue

Cognitive impairment.

Dementia, cognitive, and/or emotional problems (including depression) that are not improved by treatment with a second drug or by other treatments have been reported as the primary reason for discontinuation of treatment. In addition to psychological symptoms, there may be physical manifestations of dementia such as weakness, poor balance, blurred vision, and impaired coordination, which may cause an individual's ability to perform tasks to decline. The presence of these signs should raise concern for an underlying medical condition, but they do not necessarily indicate disease progression. Some patients develop milder forms of dementia with symptoms similar to those seen in Parkinson's Disease.

Symptoms and signs of dementia include difficulty remembering things; confusion about how events unfolded earlier in life; and a loss of short-term memory. These changes can also occur without any obvious cause. In some cases, it is possible to prevent the onset of dementia by controlling the patient's activities. However, others become progressively worse over time.

Treatment with the first drug has no effect on the severity of these changes in the long term. This suggests that drugs that treat Alzheimer's Disease should target different mechanisms than those used to treat other diseases. Also, it appears that the longer a person continues to take a drug, the more severe their cognitive deficits become.

TEMPERATURE EFFECTS OF PHENYLACETATE ON THE BIOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF HUMAN BLOOD, MUTAGENICITY AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIOUS DISEASE (STID) JOCELYN DICKINSON & VIVIAN GARCIA-MILES, PhD [published online October 2016] *

Abstract

Background: Phospholipids are important cellular components, and their composition is affected by temperature.

Objectives: To determine the effect of heat treatment on the biological properties of human serum albumin, phthalate metabolites (PGD2 and PPD), and phytoestrogens (phytohormone).

Methods: In vitro experiments were performed with human serum albumin; human PGD2 metabolite; and phytoestrogen, to evaluate the effects of heat treatment. The results demonstrated that all compounds reacted more strongly at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. Serum PGF 2α, PGE 2, TGF alpha 1/2, IL 8, CRP, IL6, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) increased as compared with control values at 24 °C, 28 °C, 33 °C and 38 °C but decreased when tested at 41 °C.

Results: In vitro incubations using whole blood or serum albumin resulted in inhibition of proteinase K degradation, phosphorylation of tyrosine residues and increased glutathione peroxidase activity. Serum concentrations of pyrrolidine alkaloids, dihydrotestosterone and dihydrotestosterone sulfates, and glucocorticoid receptor antagonists increased as well. No significant changes were observed in other enzyme activities, including amino acid metabolism, calcium and iron absorption, and cholesterol synthesis. No differences were found between treatments in any of these parameters. All tests showed that treatment with PGF 2 α caused inhibition of proteinase K activity, whereas treatment with PPD prevented this inhibition. In contrast to serum albumin, which was not altered by temperature, liver microsomes from treated rats showed an increase in hydroxyl radical production during heating, and this increase correlated with increases in plasma levels of 3-aminoquinone.

Conclusions: Our data show","is there an objective relationship between the severity of MS and the rate of fatigue?A: no.Fluid balance and body temperature are essential for optimal energy production and muscle function, but this was not measured with regard to MS in the present study (Dunn et al., 1998).

Consequently, we have identified a small number of factors that can contribute to MS-associated fatigue. Future research will focus on how these parameters can be manipulated or otherwise modified for improved therapeutic outcomes.","muscle pain, weakness, and/or numbness caused by TMD.Treatments for fatigue are generally limited to reducing the frequency or intensity of activities that place stress on the affected limb(s). Treating fatigue may include the following:

-increasing physical activity (increase duration) -alternating between lower and higher intensities -stretching, mobility work, and exercises to increase flexibility and range of motion -using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) -taking medications such as calcium channel blockers, beta blocker, diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, anticoagulants and aspirin, and others such as gabapentin.

There is some evidence supporting a role of magnesium supplementation in the treatment of fatigability in multiple sclerosis patients, though more studies are needed. To date, no clinical trials have been performed to determine whether magnesium supplementation reduces fatigue in persons with MS."
93,Q: Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?\nA:,"It is possible that there are links between these two conditions. \r

However, further research into this subject would be required before a definitive answer could be given. \r

The exact mechanisms of how the immune system affects sleep at the cellular level or the way it affects our physiology as individuals need more investigation to prove whether MS and other neurological disorders have similar underlying factors which affect the way we sleep. \r

\r

""There is growing evidence that several diseases can cause changes in the amount of time spent asleep,"" said Dr Mascola from Newcastle University's Institute for Sleep Research. ""This may explain why some patients with insomnia seem to suffer more from sleep problems than others."" \r

According to the National Health Service (NHS), approximately one third of adults aged 65-74 will experience some type of daytime sleepiness, including trouble falling asleep, staying asleep or getting back to sleep. \r

If you're concerned about your ability to fall asleep tonight, try these tips: \r

Get some shut eye – if you feel sleepy and unable to get off to sleep, take a short nap first thing in the morning. This can help improve your chances of falling asleep again. Get up early – don't stay out too late doing something you enjoy, like watching TV or having a drink. Avoid caffeine – it makes you tired and less likely to sleep well. Don't eat too much sugar, alcohol or tobacco – they'll make you sleepy too. Drink plenty of water – you should have a glass of warm milk to drink every four hours during the day. Exercise regularly – walking, swimming, cycling and aerobics can all keep you awake if you want to get up earlier. Take an afternoon nap – you'll still feel tired but you won't be so groggy when you wake up. You might find yourself waking up feeling refreshed. \r

Dr David Anderson, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists' health advisory committee, says: ""While sleep disorders such as insomnia are common, it is not clear how many cases are actually caused by lack of sleep and how often they are preventable. This is particularly important for elderly people because poor quality sleep affects their mental and physical wellbeing."" \r","Yes, MS is a disorder that causes the brain to lose its ability to process information properly. As a result, it often does not send out signals to tell your body when you are tired or needs rest (this can lead to an extended period of sleepiness). The most common symptom for people with MS is trouble falling asleep. Other symptoms include headaches, fatigue, pain on one side of the head, and trouble focusing. \r


Q: How do I know if my MS affects my ability to get up at night?\nA: A study conducted by the National Sleep Foundation found that more than half of adults who have MS also suffer from insomnia. People with MS may be unable to wake up at the same time each day because they cannot function as well during the daytime. This may be exacerbated in people who also experience chronic pain due to nerve damage. It's important to take a regular nighttime pill to help manage this problem. While taking naps will make you feel better throughout the day, it won't necessarily fix the underlying cause of your insomnia. \r


Q: What are some other factors that increase risk of developing MS?\nA: Another reason why people develop MS is an abnormal immune system response. An abnormal immune response increases inflammation and damages nerve cells causing them to die. In addition, certain viruses or bacteria called coxsackievirus B1 and B2 may trigger autoimmune reactions to build up in the nervous system leading to MS. One study shows that a type of coxsackievirus called JC virus is associated with an increased risk of developing MS. Other studies show that exposure to air pollution may contribute to MS development, but further research is needed to determine whether air pollution itself could play a role in the disease. Finally, there is increasing evidence that people with MS tend to eat unhealthy diets, such as fatty meat and high-sugar drinks, which might reduce the levels of vitamin D in their blood. Some experts believe diet may be just as important as medications in helping control the disease.


Q: Does eating gluten affect the course of MS?\nA: Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, barley, and oats. Studies show that people who have celiac disease, a disorder caused by an intolerance to gluten, are twice as likely to develop MS compared to people who don't have celiac disease. However, another study showed no link between celiac disease and MS. Also, some doctors believe that gluten sensitivity or intestinal infections (such as UTIs","Yes. Multiple Sclerosis is a condition that causes weakness of the muscles. It also affects your brain, which can lead to memory loss.

Q: I have been having difficulty concentrating recently. What should I do?\nA: Concentrate on remembering one simple word or phrase at a time while taking regular breaks for breathing exercises (like counting backwards). This will help you remember what you are trying to learn. If this fails then try repeating it out loud (using your voice) several times and see if that helps. Your ability to concentrate and recall important information may improve with practice. See How to Get Better At Concentrating for more tips.


Forgetfulness

Q: Am I forgetting things, and how often does it happen?\nA: In most cases it happens after a few minutes, but it can take up to half an hour for symptoms to appear. The sooner you get to know your own body, the better able you'll be to manage it. Symptoms include: fatigue, headaches, confusion, slurred speech, trouble thinking clearly, nausea, dizziness, numbness, tingling, pain and itching. For some people there are physical effects as well such as muscle tension and joint pains.

Q: Is it normal for my doctor to prescribe medication to me before seeing another specialist?\nA: Yes. Many doctors who work in primary care clinics or hospitals use medications to treat conditions like MS. However, it's not unusual for other specialists to have similar prescriptions. Sometimes these prescriptions aren't medically necessary. Talk to your doctor about your treatment options and ask if he has any recommendations.

Q: Why isn't my doctor seeing me right away when I start showing signs of MS?\nA: A good first visit is made between a couple of weeks and six months after diagnosis. This is because many patients continue to experience symptoms long after they're diagnosed. However, sometimes symptoms don't occur until years later.

Q: I have had no improvement in my MS symptoms since starting medication. I feel helpless. How can I cope with the pain of being unable to walk properly?\nA: You must understand that you cannot control everything about your symptoms. Some days you might find them manageable, others not so much. There are no quick fixes; you have to accept that things won't change overnight. Try to think positive. Remind yourself of what makes you happy and try to make the best of each day. It can be hard at times and","Yes. It is widely accepted that the number of MS patients with sleep disorders increases as we age, due to increased prevalence of sleep disorders in older individuals. Sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome (RLS), chronic fatigue syndrome, narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are all associated with MS. The symptoms of these diseases include daytime hyperarousal, daytime insomnia, frequent snoring and other sleep-related complaints.

Q: What causes MS or any autoimmune disease?

It has been proposed that MS may be caused by an immune response against nerve cells in the central nervous system (CNS). This hypothesis arose from studies showing a correlation between lesions on immunological assays for T cells and MS lesions at autopsy. However, there have also been recent reports suggesting that other factors contribute to the development of MS, including autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus (lymphocytic myelitis), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). These studies suggest that the pathogenesis of MS may involve more than one mechanism; however, it seems likely that both direct and indirect effects of cytokines play a role. Evidence suggests that the mechanisms involved may differ among different types of autoimmune diseases, but they are almost certainly not identical. For example, some studies show that IL10-producing T lymphocytes are responsible for causing SLE, while others do not. In addition, both lupus erythematosus and RA produce high levels of interferons (IFNs), which can stimulate production of proinflammatory cytokines. Several reports indicate that IFN-γ may contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of MS, although their contribution to disease severity remains unclear. Finally, evidence indicates that many autoimmune diseases are characterized by changes in the metabolism of certain hormones, and MS is no exception. Thus, these conditions appear to act through similar pathways in promoting the inflammatory cascade leading to MS.

The majority of studies assessing the relationship between autoimmunity and MS focus on the pathophysiology of specific autoantibodies; however, there appears to be little consensus about whether and how these autoantibodies interact with MS pathology. A recent review concluded that in light of emerging data, autoantibody studies were insufficient to make definite conclusions about the etiology of MS.

Autoimmune diseases also affect brain function. Multiple sclerosis is commonly thought to result in damage to the white matter","Sleep disturbance has been reported as a common symptom of MS, both in the early stages (pre-MS) and in more advanced disease. Although sleep disturbances may be caused by many factors including fatigue, pain, depression or other mental health disorders, there is also evidence that they are related to systemic inflammation.\r


Q: Do you have any concerns about how your research will impact on our understanding of the causes of MS? If so what might these impact on our understanding of MS?\nA: We believe we have found a possible mechanism for how MS develops and we plan to examine this further with larger scale studies. However, we do not expect our findings to alter current treatment guidelines and treatments. For example, given that current therapies target only symptoms, it does not appear likely that our results would change the way we treat MS patients or contribute towards developing new ways to diagnose MS, because currently only one biomarker is used and MS is diagnosed through clinical examination using MRI scans. Another reason that we don't anticipate changing existing drug development programmes is that although drugs have shown some efficacy in treating certain aspects of MS, they have no effect on how MS progresses.\r

[1] http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1136/bmj.g140025","Yes. Some studies show that MS patients with sleep-related issues have a higher rate of developing symptoms than those without such problems, so it's important for everyone who has MS to avoid getting too much sleep at night if they want to reduce their risk of developing MS symptoms. \nB: This study did not look specifically at sleep problems among the participants but rather assessed overall cognitive performance.

Dr. Ebeling is an internationally recognized expert on MS and its associated diseases, including autoimmune neuroinflammatory disease (e.g., demyelinating polyneuropathy), spinal cord injury, metabolic syndrome, stroke, and systemic lupus erythematosus. In addition to her work as a researcher in immunology, she also serves as Chief Medical Officer for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) and Board Member of several other organizations focused on research related to MS. She can be reached at ebeling@nationalmssociety.org or 703/864-5222.","The incidence of MS increases with age. Some researchers believe that this is because the disease has a ""fuzzy"" profile of its own, making it more difficult for an immune system to target certain types of cells as it goes on. In other words, in old mice, some autoimmune diseases were more severe than others (e.g., type I diabetes). Sleep disorders seem to be at least partly responsible for these differences. Some studies have suggested that changes in sleep may also play a role in other neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease. But we still don't know how much sleep plays a role in each of these conditions. Many medications used against insomnia can cause side effects such as dizziness, lightheadedness or drowsiness, which could complicate their use by seniors with sleep issues.

Sleep Apnea Syndrome

What is it? A condition characterized by repeated interruptions of breathing during deep sleep.

How common is it? About 3 percent of Americans are estimated to suffer from it; about 2 percent of those over 65.

Who gets it? People who sleep less than 6 hours a night have an increased risk of developing apnea. Apneas often involve episodes lasting between one minute and 30 seconds. They usually start when someone wakes up from a REM period — the period during which dreams occur and the brain temporarily shuts down its normal function. During these episodes, your mouth muscles relax and you breathe through your nose. Your heart rate slows and your respiratory movements become shallow. You then wake up without oxygen to continue to breathe until the episode ends.

How does it affect you? It can make it harder to fall asleep, especially if you're prone to falling asleep easily. If your sleep is interrupted regularly by loud noises, a sudden movement, or your partner talking, it can also trigger attacks of sleep paralysis, a waking sensation that usually occurs while you're not fully awake and causes you to feel paralyzed, although people with no history of the disorder have reported experiencing a similar feeling. These symptoms can interfere with your ability to perform important tasks like driving or performing housework. If you develop a sleep-related disability, you can find out whether there's any connection between your sleep problem and your physical or mental health.

Symptoms may include: difficulty breathing

increased snoring

loss of consciousness

slow and shallow breathing

difficulty swallowing

seiz","Yes. Sleep disorders are common among individuals with MS, and the symptoms of sleep deprivation can mimic those experienced by patients who have developed multiple sclerosis (MS). It is estimated that approximately half of all people over age 50 who have MS will experience some form of sleep disturbance. Although there is no consensus on a definitive diagnosis, several factors suggest the possibility of MS-related insomnia or similar syndromes in patients with MS. The following are commonly reported symptoms of sleep disorders in persons with MS.

1) Lack of REM sleep (REM-sleep paralysis)

2) Sleep apnea

3) Delayed wakefulness (e.g., sleepwalking, poor memory recall, impaired judgment)

4) Insomnia (a lack of adequate restful sleep)

5) Cognitive deficits (i.e., cognitive disorganization, confusion, impaired attention/concentration, emotional outbursts)

6) Loss of balance

7) Fatigue

8) Decreased motor coordination

9) Facial twitching/flashing

10) Muscle spasms/tremor

11) Painful/disabling headaches

12) Dizziness/lightheadedness

13) Vomiting

14) Depression


NAPLAN testing


The NAPLAN (National Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey) was used to assess sleep disturbance, fatigue and cognitive function among 982 adults aged 18 years or more living in Australia with an active MS diagnosis. The survey also assessed comorbid conditions such as depression, anxiety, alcohol and substance abuse, other neurological disorders, and diabetes mellitus type 2, in addition to lifestyle factors such as smoking status, physical activity level and diet habits. In total, 39% of participants had at least one impairment related to their sleep disorder, with 13% reporting multiple impairments.

SLEEP DISORDER AND AUTISM IN AUSTRALIA

Sleep disturbance has been found to be associated with increasing risk for development of MS in both young and older adults.

Young adult adults with a history of recurrent or persistent difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep were nearly twice as likely as healthy controls to have elevated levels of CSPV and increased sleep onset latency time. Those with MS had significantly higher prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease compared to controls.

ADULTS WITH MS WHO HAVE AN INCREASED RISK FOR SLEEP DISORDERS IN THE FUTURE","Yes. Some studies have shown a relationship between MS and sleep difficulties. The more severe the MS, the greater is the risk of developing memory problems and sleep disturbances. There are many possible reasons for these effects (e.g., changes in the body's response to hormones during sleep) that are not well understood. Sleep disorders may also be associated with other conditions such as depression, anxiety, or cognitive decline. It is important to remember that the role of REM sleep and NREM sleep (the period between dreams) in the maintenance of health and wellness cannot be neglected.

Q: Is there any evidence that aging has an impact on cognition?\nA: No. In fact, research suggests age-related declines may actually increase your brain's ability to learn new things. For example, in one study of healthy seniors aged 70 years or over, learning tests were conducted using materials that had been adapted from children's books. Those who could name more words learned significantly faster than those who couldn't.

Q: What causes cognitive decline in later life?\nA: Many factors contribute to declines in thinking skills and memory. These include physical illness (such as Parkinson's disease), medication side effects, infections, medications used to treat diseases and medical conditions (including cancer treatments), stroke, traumatic brain injury, and mental illnesses such as dementia. Studies show that Alzheimer's patients tend to experience poorer outcomes in terms of memory, problem solving, language, decision making, planning, abstract reasoning, verbal fluency, attention, and executive function.

Q: Do you know if I would benefit from treatment with certain supplements?\nA: Unfortunately, there isn't much good evidence linking specific vitamins, minerals, herbs, and nutrients directly to cognitive health and general cognitive functioning. However, there is some support for the notion that certain foods can help improve cognitive function, including: omega-3 fatty acids; green leafy vegetables (especially spinach); nuts, legumes, seeds, berries, and cruciferous vegetables (like broccoli); green tea; black pepper; calcium; and vitamin D. If you have questions about whether your supplement or food might be beneficial, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.","In the short term, patients with MS have increased daytime sleepiness. This may lead to problems at work or school because they miss appointments, go out too late for class, etc. Sleep disorders are a common problem in patients with MS. However, over time, this worsens their symptoms, especially when combined with fatigue, depression, or cognitive impairments (such as memory loss). They often have trouble getting up in the morning due to reduced muscle strength and mobility. It is not uncommon that some patients with MS report experiencing fatigue after every meal. These can be a source of stress, and it's important to make sure you're taking enough rest during your day to prevent any issues from developing. A good balance between light activity and activity will help ease these symptoms. \r

""In the long term, however, MS patients seem to benefit more than those without MS from regular sleep habits.""\r

94,Q: When will I start to feel better with multiple sclerosis?\nA:,"You need to know that MS is a progressive disease and you should be monitored by your doctor. The best way to monitor if the disease is progressing or not is to do daily exercise. Your doctor may recommend that you begin running as soon as possible. Some people experience improvement in their symptoms after just a few weeks of running, while others continue to have some degree of disability for months or even years after starting to run. Even when symptoms improve, they can recur at any time, so it is important to make sure you are getting sufficient sleep, eating healthy foods and avoiding tobacco, alcohol and drugs. It also helps to maintain an active lifestyle (such as walking) and keep up with other activities such as gardening or gardening classes, which can help reduce stress. A person who is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis may want to consider participating in a research study aimed at finding new treatments for this debilitating condition. This type of study involves taking part in an experimental treatment known as immunotherapy. These studies take place in different countries around the world, but most often involve small groups of patients who have already been diagnosed with MS, and then follow them over time until they have completed the treatment. These trials test out the effectiveness of immunotherapies on patients with relapsing-remitting MS, also referred to as RRMS. You may also be eligible for a clinical trial of immune therapy called exenatide, if you have received one of the previous three drugs used to treat MS. This drug works by targeting the body's own T-cells (immune system cells), and has already shown promising results in animal tests. In addition to completing your MS checkup, it is always good practice to discuss your health and medical history with your doctor. Although the risk of adverse side effects from vaccines like MMR, varicella and tetanus remains low, they remain a possibility, especially with long-term use of MMR vaccine. If you think you might be sensitive to these proteins, talk to your healthcare provider about what kinds of vaccinations you may still need.

Q: What diseases cannot be prevented?\nA: There is no cure for any of the viruses found in the flu shot, nor are there specific medications to prevent the illness caused by influenza. However, several common colds and seasonal allergies are generally easily avoided through simple measures including proper handwashing, using effective antihistamines and avoiding prolonged exposure to cold air. If you develop fever, cough or shortness of breath within two days of receiving a flu vaccination, contact your physician right","In the first 2 months after your surgery you should be able to have some light movements and a ""feeling"" of walking again. After that, it is still best to avoid heavy activity as much as possible until your immune system has healed, since there are many things which can cause problems during this time, such as infections, toxins, radiation or even pregnancy complications (which can also raise your risk for MS). There are also medications which may not work immediately, but will help reduce symptoms and improve your quality of life. But remember, once you start taking these medications they need to be taken correctly so that your body won't reject them by over-reacting, and in order to get maximum benefit from them you need to know how to take them. It's important to consult with an experienced MS specialist when starting out on any medication.

Q: What kind of support do I receive now?\nA: The most important thing right now is that we are working together as a team to look after each other as well as our own health. We all share a common goal – to overcome MS and live full and happy lives. You can always come visit us at Our Mission at the Centre and see what's going on and ask us questions about MS and anything else related. We hope you'll join us!

Q: How much does Multiple Sclerosis cost?\nA: For the majority of patients MS costs between $11000 - $30000 per year. Many people say that they would prefer not having MS, because it means living with one chronic disease rather than several. However, if you can afford it, MS can make a big difference in your quality of life. All of our programs include an initial checkup with our registered nurse(s) where you can learn more about MS and get a basic understanding of what the treatment plans are and the risks involved. Also, every patient who participates in our program receives a complimentary pair of orthotics and/or braces which provide substantial improvement in their ability to walk. We offer a variety of different packages depending on your individual needs. You can find out more here: http://www.multiple-sclerosis.ca/health-care-coverage-and-benefits/. Please note that our fees are based on a sliding scale. Some memberships are available only to eligible individuals, while others are open to everyone. All memberships are valid for 1 year from date of activation. Additional fees and services are subject to change without notice.

Q:","As MS progresses, your ability to move around the body becomes restricted. This may cause you difficulty in walking and running, as well as other activities that require balance and coordination. Although MS is not curable, early treatment can help improve symptoms and lead to a more complete recovery.


If symptoms become worse, see your doctor or neurologist for a medical evaluation. You may be referred to an MS specialist, such as a neurologist.

Preventing MS by Keeping Healthy While Having Multiple Sclerosis

You have several health benefits from living with MS and keeping healthy while having multiple sclerosis. For example, research shows that MS can decrease your risk of getting heart disease, cancer, stroke, kidney problems, osteoporosis (low bone density), depression, and even diabetes later in life. Some people who are at higher risk of MS also have a lower risk of developing heart attacks, strokes, kidney diseases, breast cancers, ovarian cancer, gallbladder disorders, prostate cancer, and other cancers and heart disease. In addition, some studies indicate that those with MS have better sleep patterns than people without MS.

While it's impossible to predict how long this type of study might last, recent evidence suggests that MS doesn't affect everyone equally, although many people develop new symptoms with time. The treatments that make sense when treating MS patients aren't always effective when treating people with MS without the condition. There's no reason to stop taking these drugs unless you want to. It just means you need to take them correctly. If your neurologist prescribes certain medications or therapies for you, they may be helpful if used properly. But don't ignore important questions about what other medicines you should avoid and whether you're overmedicating yourself.","The best time for you to begin feeling better is when your doctor says that it's safe for you to move about. For most people, this means the second or third week of your first treatment. However, after a while, things can get more difficult, and you may need to be on an extended course of medicine. This is because multiple sclerosis changes over time -- some people develop fewer symptoms in their 20s than in their 40s. That's why doctors are cautious about prescribing long-term medicines for people who have MS at any age. At the same time, even though multiple sclerosis progresses rapidly during adolescence, you should not wait until later. It would be irresponsible not to try to protect yourself from MS by taking steps now. If you do decide to stop your MS medication, you'll have to take it every day for several months before it starts working again. (The dose you receive will depend on how many treatments you've had.)

Q: What else does Multiple Sclerosis cost me as a teen or adult?\nA: Most insurance companies don't cover MS therapy. Some states require insurers to provide coverage; others aren't sure whether they must. Insurance premiums range from $200 to $1,000 per month for the annual out-of-pocket costs. Your family could pay much more if you're covered by Medicaid, Medicare or other health plans. There are several ways to help reduce these costs: 1) Make a list of friends who have MS and ask them to contribute money or donate books to Goodwill, thrift stores or community centers. 2) Join a group support program such as Parents of MS or MS Awareness and Support Group. 3) Take advantage of free educational programs or clinics offered by local churches and schools. 4) Check with local MS organizations to see what discounts or scholarships may be available. 5) Talk to your college about getting financial aid for tuition and related expenses associated with MS. 6) If you live outside the U.S., check into international scholarships or grants through www.msfoundation.org/scholarships. 7) Look into charities that give awards in exchange for donations such as the American Autoimmune Related Disease Association. 8) Donate used clothing at goodwill, charity shops and recycling centers. 9) Contact the National Multiple Sclerosis Society for assistance with donating used eyeglasses. 10) Consider enrolling in the Student Financial Assistance Program at your university or college. 11) Visit the National Multiple Sclerosis Society website for information on other free resources.","Your symptoms and progression are very important factors in determining if you should undergo treatment. It is possible that the course of MS can be controlled by your ability to control your symptoms or progression. If you have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, you may need to take medications for some time before we can determine if you are improving.

Q: What do I need to know about my health insurance coverage?\nA: The federal government requires all employers with 50 or more employees to offer health benefits through an employer-sponsored plan. If you are uninsured, you must purchase a qualified health plan or apply for Medicaid or CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program). You can learn more about these programs on http://www.healthcare.gov/individuals/. There are also many private plans available through the individual market.

Q: How much do I need to pay?\nA: Depending on your situation and how you qualify for help, there is a wide range of what you may owe per month. We recommend taking the average price list from any of the websites listed below. Some of these estimates are slightly higher than others. Once you find out how much you can afford to pay, talk to your doctor about reducing your monthly payments.

How Much Does My Multiple Sclerosis Monthly Bill Cost? (2013)

Monthly Total Payment Amount Single Person $1,079 Family of Two $2,085 Couple of Two $3,090 Married Couple $4,010 Family of Four $6,060

If you live alone, you may be eligible for financial assistance. Contact us at 800-332-3435 if you believe you may qualify.","You can expect improvements in MS symptoms and function over several months to a year.

Q: How do you know if my MS has been cured or is still progressive?\nA: Your doctor may want to check your response to therapy, especially those treatments that are considered experimental (such as the ones shown in this review). Even though we cannot cure MS completely, many people report dramatic improvement after starting an experimental treatment.

If you have any questions about how long to take each of the specific tests mentioned here for your MS, talk to your health care provider.","Your symptoms of MS are usually worse during the first few months after diagnosis. You may have a flare-up, or flare-ups can happen at any time throughout your life. The more you practice, work hard and live a healthy lifestyle, the less likely it is that you'll get another flare-up. However, if there's one thing we know for sure about MS, it's that this disease can strike at any age. So don't be surprised when, just as you're starting to feel better, you're suddenly struck down by a new attack!


What Is Multiple Sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of myelin sheaths covering nerve fibers in the brain, spinal cord, optic nerves, eyes, legs and arms. These protective sheath cells provide information that helps control muscle movement. But if these sheath cells become damaged, MS results. It affects 1 in every 68 people in the United States, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. A person with MS has two types of immune system cells in their body—T-cells and B-cells. T-cells help fight infection and B-cells help fight cancer. Each type of cell plays an important role in controlling the disease process. For example, T-cell activity controls how quickly the immune system responds to the virus that causes MS. And B-cells play a big part in controlling the degree of damage caused by MS. T-cells generally produce antibodies against proteins on abnormal white blood cells called macrophages that normally destroy infected tissues. These antibodies then spread throughout the body and stop the destruction of healthy tissue. B-cells also target abnormal white blood cells called monocytes, which are present in large numbers in the bloodstream. Monocytes act like white blood cells but do not have the same ability to kill invading pathogens. Many researchers believe that because B-cells do not kill the monocytes, the immune response becomes uncontrolled and spreads throughout the body. This leads to more severe symptoms. Because MS affects so many parts of the body, it often begins in the same area where it begins—the brain or spine. If the initial attack does not begin near the brain or spinal cord, it can progress to other areas over time. In most cases, the cause of MS remains unknown until the disease progresses to its worst stage. This stage consists of paralysis, cognitive problems, loss of vision, hearing or pain. MS can occur on its own, in conjunction with other neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's","The symptoms of MS can take months or years before you experience improvement. Your doctor can help determine when to expect full recovery by discussing the types and severity of your symptoms, their duration, and whether they are improving with treatment (see ""How can my doctor predict how well my MS is progressing?""). It may be necessary for you to stay in an MS-related care facility as long as a year or two after the initial diagnosis if you have ongoing problems or complications (for example, weakness on one side of the body that does not respond to medication, persistent neurological symptoms such as numbness or tingling in your arms and legs).

Q: What's involved in treating multiple sclerosis?\nA: A combination of medicines called interferon, glatiramer acetate and/or methylprednisolone is used to treat MS. These medications affect the immune system and can cause serious side effects. If you've been treated recently with these medications and still have signs and symptoms of MS, it's important for you to tell your doctor about any new symptoms. Your doctor will try to adjust the medications to avoid causing further damage and help minimize any other potential causes of your symptoms.

Q: Do all people who have MS need this type of medicine?\nA: All people diagnosed with MS should get preventive treatment. This means taking medicine to protect against the development of MS. For some people, this means vitamin E supplements or taking immunoglobulin. In most cases, however, preventive treatments include taking interferon (finasteride) and other drugs called biologics. Biologics suppress the production of certain proteins which can trigger the development of MS. Certain blood tests also can be done to check for early signs of MS, including brain lesions, vision changes or hearing loss.

If You Have Any Questions About Multiple Sclerosis \N


Ask your doctor or healthcare provider for more information about MS and other conditions that may make your condition worse or lead to complications.","By now, it is too late for you to have any meaningful improvement in your MS symptoms. It takes at least 12 months of daily therapy and other treatments until the disease progresses and causes signs or symptoms that are significant enough to be considered a disability. This time frame includes treatment with medications like Tysabri (etanercept), which may provide some relief from some types of MS-related symptoms such as numbness/tingling, muscle weakness, spasticity and cognitive problems.

There is more information on MS treatment from MS Treatment Guide.","The treatment for MS is not an overnight cure.

The medications that are prescribed after a relapse of MS will help slow down or stop the progression of your symptoms and get you back on track toward a normal life.

With time, you may be able to return to work or other activities where you previously enjoyed success. However, it may take several months before your symptoms improve enough so that you can resume your previous level of functioning.

It should also be noted that if you have other chronic illnesses such as diabetes or heart disease, this process can take longer because of additional complications and challenges involved in managing both conditions at once.

Q: How long does the course of MS last?\nA: There is no set time frame for how long MS stays in remission – all depends upon individual body chemistry. But research has shown that between 4-7 years following the initial diagnosis, there is significant improvement in many people who experience relapses. Most studies show that by age 50 years, the rate of relapse has declined significantly among those affected by MS.

When the first signs of MS arise, a person experiencing a relapse will typically experience fatigue, loss of appetite, memory problems, dizziness, headaches, weakness and muscle pain. At times, these symptoms may appear immediately following a relapse, but they usually fade over time. These symptoms do not necessarily indicate that another relapse is imminent. You may still experience some of the same symptoms when you first develop symptoms. This is what makes them difficult to predict!

Q: What type of treatments exist now for MS?\nA: Multiple sclerosis has three main forms: progressive (or active), secondary (or dormant) and remitting (or dormant). Progressive MS is characterized by gradual decline in cognitive ability over years. For example, one day someone may be completely blind from MS and then slowly begin to regain vision over time. A second person may become paralyzed due to MS in his/her 20s; the paralysis may progressively worsen over time. Finally, a third person who has had MS for decades may have little chance of developing full disability until their 80s. Secondary MS is characterized by rapid onset of symptoms followed by gradual worsening in function. In contrast, patients with latent (or delayed) MS generally experience more severe disease than either primary or secondary MS patients. They exhibit less improvement over time and tend to progress at a much slower pace. Remittent MS occurs in only 1% of cases. It is characterized by sudden relapse of symptoms following periods of relatively"
95,Q: Reading problems in MS\nA:,"Can you provide more details?

A: There are no particular solutions for reading the MS\N files. The text is provided by the user and can be translated to other languages, if necessary (see [2]). Some of the information may also come from the MS\N file itself; see the ""Notes"" section below. The best way to read the MS\N files is simply to copy them into your own program and run it through your editor to edit them with the appropriate syntax. For example, here's an article from MS\n. It was created using Microsoft Word 9 but I'm sure that anyone who uses Word 10 or higher will find many useful features. You'll notice a couple of places where the MS\N file has some interesting words in it—like ""VIRUS"" and ""INVASION."" These are actually references to viruses on hard drives. If you look at the MS\N file carefully, you might notice that it contains some lines like this:

The information given below is taken from a number of different sources, so it should be considered as being incomplete and subject to change at any time. It may be helpful to refer to your teacher or school librarian for further help if you have questions about using MS\nA.

Reading Problems in MS\nA

1) ""How do I get my text into print?""

MS\nA contains features which can make printing easier than ever before. In addition to its various ways of displaying and copying texts, MS\nA provides the Print Preview function which allows you to preview what will appear on your computer screen when you print your document. You can also add text to an existing file, thereby allowing you to print just the parts that interest you. The ability to import text files from other programs helps students understand how to format their work, and it allows them to save and edit documents. Students who need assistance with this should ask their instructor or school librarian for help.

2) ""I'm trying to copy someone else's file and get all the formatting correct. Can I still use MS\nA?""

Yes! Most people who want to print their work without having to worry about all the details, such as saving the original file format or changing the page layout, generally end up using Microsoft Word. MS Word does not contain the Print Preview feature, but many teachers and readers prefer Word over WordPad because it has more flexibility and capability. However, if you wish to print with Word, you must first create a new document (instructions), then convert it to Word format.

3) ""Can I read in MS\nA?""

Students who can read well should feel free to use MS\nA, even if they're learning the program for the first time. Some MS\nA users enjoy using MS\nA because of its unique look-and-feel. A few times a year, we'll hold a special event where students can share experiences with others while learning about MS\nA. If your class would like to attend one of these events, please contact us.","I'm just reading the words, not understanding what they mean. I don't understand why a character is saying the words and then doing some other action, or if there's even any meaning to the text at all! (this was done by the person who made the game, but he did it before you were even born)

A: This is one of the most common mistakes of students when learning to read. In English we do have two things that help us learn about a word's meaning. We know how it sounds as well as the context in which it has been used. A player can think back on what they have seen and heard of characters. They will generally remember many more details from one encounter than they will from another! The second thing we try to learn is the relationships between letters in words. We are taught that each letter represents a sound and therefore we also need to be able to identify the different sounds in the word. If someone starts typing an unfamiliar word with one of these letters it means that they cannot hear the difference between them. You should always use your left hand to type, but sometimes you may find yourself using both hands while playing games such as D&D or Magic the Gathering. This can lead to errors because the fingers tend to move closer together than normal and so it is harder for them to see the difference between letters.

The main cause of this error is that the student only knows a few letters. To correct it you must first become comfortable with a lot of new characters. Then, once you get familiar enough with those new characters, you can concentrate on learning the rest of the word. It took me several sessions to learn how to type correctly.

Here is a list of some commonly learned letters and their meanings. Notice that it does NOT include diacritics - the small dots at the end of the letters.

Solution 2 (Windows 7): This solution works on Windows 10 and Windows 8/8.1, but you need to be aware that this may not work with older versions of Windows like Vista, XP or 2000. The reason for this is the way how the game handles a crash dump file. When trying to run the game, it will first try to create one by using the DLLs in %SystemRoot%\.dmp. However, if the program crashes at any point during creating a crash dump, it'll then start looking for the main executable (.exe) file from which the problem occurred. So, for example, if your application crashes at some point, it might still use the DLLs located inside of C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\, even though the actual crash dump was made by another process. So, as long as both processes are running at the same time, the game will start searching for an application-specific location and generate a crash dump. You can test for this behavior by opening a Command Prompt window and entering the following command: wmic product where 'Product' starts with ""Microsoft® DirectX"". For example, to see what happens when crashing with Microsoft Visual Studio 2012, type Wmic Product Where 'VSTS2012' starts with ""Visual Studio 2012"". If you have a 64-bit version of Windows, you will also get errors about having more than two compatible 32-bit applications installed. To fix this issue, uninstall all 32-bit DirectX 9-based programs (such as msvcrt.dll ) installed via your Software Licensing Service Center. Note that you do not need to restart the computer after uninstalling those dlls. Also note that when reinstalling these files, make sure that they're placed under the same folder that they were originally installed in! Finally, to fix the path issues, download and install the free 3rd party tool 'DxDiag64' from here: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=4ABF-24FE&DisplayLang=en_US.

Re: Please fill out my juggling survey once again!


I think what makes this so great is how much detail there is about your routines, not only in general terms (including any special requirements you may have), but also specifically for each type of routine.


It's great to see such detailed information about your own stuff too - it would be impossible without all the comments I get back!

S: There are two main ways, depending on how much information you need and how quickly you can get there. One is that one reads the problem and then solves it, as described above. The other is to look at the solutions posted by others who solved the same problems. Try both and see which one you prefer (there isn't necessarily a right or wrong answer). If either solution is too hard, don't bother with it--try another one. If the solutions seem easy, then don't worry about it, because it's probably just the algorithm.

96,Q: most efficient and sustainable diets\nA:,"vegan

Q. How do you feel about the current state of science in this area?


It's a very interesting time right now because there are some great scientists working on these questions, but they're often not able to publish their results due to funding cuts or other things that make it harder for them to get their research out into the world. So I think this is an exciting time where a lot more people will be getting involved, and hopefully we'll start seeing new discoveries soon!

Q. Do you have any advice for someone who is considering doing a vegan diet?


The best thing would be to talk with a good nutritionist. You can find one at your local health food store. If you want to eat healthy foods like vegetables, fruits and whole grains, then it helps if you know what those nutrients are, so that you can balance the food that you put on your plate. But if you don't know how much protein you should be eating—for instance, if you're going vegetarian for ethical reasons—then just learn about the different types of proteins that are found in plant-based foods (like beans). Try to consume as many vegetables and fruits as possible each day, especially when you're getting ready for bed. If you add vegetables and fruit together, you end up consuming fewer calories overall, which makes sense because plants naturally contain lots of water, fiber and vitamins and minerals, so this is really important for weight control.

If you've got any other dietary tips you'd like to share please leave us a comment below!","the US Food Pyramid.

2nd-place winning diet

This is a low fat, high fiber vegetarian diet with an emphasis on fresh fruit and vegetables. It also contains a variety of legumes, grains, nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils.


The primary goals are to reduce total caloric intake (1,700 calories per day) and body weight (13 pounds). The other goals include increasing exercise frequency, improving micronutrient status, reducing stress levels, avoiding alcohol and tobacco use, eating less meat and dairy, and limiting consumption of animal products, in order to maximize health benefits for participants.

3rd place winning diet

In this diet, individuals would reduce their daily calorie intake to 1,000 calories per day and increase physical activity by 50 percent (or 30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise 3 times per week). The goal would be to achieve a healthy BMI, as well as a healthy blood pressure, cholesterol level, and blood sugar profile; maintain a good dietary pattern consisting of whole foods rich in plant foods; avoid sugars; limit saturated fats and trans fats, while maintaining adequate protein; and obtain adequate vitamin B12.

4th place winning diet

These diets are very similar to the first two but focus more heavily on fruit and vegetables. They contain about 100 to 150 grams of fruits and vegetables each day (depending on the person's needs), and a minimum amount of lean meats (a little over 2 ounces per day). Participants would also eat at least 15 percent extra of plants per day, including leafy greens such as spinach, kale, collard greens, bok choy, mustard greens, celery, broccoli, watercress, etc.

5th place winning diet

Many people who participate in these diets have trouble losing weight or keeping it off after they start. In contrast, many successful people on these diets say that if they had not followed them they would not be where they are today. However, those following these diets generally need to follow these diets for several years before achieving a sustained weight loss.

Why do some diets work and others don't?

The reason that certain diets seem to work better than others has nothing to do with how much you consume of the specific food group. There is no single recipe for success. Rather, it comes down to the type of diet you're trying to change your lifestyle and habits around. If you want to lose weight then try a low carb diet, or one that emphasizes whole foods instead of","vegan diet.

Q: how do you prepare your food? A: I just add a bit of water, salt, and sugar to it in the morning. Once I start working out, I eat more often (maybe once every two hours). The reason why is because the protein content of my meals are usually higher than the usual eating habits of people who are not physically active. So that they can gain weight without feeling tired afterwards or even hungry during their workouts.

What kind of training schedule would you recommend for someone interested in bodybuilding? A: I like to keep everything short, intense, and focused. When I am at home, I am always sleeping about 6-8hrs per day with 5-6hrs breaks in between. However, if I'm on stage I need longer breaks: from 2-3hr per day before going onstage to 4-5hrs per night afterwards.

How much exercise do you do per week? A: This depends entirely on me. During the offseason when I work out less, I train 3 times per week and during competitions only 1 time per month. But during the season, I try to get up at least 7-10hrs per day!

Do you use any supplements in your diet? A: I don't use any supplements other than water, salt, sugar and protein powder.

How many days off per week do you have? A: Usually during summer season I go down to 1 week off but sometimes I stay at 2 weeks. In winter season there's usually no downtime at all.

Can you give us a personal example of an important achievement that you achieved this year? What was the motivation behind it? A: Being able to become one of the first ever female winner at Mr Olympia 2017. That's definitely one of the biggest achievements of my life so far.

What are your goals for 2016? A: To continue growing as a Bodybuilder, compete against the best athletes around the world in various categories including Powerlifting, Weightlifting and Olympic Lifting. Continue getting stronger, faster and more muscular so that I will be capable of winning World Championships in different sports such as powerlifting and weightlifting.

If you could pick one thing from your past to change what it is, what would it be? A: My biggest regret has been to not continue competing in weightlifting after my Junior Olympics career ended due to bad health reasons. So it really hurts to think about what might've happened if I","the diet that is best for health and long term survival (not necessarily healthy).

I have not read any research on this topic, but it seems plausible to me. It may be that a diet of raw vegetables and fruit/veggies and little meat would be less stressful than one with lots of processed food and meat. That's why I am not in favor of vegetarianism. However, if you really think it will make your life better and more stress free, go ahead and try it. You'll need to do some research and decide what kind of foods work for you. But be prepared to eat a lot of vegetables and fruits, as many of them are high fiber, low calorie, nutritious and delicious foods. Many people don't like eating vegetables because they feel dirty or disgusting when eaten raw. I haven't tried raw carrots myself, but my husband does quite well. If you're worried about losing weight, then you should probably just switch from grains, potatoes and pasta to more wholesome whole plant based sources, such as green beans, kale, broccoli etc., rather than eating meat. I also recommend avoiding dairy products completely, unless you happen to be lactose intolerant, which is rare in North America.","diet-based

1) The most eco-friendly way to eat is to eat lots of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts and seeds. Most foods are better than just meat or dairy products in this regard. In fact, vegetarians are healthier and live longer than their omnivorous counterparts.

2) Meat is also a huge source of fat (about 90%), so it's important that we avoid the saturated fats that come from animals. Instead, choose plant oils like canola, corn, safflower, etc., which provide more healthy omega-3 fatty acids. These omega-3s help fight inflammation while lowering cholesterol and triglycerides. Eating these oils also helps lower blood pressure, reduce risk for heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and prevent obesity.


A recent study showed that even the best vegetarian diet could not save us if we ate more animal products than we needed because our body would just convert them into cholesterol anyway. So eating more plants may actually make us less healthy by raising our intake of harmful omega-6 fats.


Bottom Line: Plant-Based Diets Are More Nutritious Than Animal-Based Diets

As you saw above, there are many factors that influence your health and well being — including age, sex, socioeconomic status, exercise level, stress levels, lifestyle choices, genetic makeup, and genes. This means that different people will be affected differently by changing their nutrition and getting enough fiber. But all of those variables need to balance each other out in order to get optimal results.

If you're interested in trying a vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, raw food, or low carb lifestyle, here's my guide to what you should know about making good decisions on how to go veg.","I'm not sure if this is the best question.

As a general rule, I eat more meat than people in New Zealand who eat more vegetables. This has to do with a number of factors (not least because most Kiwis like their steak cooked rare). But I think it's worth noting that I consume more dairy than the average American.

I don't have any specific guidelines for how much protein or fat I should be eating per day – my own body weight fluctuates a lot so I can get away with a bit more milk. But I am pretty strict on carb intake, so about 20-30g/day of starch/breads and starches. The rest goes into fruit and veggie juices.","The optimal diet to meet the needs of all people.

1. Protein intake is more important for achieving good health than any other macronutrient (e.g., fat, carbohydrate) or its ratio (e.g., 0.8).2

2. Animal products are essential in a balanced diet (at least 50% of calories from protein).3

3. Fish are excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids that reduce inflammation, promote healthy skin, heart and brain function and increase energy production.4

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) recommends that Americans eat foods with high dietary fiber levels; select whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, soybeans, nuts, seeds, fish, low-fat dairy, poultry and meat; limit added sugars, processed meats and sweets and minimize saturated fat and trans fats.5

According to the DGA, one serving of seafood contains 18 percent to 23 percent of daily recommended value of EPA+DHA compared to 9 percent to 15 percent of a similar serving of chicken or beef.6

Although the DGA does not specifically recommend specific amounts of animal proteins, it does suggest eating at least 20 grams per day of lean red meat (liver, kidney or brisket), 14 grams per day of poultry and 21 grams per day of eggs.7

Consuming an adequate amount of protein for growth has been shown by both human nutrition studies and laboratory animals to improve muscle mass, strength and balance; prevent bone loss, osteoporosis and cancer; decrease risk of heart disease, stroke and Type 2 diabetes; improve immunity, cognitive performance and mood; control blood sugar; and improve immune function.8

Because high consumption of animal protein increases IGF-I, which in turn stimulates growth hormone release, increased body weight may be experienced over time, especially when protein intake is low.9 In addition, high protein intake may stimulate appetite while reducing satiety, increasing food intake, leading to overeating.10

While animal protein may be beneficial for building muscle mass and improving metabolism, it can also lead to chronic diseases such as obesity, hypertension, heart disease, and some forms of cancer.11 High intakes of animal protein have been linked to higher risks of type 2 diabetes,12 prostate cancer13 and certain types of colon cancer14 among others.15 For these reasons, a variety of plant-based proteins are often used instead of animal proteins in many diets including vegetarian, vegan, lacto-ovo vegetarians, p","I don't see it that way. I think there's a lot of evidence now pointing to the fact that what we eat has an impact on our health, in terms of whether or not we have diabetes, obesity, heart disease, cancer -- all these things are linked with food choices, especially as people get older.

Q: What is your diet like?

A: I'm very vegetarian (laughs). It's about 80/20 vegetarianism. That means 20% is meat-based food and 80% is plant-based food. And I try to be mindful enough to know if it's okay to take a bite out of a steak here and there because it's just so good for me. But you know when you're trying to find healthy foods at home, there are no rules whatsoever. If something isn't bad for you, then go ahead and eat it.

Q: How does vegetarianism affect your performance as a quarterback?

A: For me personally, this past year was one where I really didn't care much about anything else. I was focused on being able to function. When you can do that -- physically, mentally, emotionally -- then other stuff doesn't matter. So my mindset changed from 'What am I doing? Should I even be playing?' To 'Okay, I can still play.' In many ways, it's just more relaxing. You've got nothing else on your mind except football.

Q: Do you think your success comes down to your mental toughness?

A: I think it definitely plays into it. The thing is, it takes time to develop those habits. There's definitely a learning curve. So there were times last season where I felt pretty fatigued. There were some games where I wasn't as sharp. I'd go out there and realize how tired I was, but the next day I wouldn't feel that way. It would be back to normal the following week. So it took time for me to become comfortable with that.","a diet with sufficient nutrients to meet the needs of all age groups, including babies \xA: foods that are high in fiber (for example, fruits, vegetables)\xA: foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA), which have been found to improve cardiovascular health in studies.

Q. What are the effects of exercise on mental and social well-being? A. Exercise helps improve mental health; improves self-esteem and mood; reduces anxiety and depression; promotes an active lifestyle that can reduce stress; decreases the risk for heart disease and certain types of cancer; increases brain volume; provides a sense of accomplishment; boosts academic performance; relieves pain and inflammation in joints, muscles and other body tissues; increases energy levels; and lowers blood pressure. These benefits may be achieved without any negative side effects or harmful long-term consequences, such as weight gain or chronic fatigue.

Abstract\r


""The objective of this study was to assess the benefits and risks associated with physical activity during pregnancy, based on available evidence in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. Data from 12 RCTs were included; all were published between 1991 and 2010. Meta-analyses demonstrated that moderate exercise performed for 30 min/day or more significantly reduced the risk of preeclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), while performing less than 60 min/day was not effective at reducing these conditions. The results also showed a dose response relation, indicating that greater amounts of exercise are associated with lower rates of adverse outcomes such as preterm birth, neonatal hypertension, low Apgar score (<4), and cesarean section.""

Exercise can prevent complications of pregnancy - by exercising you can reduce your chances of having problems with childbirth, so you should get active! It's worth noting that physical training before becoming pregnant is still advised, but not recommended after pregnancy due to potential differences in intensity and duration of contractions.


If you are going into labour, make sure you do not try to push too hard because if you don't take it easy after giving birth, you could end up damaging your baby and yourself even further if they go past their head first, or if you attempt to give them CPR, you could be risking them dying, not to mention that you will be putting yourself through something that will likely cause pain and discomfort in the most crucial time of life in the process. So...don't overdo it!


I recommend doing some form of aerobic exercise whenever you have the chance to. I would say this includes walking, cycling, running and swimming, although there are many other ways you can go about getting exercise. If you feel like you need extra help then start working out with weights, yoga, pilates etc. Just remember that when pushing through labor, nothing feels better than being able to push against gravity for just a little bit longer!","physical activities have many health benefits, including improved cardiovascular and respiratory health; increased mobility and independence for older adults. Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (PEG) recommends that most adults get 30 minutes or more of moderate-intensity aerobic activity on at least two days a week.

BODY WEIGHT: Body weight is the measure of how much an individual weighs. The body mass index (BMI), which can be calculated from height and weight, is used to assess obesity in people who are overweight. BMI ranges from 20 to 25. A healthy range for men is 18.5 to 24.9 and 21.1 to 24.6 for women. Obesity is defined as having a BMI of 30 or higher for a person's age and gender.

EATING CONDITIONS: People with diabetes are at increased risk for developing heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, and kidney problems. Other conditions associated with obesity include gallstones, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, and certain cancers.

DIABETES: Diabetes affects 1 in 4 American adults. When diagnosed early enough, the condition can often be managed successfully. But if it's not caught soon, diabetes can cause severe damage to both your kidneys and heart. About 15 percent of adults with type 2 diabetes will develop complications such as kidney failure within 10 years of being diagnosed. This means that you may need treatment with dialysis to keep your kidneys working properly. Your doctor can help find out if you're at risk and whether you should undergo dialysis.

MUSCLE PROBLEMS: Weight gain during adulthood can lead to a variety of muscle injuries, including those that occur when muscles stretch too much or break down because of changes in your diet or exercise habits. These injuries can lead to pain, discomfort, and even permanent disability.

WOMEN WITH CHOLESTIC DISEASE (CHD): Cholestasis occurs when bacteria builds up in the digestive tract and can block digestion. Cholestasis can happen to anyone at any time, but it becomes particularly dangerous for people with Type 2 diabetes and premenopausal women who already have high cholesterol levels, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. If you have cholestasis, there is no cure but lifestyle changes like reducing intake of solid fats and increasing fiber intake can improve symptoms.

- Physical activity may be useful in preventing certain types of cancer, diabetes and heart disease. The American Heart Association (AHA) has suggested that up to 30 minutes a day of moderate physical activity might prevent 1,600 deaths due to coronary artery disease each year. \r

- Regular exercise can also help people lose weight; however, not all overweight people need to participate regularly. \r

- It's important to get sufficient exercise as often as you can to keep your body fit. If you're already physically active, there are several ways to stay healthy. They include staying physically active throughout the week, getting at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week. These activities should not interfere with your work responsibilities and provide adequate time alone.\r

- Avoiding tobacco use. Smoking damages your cardiovascular system and increases the risk of a number of serious health conditions, such as stroke, lung cancer, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. Cigarette smoking is also linked to many other diseases and diseases that cause premature death. For more information on this topic see the CDC's website. \r

- Exercise regularly to avoid injury. This includes walking around at low speeds, climbing stairs if possible, working out by using resistance bands, and lifting weights. \r

- Preventing obesity \r

- Reduce the chance of becoming obese by eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein and healthy fat sources. Some good choices are fish, poultry, nuts, olives, avocados, olive oil, chicken and turkey breast, salmon, cheese, yogurt, beans and peas, eggs, whole grain breads, brown rice, dried fruit and dark green leafy vegetables. \r

- Avoiding sedentary behavior \r

The main goal of exercise is to burn calories. You want to burn enough calories so that when you do sit down for a meal, it will not make you hungry again. A high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet helps you reach your calorie goals. Exercising doesn't mean that you need to eat large amounts of food to achieve your workout goal.\r

This review found that aerobic exercise was associated with beneficial effects on the following health outcomes: body weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease.

""Virtually every single study showed that regular exercise reduces the risk for some type of chronic condition,"" said lead author Dr. Richard J. Smith, an associate professor of clinical medicine at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, in a statement. ""However, one area we need to take note of is whether people who are not physically active can benefit from physical activity.""


The researchers evaluated the data from five observational studies conducted between 1985 and 2012. One of these studies included more than 14,000 individuals over age 50; the other four included about 16,500 subjects. Participants were classified as either inactive or actively engaged in aerobic activities based upon their self-reported frequency and intensity of their weekly exercise participation.

Researchers then compared each group's health status using 12 different measures, including weight, waist circumference (a measure of abdominal fat), blood pressure, and serum lipids. They also examined factors like smoking history, alcohol consumption, physical activity level, and education level.

After adjusting for all potential confounding factors, the team discovered that aerobic exercise provided the greatest protection against several chronic conditions. Specifically, aerobic exercise was significantly protective for obesity, elevated blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancer.


There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of death from any cause after controlling for factors such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, family history of cardiovascular diseases, and lifestyle habits like smoking status. However, there were differences by region—the United States had the highest rate of death from all causes, while the Netherlands had the lowest rate.


It should be noted that the researchers did find that moderate exercise training resulted in higher life expectancy. That being said, this doesn't necessarily mean that everyone needs to do it. As the researchers point out in their paper: ""For example, although vigorous activity is often recommended for older adults with cardiovascular disease, the evidence linking exercise to improved survival rates among frail persons has been inconsistent.""

Dr. Michael Blaha, director of medical informatics at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, told CNBC that the findings may provide new guidelines for physicians when they prescribe exercise therapy to patients.

""[W]e know from our own work [that] if someone comes in and says they have","health benefits of regular exercise. B, C, and D indicate the percentages that are statistically significant at P < 0.05 for each variable. The bars in (A) show the 95% confidence intervals for each outcome variable.

Table 3 shows how the results change when we include other covariates. We included gender as a continuous predictor because women tend to be more active than men. In addition, we added age to the model to allow us to test whether any effects of physical activity on the incidence of heart failure are dependent upon sex or age alone. Finally, we included socioeconomic status as an additional covariate. We found that none of our variables significantly predicted the risk of having heart failure; however, we did find an association between BMI and increased risk of heart failure. Specifically, we found that overweight people had about twice the risk of having heart failure as normal weight people. This relationship held even after controlling for sex, education, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. These findings suggest that obesity may lead to heart failure through a process known as dyslipidemia, which is characterized by elevated blood pressure and cholesterol levels. It has been suggested that dyslipidemia may also increase risk factors such as high blood pressure and low HDL.25-27 Thus, this study suggests that there exists a positive correlation between obesity and heart failure independent of other risk factors.

We next investigated the effect of physical activity on heart failure by using the Cardiovascular Risk Factor Surveillance System (CRFS).28 The CRFS is designed to monitor disease occurrence among US adults with risk factors for cardiovascular disease.29 Because of its design, it is possible that individuals who have heart failure will not participate in regular clinical examinations. However, they do undergo extensive clinical evaluations during routine medical visits. As such, we were able to obtain information from CRFS about the prevalence of physical activity. Using these data, we estimated that in 2002, 19.1% of all American adults reported participating in some form of moderate-to-vigorous leisure time physical activity (defined as ""some"" physical activities ≥15 minutes per week).30 These participants were followed for 1 year before being followed for 2 years following their heart failure diagnosis. Table 4 presents the adjusted HRs associated with participation in any type of leisure time physical activity.

98,Q: most common complications in pregnancy\nA:,"miscarriage.

3. Q: how often is a pregnancy confirmed? A: approximately 20% of pregnancies are known to be spontaneous, whereas around 60% are associated with fertilization. Approximately 50% of the total number of pregnancies (20%) will not be confirmed; these cases are usually referred to as ""false positives"". In addition, between 10 and 30% of all women are estimated to miscarry during their pregnancy and about 3-5% of women die.

4. Q: what happens if a woman miscarries while she has an ectopic pregnancy?

a. If there was no uterine atony or severe pain during a normal menstrual period after the endometrial lining began to disappear, then it can occur on its own without any further cause for concern. The ovaries may have become blocked, so the embryo may still be developing within the uterus. Some experts believe that a condition called endometriosis may contribute to this outcome. However, other specialists do not agree on whether endometriosis plays a role. b. If endometriosis has affected your uterine lining, then you should see your doctor for treatment immediately. c. If endometriosis has already occurred but cannot be removed through surgery, your doctor may perform laparoscopy to remove the tissue which is causing the blockage. This procedure can also result in scarring. d. For most women who develop a miscarriage, the loss occurs quickly following implantation. e. Occasionally, when fertilized eggs fail to complete development, a miscarriage may take place much later in the process. It is important to note that most abortions result from failure to reach the stage where the embryo implants and begins growing inside the womb. Therefore, even though some women experience a partial abortion of a pregnancy, the majority would actually be considered full term abortions since they would continue to develop normally after delivery. f. Some doctors believe that miscarriage is caused by something called a ""fibroid"" - small tumors found throughout the body which prevent the formation of blood vessels necessary for the growth of embryos. These tumors can sometimes grow so large that they obstruct the reproductive system altogether. There is currently no way to know if you are pregnant with fibroids before you begin taking birth control pills. G. When does pregnancy start? A. At the time of conception, sperm meets egg, forming a single cell called a zygote. This cell divides many times to form several hundred cells called blastocysts, each of which contains four million nuclei","hemorrhage

Q: which medications should be used during labor and delivery?A: oral or injectable anti-seizure medication such as Depakote, phenytoin, carbamazepine. Also try an antiseptic.


Q: what is the best time to give birth when breastfeeding can be avoided?A: before 36 weeks gestation. This will allow enough milk supply for both mother and baby. If you are going into labour at 39 weeks, it may not work well to keep your baby on breast milk until after 34 weeks. You could also use a formula with more protein. This should be made with cow's milk and can be given either by bottle, syringe or pump. It is important that a woman uses only this product if there are no complications or any signs of infection. Your health care provider may recommend using another type if other products do not help.


Q: is it safe to deliver my baby early because I am breastfeeding?A: Yes, it is possible. When the uterus has grown and the cervix has been dilated, the baby's head is now inside the pelvis. The muscles of the pelvic floor contract and push the baby down and out of the vagina. Babies born early often have short vaginal births, but they usually stay intact (unborn). In fact, early babies who are delivered early have less perineal trauma than later deliveries (Crowell 1990). Early pregnancies tend to be lighter and easier to get through because of their shorter duration. They tend to end sooner too so are more likely to be born at home. As the size of a baby grows, he/she tends to become heavier and move around more. Early delivery allows you to deliver the right sized baby without risk of serious problems to the mommy or baby.","ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, ectopic rupture of membranes, placenta previa.

Q: what are the symptoms?\nA: bleeding, abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting or constipation; high blood pressure. Q: can you tell me more about how to tell if it's an ectopic pregnancy?\nA: most commonly, it is diagnosed by ultrasound examination (which shows a tube resembling an egg). In cases where other tests show that the embryo has already formed inside the uterus, a fetal echocardiogram may be helpful in determining the type of pregnancy. If your health care provider suspects that the pregnancy is ectopic, he or she may prescribe medicines such as folic acid, iron-containing supplements (including vitamin B12), and antibiotics. For many women with chronic infection, medications such as doxycycline, clindamycin, moxifloxacin, tetracyclines, and erythromycin are prescribed for one or all of their children. A woman who takes an antibiotic to treat her bacterial vaginosis will be able to become pregnant again without having to take oral contraceptives while taking this medication. Q: which prenatal tests should I get?\nA: You'll want to have an ultrasound scan at least three weeks before you start trying to conceive so that the baby's heart rate, breathing pattern, and blood chemistry can be monitored during the first week of life. If you're not sure whether the test was positive or negative, ask your healthcare provider. It's best to wait until after the test for the results but even then they may only indicate that there is no danger of the baby's developing serious illness. The next step involves getting pregnant. Because some babies are born preterm, early interventions may be necessary to help ensure the health of both mother and child. Q: does my body need vitamins or minerals from food?\nA: Yes, pregnant women often require dietary supplements containing folate, calcium, zinc, and copper. These nutrients help increase the amount of red blood cells and oxygenated blood, allowing more oxygen to reach the fetus' brain and muscles. Foods rich in iron include beef and chicken; nuts and vegetables contain iron as well; legumes and soybeans contain iron; whole grains generally provide iron, although barley and rye may also offer significant amounts; fish is high in iron. Some foods rich in protein, including eggs, milk, yogurt, and cheese, also contain iron. Q: do I need to","IUDs have a high failure rate, and there is no cure for endometriosis. Most women with severe pain will want to stop taking the IUD (or the pill) before their period starts. It may take 3-4 weeks of treatment before you are able to get pregnant again. There's an option for emergency contraception that can be used immediately after unprotected sex; however, this is not recommended at this time as it does not work as well when taken within 2 days after unprotected sex.

Q: how do I know if my doctor has been through pelvic exams?

A: doctors should discuss your symptoms with their OBGYN prior to examining you. If you notice any abnormal discharge from or a change in the size or shape of a lump on your lower belly/waist, you should see your gynecologist. This could mean that something is wrong with your uterus (endometrium), ovaries, cervix, or fallopian tubes. It may also indicate an ectopic pregnancy, which is a condition where an embryo implants outside the uterus but grows into a baby without needing to continue developing normally inside of it (called a fertilized egg). For more information about ectopic pregnancies, please visit our Endometrial Health page.

Q: what else would cause me to have pain during intercourse?

A: Pain during sex occurs in up to 6% of women who are using hormonal birth control pills and is usually caused by either bleeding or spotting while you're having intercourse. You may feel cramping, burning, or pressure throughout your pelvis, and your partner may experience pain.

If you suspect that your partner might have had vaginal irritation due to using hormonal contraceptives, check out this article for tips to minimize discomfort while sex: Does Oral Contraception Cause Vaginal Irritation?, and speak with your doctor about whether you'd like to switch to an alternative method of birth control.

Treatment for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease

The first step to treating pelvic inflammatory disease is understanding its causes. Unfortunately, even though research shows that some forms of infertility can be directly linked to endometriosis, many patients don't understand how endometriosis affects fertility. In addition, some people are afraid of the idea of undergoing surgery to remove the uterus and then seeing the scarring and damage done in the future. That's why we offer several options for treatment of pelvic inflammation, including:

However, there is a small possibility that an IUD can lead to an infection (pelvic inflammatory disease). This could be due to the device itself or due to other factors like the woman's health history, stress levels, medication use and certain medications, such as aspirin, blood thinners, anticoagulants, HIV medications, and antimalarials. Also women with diabetes may have a higher rate of infection with TSS (toxic shock syndrome).

How should I insert my copper IUD?

Insertion does not occur by yourself - it requires two doctors' visits. The first visit happens before you leave for work or school, and lasts 45 minutes. During this time, your doctor will examine your cervix and uterus and check if any changes need to be made during the procedure. If you're having an IUD inserted at home, you'll need two more visits after you return home. Both of these visits last between 30-45 minutes each, and you'll be asked questions about symptoms during the visit to make sure you don't have anything else going on. You'll also receive instructions on how much, where and when to insert the IUD. The IUD must stay in place for 6 months to prevent expulsion, so it's important to follow all directions carefully.

Do not try to insert your IUD if you haven't had sex within 2 weeks of coming out of your period. Insertion can cause serious injury to the uterus.

If your partner has taken medications known to affect sperm, he or she should not get pregnant while using the Copper IUD.

What are some possible side effects of the Copper IUD?

The copper IUD should not cause birth defects or harm the unborn baby. Women who have never given birth should be careful about inserting an IUD. Any type of surgery, including cesarean delivery, is likely to be more dangerous than an IUD insertion. Some women experience breast tenderness during placement, but this usually goes away soon after insertion. Most women find no discomfort from their IUD. Occasionally, the uterine muscles contract around the IUD causing mild cramping and bleeding, sometimes leading to spotting and painless removal. In rare cases, it can cause pelvic infection or even scarring. A number of studies suggest that the IUD can reduce the risk of getting PID, which means an unintended pregnancy. It is difficult to","respiratory failure, hemorrhage and perforation of the uterus.

The overall mortality rate during pregnancy was 5% (5/13,000) for both groups. The incidence of major congenital malformations was significantly higher among infants born to women with anemia than those born to women without anemia (RR = 1.8; 95% CI:1.2–3.4). This study demonstrates that a high intake of iron supplements is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformation. More research is needed to determine whether this association remains after adjusting for maternal age or other factors known to influence fetal outcomes.","bleeding (15%), infection (9%)P&G did not respond to a request for comment.

Other adverse reactions reported by at least 1% of pregnant women are listed below: abnormal uterine bleeding, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, and placental abruption.""

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says that the risk of these other conditions is low, and they can be treated easily with medication. However, it notes that there are cases when more extensive treatment is necessary: ""These can include spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, fetal death and congenital abnormalities. It may also involve a life-threatening condition such as placenta previa or fetal macrosomia.""

In this case, the doctors say that there is no evidence that the baby has any abnormalities. The parents agree, saying that while their child's face looks different, she has been growing well since birth. They argue that the symptoms are similar to those caused by a disease called Guillain Barre Syndrome – which causes inflammation of the stomach and bowel. If her liver function does fail, then she will become dehydrated. ""She is doing fine,"" says the mother. ""When I first saw her, she had some sort of swelling on one side of her chest, but that was because she had been drinking so much water. She doesn't seem to have any problems like that now. We were told there are people who get high levels of fluoride from the water [in Poland] – and we are taking precautions to ensure our daughter won't end up with that.""

It is not clear if the children had been exposed to higher than normal levels of fluoride during their childhoods, or whether they drank bottled water instead of tap water. Poland has a strict fluoridation policy, where water companies must add extra fluoride into the supply every year in order to meet government standards. Most of the population drinks bottled water instead of tap water; only about 7 per cent rely on municipal water supplies for their primary source of drinking water.

What if I have my blood work done? Do I need to take corticosteroids before and after taking Lantus?

If you are prescribed a dose of Lantus for a non-traumatic condition, you do not need to stop treatment with your regular medicine as long as you continue to follow your doctor's directions. If you experience pain during or after the injection or if there is bleeding or bruising while taking Lantus, contact your healthcare provider immediately or go to an emergency room right away. However, you will likely be able to resume using your usual medications without stopping them. The same applies to people who were previously treated with steroids before starting therapy with Lantus. They should continue to follow their normal steroid dosage, but should use caution when taking extra doses of this medication.

Are there any side effects associated with Lantus?

Lantus does not cause any serious side effects like liver problems or cancer. These drugs may change how your body handles certain hormones (including those related to pregnancy), so you must tell your healthcare provider about any changes to your hormone levels.

If you stop taking Lantus, it could take several weeks for your symptoms to disappear completely. You will also probably feel slightly sick. Also, because most people start to gain weight around three months post-treatment, your weight may increase during the first week or two following your last dose of Lantus.

In addition, some people experienced nausea or stomach cramps. Some people experienced swelling of the hands and feet; however, this was generally milder than what would happen with chemotherapy. In rare cases, a person experiencing such events experienced an allergic reaction to Lantus. This occurred in one report of a 5-year-old child who received cyclophosphamide. No other reports of adverse reactions were reported among patients taking Lantus.

Should I get more tests prior to beginning my next cycle of chemotherapy?

Before beginning chemotherapy, make sure your doctor has confirmed all of the information on this page to ensure that your risk of getting cancer is minimized. Ask questions to determine whether further testing is needed. Your healthcare professional can help answer any questions you might have regarding these types of tests.

""This study is important because it confirms that a diet rich in vitamin C can protect against a variety of different diseases,"" said Dr. Frank Hu, an internist and nutrition professor at Stanford University School of Medicine who was not involved with the research. ""It's especially relevant to children because their immune systems are still developing.""","inflammation of the liver caused by too much alcoholA: a symptom of fibromyalgia. It usually begins 2 to 4 weeks after you have your first drink, although it can occur at any time during pregnancy. Symptoms include headaches and neck pain. They may also be accompanied by fatigue, nausea or vomiting, and abdominal cramps. When they are severe, they cause rapid weight loss and the inability to stand up straight for more than a few seconds. These symptoms often disappear within one week or two, but sometimes last several months. The only way to treat fibromyalgia is with medication, which must take place regularly throughout life to prevent its recurrence. A number of medications exist that may alleviate some of these symptoms. The drug cyclobenzaprine (Cytoxan) should always be used before alcohol because it blocks the action of acetaldehyde in your liver. Other drugs that may relieve the symptoms of fibromyalgia include the benzodiazepines diazepam (Valium), temazepam (Ativan), lorazepam (Ativan) and oxazepam (Soma).

Eating habits: alcohol, caffeine, tobacco, dieting


Coffee, tea and diet pills: Your doctor may recommend adding these things into your daily routine as part of treatment. These include caffeine, herbal teas such as St John's Wort, green coffee beans, cocoa powder, soy milk and chocolate. These will help to keep your blood sugar stable so that your body does not become dehydrated. You may feel less tired if you stop drinking coffee and tea and limit your intake of food containing caffeine. Avoid eating foods that contain carbohydrates like white bread, crackers and pastries. If you do eat them, make sure to add extra fiber and water. Drinking diet pills may help improve how well you sleep at night by increasing metabolism. However, diet pills are unlikely to change how many pounds you lose. Diet pills can also delay the onset of weight-loss surgery. Although this type of procedure involves removing excess fat from your abdomen, diet pills do not remove the calories you burn through exercise or physical activity. As mentioned above, cutting out these kinds of foods can make your fibromyalgia symptoms worse. Exercise is another important part of your treatment plan. Although there is no cure for fibromyalgia, certain exercises can be helpful to ease your symptoms. Walking on a treadmill increases the amount of oxygen in your blood. This helps to reduce muscle tension and lower stress levels. Exercises that","the blood vessels in the scalp and neck are swollen, resulting from blood flow from the brain.The swelling can become severe enough to break up some of the tiny blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood through the skin. This causes a headache, nausea, fatigue or numbness around your eyes and/or mouth.This may also be called ""headache of the head"" - especially if you have had headaches before but these usually come on slowly over time, with no pain, unlike the pain you might feel after having a migraine.*I don't know how this works, I'm not a neurologist and am just guessing. You need to tell your doctor about it, even though you think your headache is only due to stress or sleepless nights.It's true that when stress hormones (like cortisol) build up in the body, they cause inflammation. However, inflammation isn't what causes migraines. It's actually the buildup of proteins (called cytokines), such as interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, that trigger the symptoms.The immune system then produces chemicals called prostaglandins that block signals sent by the brain's electrical nerve cells, which tells the rest of the body what muscles to contract and where to move. If the prostaglandins aren't blocked, the nerves send messages that lead to headaches.There are two forms of migraine, primary (first symptom) and secondary (later symptoms). Primary migraine usually lasts less than 5 minutes, while secondary migraine could last for hours or days.*This problem affects primarily men between the ages of 20-50. Women are more likely to get it as well, but men are more apt to develop it.It appears to run in families, although most cases happen in people who were diagnosed at an early age.","bleeding of the lymph nodes

Caring for someone who has been treated with TAP is very similar to caring for any other cancer patient. These are some of the important things you should consider if you have a child under 16 years old:

Check your child's mouth, nose, ears and eyes for signs that he or she may be developing serious skin infections. Make sure they get medical help as soon as possible.

Ask a doctor about all medicines your child takes to make sure there isn't an allergy to anything in their medicine cabinet. It can take time to find out if you're allergic to something in a medicine; even after taking it for a while. If you notice symptoms from any medication your child takes, tell your doctor right away so they can check it before giving the medicine to your child.

If a child needs extra care while being treated by a doctor, do not hesitate to ask them what will happen to your child once the treatment is finished. If you believe your child is at risk of getting dangerous side effects, talk to your doctor about how long they should wait to see another doctor until your child is well enough to go home.

Talk to your child's doctor about whether the treatment schedule for treating a rare form of cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This form of cancer rarely occurs in children but requires special management and includes chemotherapy and radiotherapy. All children with ALL are considered high-risk and require regular follow-up visits by doctors to monitor their condition and treatments. In addition, many children receive bone marrow transplants (BMT), which can save lives when paired with aggressive chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Talk with your child's doctor about if BMT would benefit him or her. They'll decide how often these visits will be needed and whether you should continue to pay for the services until your child is ready to return home.","swollen lymph node on the left side

What about my physical exams?


The exam will be done by your doctor who may give you medication to help with any pain you are having or swelling. You might also be asked to use an ultrasound machine if they can't see inside your body. If there is any bleeding during the exam, it should stop right away and there shouldn't be a problem as long as the surgery goes well. The blood clot in your liver that was removed after the surgery won't return unless something else causes it to do so.

If the procedure went OK and you're still feeling a little bit sore or tired, then you could take some time off from work. This will usually depend on how bad the pain and swelling has gotten since you were discharged and how much you have been eating.

When should I see my healthcare provider?

1. A doctor will check your baby's health just before he gets his first vaccination so he doesn't need extra time to get used to it.

2. Your baby should start getting vaccinated as soon as possible after being born and continue on schedule until age 12 months, when he starts kindergarten. For some children, a second shot at 13-14 months would be needed. But once again, your pediatrician will advise you on what the best course of action is based on how sick your child is and whether the risk from the vaccine outweighs the benefits.

3. You must take your infant or toddler to the same health care professional each time she has been given a new vaccine. This ensures that there is no ""double dose"" effect and any adverse events are caught","they just are. They don't cause any damage. You should be able to find a place where it isn't hurting you.

Q: my neck hurts?A: this is usually a result of the cervical vertebrae not being in correct alignment. It's normal and will go away on its own. Your doctor may recommend X-rays to make sure it has fully healed.


Q: what is the best way to tell if I have an enlarged lymph node?A: the best way is when you can feel something sticking out of your body. The next time you have pain or numbness in one or both arms, legs, hands, feet or face (or anything else), you probably have an enlargement. If the sore, tender, painful area does not heal within 24 hours, see a doctor.


Q: what happens if I keep getting these types of pains?A: You must take extra care with anything that causes your muscles to tighten up. Try stretching more, do some deep breathing exercises, and drink lots of water. Have a friend massage you while you sleep so you don't get tired.


Q: Can I use cortisone during treatment?A: yes, but only for the first couple weeks after surgery. After two weeks, most patients experience relief from their symptoms. However, it must be used sparingly because it may leave you sterile due to immune system suppression.


Q: How long should I stay off steroids?A: Most people need no special attention. Just follow the instructions and you'll be fine. This includes steroids and hormones like estrogen and progesterone.


Q: Is there a catch to this surgery?A: No. There aren't any side effects other than inflammation.


Q: What happens to the rest of the lymphatic system once the cancer is gone?A: You might notice some mild fever that resolves on its own. The rest of your lymph nodes will still grow even after surgery, so keep an eye on them to ensure they're healthy. If you feel better quickly, then you might want to wait another week or two before going back on drugs. Remember, your immune system needs time to recover.


Q: What kind of support services exist for patients who have had this type of surgery?A: There are many programs available for you to help deal with your recovery. A good option would be having someone who knows about chemotherapy or radiation therapy come in and talk to you about all aspects of the procedure","I can't remember what the symptoms were. (7/10)

#8: a lot of patients have pain/shaking in their hands, feet and lower body.

A: This is a very common complaint among patients with LME. It's also called ""joint impingement"". The problem is usually caused by an over-stretching or over-tearing at the joints of the spine. If you look closely at your back and arms, you should see some small areas that are inflamed, tender to touch, red, swollen or painful. These are not necessarily your joints! You'll notice these signs if you sit or stand for long periods of time during treatment. This may be due to some other condition such as a headache, nausea, loss of appetite etc. or it could simply indicate a softening at the joint. When this happens, the patient will develop chronic pain along the affected area. We recommend regular physical therapy or stretching exercises along with appropriate medications to help relieve the inflammation. However, it's important to note that all pain and discomfort associated with LME is completely normal and expected. The symptoms do not occur because there's something wrong with the patient but rather they happen because of the stress placed on the muscles or nerves of the spine which results from a poor alignment of the spine during a lifetime of sitting or standing.


Lymph node changes after LME.

In many cases of low back pain, the initial injury was caused by a fall from a high place and so we would expect to find the same types of findings in patients who've had the experience of falling off a chair or ladder. Unfortunately most of us don't fall down often enough, or our parents didn't teach us how to make good use of ladders! In the case of LME, we found no significant difference between those patients whose falls occurred while they were seated and those who fell when they stood up. But, more recent studies suggest otherwise. As explained above, one study reported a higher incidence of LME in persons with a history of severe back pain compared to those without such an account.[1] Another study confirmed this finding. A retrospective analysis found that in 8 of 11 patients studied the fall happened before the onset of pain. Some researchers believe that since the injuries were often traumatic they trigger a response in the spinal cord of some sort which creates a hyperactive signal in the nerves that cause pain.[2] Again, this isn't true at all but rather just a theory based on","light, red flare (non-cancer)

Discussion

In this randomized crossover intervention study that assessed acute effects of high-dose nandrolone on measures of skin health, we found that chronic administration of nandrolone and its metabolites significantly reduced skin thickness and overall body composition in overweight men. Furthermore, our results suggest that increased circulating nandrolone levels might play a role in the maintenance of the changes induced by long-term consumption of nandrolone or its metabolite. This finding differs from those previously reported in nonobese subjects (27, 28), suggesting a direct link between these two compounds. However, more studies are needed to validate and elucidate this hypothesis. For example, there were significant differences between groups when participants' baseline weight was controlled (data not shown). Whether it is possible to reverse the negative effects of chronic overnutrition and obesity on skin function remains an important question. It may be prudent to administer nandrol","It's because you're not really being careful enough to keep your hands clean. Your skin is so sensitive that it can't handle the dryness of a shower for too long, and even if you do wash your hands after using the bathroom, there are other bacteria on your hand. I usually get my hands thoroughly rinsed with soap right before leaving the house (or at least make sure they're completely dried off) but some people like having their hands wet when taking a bath or shower...others may prefer to avoid germs altogether. If that makes sense.Q: Why does my hair feel greasy?A: When you first start out with shampooing your hair, it can take about 6 months for the oils in your scalp to start working properly again. At this point, it will probably look greasy until the new oil production is up to snuff. After about 3-4 weeks of getting use to your hair getting clean, you should see an improvement!Q: My hair feels coarse/thick - how does this happen??A: This can be caused by many things. The most common one is just trying out different shampoos and conditioners. Sometimes the only solution is to switch from a sulfate based conditioner to a less sulfated version. Another reason is maybe you have some sensitivity to certain ingredients in shampoos; however, most shampoos contain all the essential oils needed for healthy hair. Even though these oils might irritate your scalp, they won't cause problems unless you also suffer from very dry, flaky skin.Q: Is there anything that I can do to help my hair grow faster?A: There are tons of ways you can boost growth. One way to give your hair a little extra oomph is to put it into a ponytail. Try wearing a ponytail during the day and then tucking it into a bun overnight. You'll notice that after a few days you'll start seeing more growth. Also, washing your hair will help speed up its recovery time. Q: How often should I brush my hair?A: To maintain your cuticle health and prevent split ends, brushing your hair twice a week helps. For those who don't want to brush their hair, you can also try a quick heat treatment using a hairdryer or blowdryer. While this isn't guaranteed to help your curls grow faster, I've seen amazing results from using a combination of products such as Conditioner + Heat + Leave-In Treatment.

I've been having a lot of trouble finding bras that fit because they're too big/too small.. is this true? What do you think about bras that are too large? Are there any brands that fit well under 36DD?A: I don't know if this has been asked before, but since this question got more than 1,000 upvotes, let me try to answer it. If your bra size changes over time or gets bigger or smaller, it might be because you have too much tissue. You may need to go down a band size or down one cup size. When shopping for a new bra, look for bras with a low center gore, so that the cups will fit better on your body type without digging into your armpits, which can cause back pain. In general, bras with straps that aren't adjustable work best if you have medium-to-large breasts. The strap should also be set higher on your rib cage than on your shoulders -- usually 2 inches above the upper breastbone, although it varies based on your body shape. If you get a very small amount of support from the straps, try wearing them closer together; the bra should be snug enough around your neck but not covering your shoulder blades, so that you don't end up looking like an astronaut hugging your boobs. Don't use padded bras unless they meet your other safety requirements.Q: Hey! I just bought an old bra from Walmart that isn't in good condition but still fits great and makes me feel amazing in it! Can I keep it? A: Unfortunately, yes. However, you'll want to wash it first. Q: Why are you giving me advice on how to fix a busted out bra?!?A: People ask all the time if it's possible to return a product that doesn't fit right. Yes, it is possible. Here are some things to consider when deciding whether to return something:1) Is the item damaged? Broken stitches? Stitches coming undone? Pus on the inside?2) Do you want the item replaced?3) Do you have the correct size?4) Have you tried other sizes?5) Did you follow all instructions on the package?6) Was it in perfect"

Q: What can be done about braces? A: There are some things that can help prevent them from falling out in the first place (see below). They should be replaced every three years or as directed by your dentist. If they fall off during a visit, ask for a reminder. Some dentists will also do this procedure at home, although sometimes this isn't practical. You'll need to see a professional who specializes in keeping them on properly and repairing any damage caused by wear.


You may experience other problems like arthritis from wearing braces. But most people don't notice anything wrong until they start getting teeth pulled out. It's best not to worry too much about these types of issues though.

It's possible to replace braces yourself, but this isn't something that most people would consider unless there was serious damage. When they were installed, braces were usually made of metal, so they have lots of potential for causing health concerns over time. In fact, one study found that when you use steel braces for more than 10 years, the metals can be absorbed into the body in ways that cause liver disease, heart disease, kidney failure and nerve-damage. Even after you get rid of the rest of your dentures, they could still affect your bones. So, there's a good reason to never let anyone try to fit new ones without consulting a professional first. Most dentists require two full set of replacements before they'll even give you a call!

If you already have worn and broken braces, you should keep them as long as possible. Then try to find someone else who has them to buy them. That way, you can always go back to having regular dental visits.","gum infection

You can get dental work done to remove them or you can have a cavity filled. If it's not clear whether surgery is needed, call us at 1-888-894-9191.

Q: I'm having trouble sleeping. Can you help? A: The best thing to do if you're experiencing trouble falling asleep is try using an alarm clock with light or sound. Some people even use electronic devices such as cell phones and computers when they want to go to sleep. Do not drink alcohol before bedtime because it reduces your ability to fall asleep, so it's important that you have plenty of water on hand. It may take some time for your body to adjust to new routines after a period of sleep deprivation, but most adults feel much better once they've gone through an extended period of sleep deprivation. Please see our Sleep Resources page for more information about improving your sleep quality.

Q: How long should I expect my wisdom teeth to last? A: Your dentist will recommend a maximum duration of 4 years (5 if you are younger than age 12). However, all teeth are subject to decay over time so in general we suggest you keep your wisdom teeth until you're between ages 8 and 13.

Q: Does my child need a fluoride treatment? A: Fluoride treatments help prevent cavities in children by inhibiting the growth of bacteria in the gums. There's no scientific evidence that fluoride prevents wisdom teeth from growing. Fluoride may also slow down the rate of progression of dental caries. For more details about fluoride, including what levels of fluoridation are recommended, please refer to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website at www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/whatisfluoridated/.","I would never want to do that because it is painful.

Q: Do you remember when you started lifting? Did you ever think about the money?A: No. My first job out of high school was working at the Walmart in my hometown as an assembly line worker. That was kind of cool and I loved doing that. Then one day I got laid off from that job and the only thing I could get that paid well enough was sales for a company called AIG. I went there because I wanted to work with people who were really passionate about helping people make their dreams come true. When you're young, you just assume you can make a living doing what you love. But unfortunately that wasn't the case at all.

Q: What advice would you give someone starting out today?A: Start your own business! Seriously! You can be successful, rich or happy by yourself. If you put a little bit of time into building something that matters to you, then you'll always have people who look up to you, people who will help you along the way and you'll have friends who you can count on when times get tough.

Q: Tell us about some of the things people may miss about you?A: Well, I grew up in Houston; I am an African-American woman, so I had to learn how to deal with racism. There were times where I couldn't go out alone. People didn't want me around because they thought I might have been involved in drugs. As I got older, I made a concerted effort to get over that and become a better person. And then when I found God, he gave me a new lease on life. He allowed me to see a world beyond racism and bigotry. I met a wonderful man named Billy Ray Cyrus. We became very close friends and we ended up becoming great brothers. I'm very lucky to have him as a brother.

Q: How did you meet Billy Ray?A: We were both part of a rap group called The Family, which included Willie Nelson, Mavis Staples, Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu, John Legend and Big Boi. We came together because we all felt like we needed to stay strong during tough times. The Family formed in 1989 and we released our first album 'The Love Movement' in 1992.

When you have a wisdom tooth you may experience some discomfort in your mouth, especially on the gum line and even between your teeth (see picture). This is because when you are chewing with your front teeth and your tongue is moving down into your lower jaw, it pulls on the wisdom tooth causing the gum tissue and bone underneath to move out of place so that the tooth doesn't fit properly back in position after your food has been eaten and saliva collected. The problem can be aggravated if the wisdom tooth is overgrown or malformed.


Q: What should I do if my child has problems swallowing?

A: Try not to eat too fast or force anything down his throat. If he isn't able to swallow immediately, give him small sips of liquids such as juice, milk, or water, which should help loosen up the tissues around the wisdom tooth. Be sure to cleanse his mouth thoroughly before trying any new foods.

If the problem persists, see your child's dentist or pediatrician for possible treatment options.","can be used for toothache

How long will it take to see results?

In the past, many doctors and dentists gave up trying to treat people with arthritis who have difficulty swallowing. Now, that approach is being abandoned because of a growing realization that chewing and swallowing are mutually exclusive. A patient's ability to swallow depends on his or her ability to chew, so if those two functions don't work well together, the result may be poor oral health. But this type of problem doesn't typically get better within weeks or months, so most people with arthritis need treatment for years before they start to feel any improvement in their symptoms.

If you're worried about your ability to eat and drink because of your condition, talk to your doctor about options to help prevent serious problems. For example, many people find that taking medications designed to ease pain and swelling after dental procedures such as root canal treatment can improve both eating and drinking. Some people with arthritis develop severe constipation when they stop taking these medications. However, sometimes oral surgery or other treatments can help relieve some forms of constipation (diarrhea) associated with arthritis while preventing others from developing completely.","dental procedures.

a) wisdom tooth cut is the removal of one or more teeth, usually the front lower teeth (1st and 2nd molars). These are not done to treat any type of cavities or infections, they are performed primarily for cosmetic reasons. b) oral surgery: a procedure where the entire tooth is removed. Examples include extractions (removal of part of the dentin), root canal surgery, crowns/cones, fillings (procedures that form or seal in your mouth) and other procedures that remove all of the hard tissue inside the tooth structure. c) Gum disease (periodontal): periodontal diseases are caused by bacteria which build up on or around the gum tissues causing inflammation, bleeding and infection. Periodontal disease can cause serious damage to your gums. The only treatment of this condition is keeping your gums clean and healthy and using an antiseptic mouthwash regularly. d) infection (gum abscess): infection is a bacterial infection of your gums. Infection may be caused by a virus or bacteria but most commonly it's a yeast overgrowth, often due to poor hygiene. Symptoms can include redness and swelling at the site of the infection, pain when chewing or swallowing food and loss of saliva.

For example, some cancers are rare, such as breast cancer. But, others are common, such as prostate cancer. Cancerous cells grow uncontrollably, resulting in painful growths called tumours. Treatments vary from patient-to-patient based on how dangerous their cancer is, as well as their overall health. Some forms of cancer will require surgical removal. Other cancers can go into remission with appropriate treatment and follow-up visits.

It's not always the dentist that needs to be careful, it can also happen when your dentist pulls the wisdom teeth out as a result of an infection. This causes your gums to bleed and cause pain and inflammation in the mouth. The best thing you can do for yourself is to use dental dams or gums that keep your gums from bleeding during any dental procedure.


Q: why should I take care of my teeth?A: The first step is to brush your teeth properly every day and eat healthy foods. If you have tooth decay, brushing your teeth everyday will help prevent decay in the future. When you do get cavities, fillings are easy to remove and fillings don't need to come out again! Be sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day to help flush away toxins. Never swallow anything from the toilet bowl. Do not let children under age 8 handle toothbrushes unless they are wearing a rubberized glove.


Q: how does my oral health compare to other people's?A: Your oral health is similar to others' but there are some things you can do to make them better. Take care of your diet and exercise regularly so your body has the energy needed to fight off infection. Try not to bite your lips or tongue and never chew food directly into your teeth. Don't put sugar or other sweeteners in your mouth until after they've been swallowed completely. If you have dry lips, try applying warm oil on the affected area. If the condition persists, see your doctor.


Q: what if I'm having trouble eating healthy? How can I improve my oral health?A: For those who struggle to stick to their new dietary habits, you may want to consider making small changes. You might try cutting back on sugary snacks, or maybe even cutting down on salt for good. These small adjustments may help you begin to feel healthier immediately. Once you've made these small steps, continue to watch your progress and see if you're able to find healthier ways to consume your favorite foods. If necessary, ask friends and family members to join you in making small improvements so you can continue to reap the benefits of a balanced diet.


Q: What about taking supplements?A: Taking supplements isn't recommended by most experts. However, vitamin D, calcium and magnesium can all play a role in maintaining proper oral health. Even though these supplements aren't necessarily required for optimal oral health, they can still help with preventing infections","gum infections \r

Dental disease in adults is the most common and costly problem encountered by children. It may cause chronic pain, discomfort, and infection. When dental problems are present, they often lead to oral pain, which can be severe enough to interfere with a child's daily life.1-4 Children who have significant pain or discomfort caused by dental diseases often require dental care and medications.5 Dental problems occur when a person suffers an injury that makes it difficult for teeth to form (cavities). Cancers (such as cancerous and noncancerous) also damage or destroy teeth and gums; these types of lesions are known as periodontal disease. Periodontitis causes inflammation on the bone between the root of a tooth and the surface tissues surrounding the tooth.6 The inflammatory process leads to increased blood flow to the soft tissue tissues around the tooth. This changes how the cells of the tooth function—making them smaller.7 Most children with periodontitis don't experience any symptoms at first. They develop painful spots that become infected over time if not treated.8 As the bacteria infect the tooth surfaces, they grow and multiply, creating pockets where more growth occurs.9 These spaces usually contain large amounts of dead cells and fluid called plaque. Plaque accumulates inside and around the tooth because bacteria love to consume sugars and starches found in food.10 In addition to causing discomfort, untreated plaque can make the teeth brittle and cause decay.11 Inflammation has been shown to reduce salivary flow and lead to more frequent and serious toothache.12 The bacteria are able to travel through gingival crevices to the pulp chamber of the tooth, from where they produce acid.13-16 The acid produces acidic saliva, which protects the teeth against the effects of acid produced by mouth flora.17 If there are no antibiotics available to treat this condition, antibiotics can help stop the progression of inflammation and protect the teeth.18-23

Eating disorders EATING DISORDERS—that is, eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED), compulsive overeating, food addiction (FA), and other eating disorders—are characterized by excessive intake of certain foods (especially carbohydrates, fats, and sweets) and/or lack of appetite resulting from restriction of calories and/or restricting one's behavior.24,25 Eating Disorders can affect people of all ages, but are much more prevalent among girls than boys."

Q: drug addiction\nA: drugs addiction.

I've seen a lot of people asking about the different types of answers that can be given to this question, so I'll just give some general information here:

1) A yes answer will be one where the person has used or is currently using (or trying to use or trying to start using) a substance, including alcohol and/or tobacco in any form and/or at any frequency since age 18.

2) A no answer will be one where the person is not currently using or has stopped using (including stopping altogether), but hasn't had a drink or smoked for 2 months prior. This is known as abstaining from all substances. This type of response may also be called ""non-binge"" behavior.

3) In the case where someone smokes while sober, they are considered non-smokers.

4) For those who have been abusing drugs, their last substance use was two years ago. The most recent substance use must have happened within the past five days.

5) If a person has recently started using another substance, then their past usage counts towards both criteria 1 & 3.

6) If a person uses other types of illegal substances such as heroin, ecstasy etc., they cannot be classified as being an addict. They must only be classified as having abused an illicit substance.","Yes, I do. A: Do you feel like it's your fault? B: No. What are you talking about? A: You're taking medications that affect the way the brain communicates and if you take these at a time in your life where you don't have enough energy to use them properly then those chemicals will be released into the system when they should not be released. They can cause extreme anxiety and depression and other physical problems so just go get some rest or change up your medication schedule. Don't think this is something you made up on your own because there has been research done on how ADHD drugs work. This is real science and you have nothing to worry about. And don't let anyone try to convince you otherwise because it's their lack of understanding that makes them say such things.

So there you have it. If I were you, I would tell my kids the truth about medication. Just as you've told me the truth about taking vitamins for good health. It's all about being aware and following the advice of people who know what they are doing. When it comes down to it, no one has ever died from an overdose of vitamins, nor did any of my parents die from drug overdoses in our family. But I suppose we could be at risk.

Step 2: Establish a schedule for getting your ADHD medications.

A: Make sure you have enough sleep at night, and try to take the medication as close to bedtime as possible. Try to get 8 hours of sleep per night on average, which is about 14 hours. B: Take your medication when you are hungry, or if it seems like a good time for you to do so. If you aren't hungry when taking your meds, consider switching to a lower dose that will be more comfortable for you to eat. You might also consider having someone else help with food intake during your medication times. C: Keep a running list of your medications in case you forget what they were. This way you can quickly switch to another drug. D: Get plenty of exercise, and try not to smoke! Smoking has been shown to cause problems with dopamine levels and worsen ADHD symptoms.

Step 3: Be patient and persistent.

A: Don't give up; just keep trying! Stay on track with your treatment plan, because it's going to take time before your symptoms start to improve. When you're starting out, it may take weeks to months to notice improvement. After a while though, you should begin seeing improvements.

The number of questions for the first part of this questionnaire were increased. However, since both groups performed equally well during the second part and the majority of participants (56%) did not have any psychiatric diagnoses at baseline, it was decided to focus on a group with only one additional question: ADHD symptoms or behaviour\nA: behavioural \o/

When we compared our findings with those reported in previous studies [6], [7], we found no difference between the two groups regarding age (P = 0.29). The gender differences are also not significant for this subgroup as there is an equal proportion of males and females aged 18–39 years. Since several previous studies have shown that older adults suffering from ADHD exhibit reduced IQ scores [8], it can be speculated that the higher IQ score may contribute to the lower anxiety levels observed in the older adults presenting with ADHD. A previous study had demonstrated that children who present with more severe forms of ADHD show greater impairment than their peers [9]. In contrast, we could find no evidence that the presence of ADHD symptoms or behaviour was associated with poorer performance during the test. It is worth noting that none of these previous studies investigated the association between ADHD symptoms or behaviour and anxiety levels. Furthermore, many studies on the association between ADHD and anxiety symptoms and behavioural problems [10] – [13] showed that anxiety and depressive symptoms and behaviours in childhood are associated with adult ADHD, but their role has been less consistently established. An important limitation of our study concerns the small sample size and small range of symptom measures used in order to make comparisons across various studies. This is a common problem when comparing results from different samples from the same population. We therefore consider the present study to be underpowered because we used too few items per assessment session. Also, although we use validated diagnostic instruments, they are based on self-report and do not reflect clinical observations. Although the reliability of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC) is high [14], [15], its validity and reliability in the general population have never been studied.

We did not find any differences in the cognitive function assessed by the test. All three tasks (executive function, attentional set shifting, and memory) yielded similar results. Executive function tests require the ability to control one's own responses and allow individuals to think clearly about complex situations, while attentional set shifting is required to attend to a task-relevant stimulus while simultaneously ignoring irrelevant stimuli.

Q: what is the best way to manage emotional problems? A: talk therapy, psychotherapy. Q: what is your take on meds and ADHD? A: most kids with ADD or ADHD find they need a lot of help if their symptoms are not resolved. Many people have good outcomes after starting medications (usually methylphenidate) to try to get their symptoms under control. There have been some studies where people who had stimulants and behavioral treatment were more likely to do well than those who did not. This suggests that there may be something about these two treatments that work together. I think we know enough now that we can safely start medications for many children with ADHD.

Q: What are the potential risks with taking an MAO inhibitor? A: The only risk is that it could cause suicidal thoughts in certain people, but this has not been reported yet. However, please discuss all options carefully with your doctor before taking any kind of medication!


Q: how long will my child's medication last? A: It depends on the exact prescription. In general, we recommend that kids have a prescription that lasts 2 years or longer. We have found that 5 months is usually sufficient for most children. If your child gets worse or requires additional treatments, he/she should continue taking the medication for another month or so until his condition improves. Please contact our office before you stop taking your child's medication because sometimes we can't give you the correct dosage back if you're changing prescriptions. Also note that when you're switching from one form of medication to another, you must first go through a ""dosing adjustment"" process that ensures that your current medication has no unwanted effects. See below for information on adjusting your dose.


Q: How much does it cost to treat ADHD? A: Our costs vary based on the type of medication used. For example, if a family decides to use Concerta, it may cost $80 per month plus taxes. If they choose to use Seroquel, then it might cost $60 per month. These prices are approximate. All prescriptions require insurance coverage for the majority of patients. Insurance rates depend upon the specific drug and the provider. To see which ones are available in your area, check out the National Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services' website:","I am on a meds for ADHD, which is a medication that can have some side effects.

Q: I am in a long term relationship (3 years) with someone who is not my husband. We have been together about 9 months. We were both married once before and ended up divorced. After we broke up, he stayed around for 6 months after we separated. During those six months, he started showing symptoms of being addicted to porn. Our relationship was already rocky at best during that time. I didn't want him around because I wasn't comfortable around him in general. When it came to our relationship again, I felt like I should let go of any feelings of animosity toward him because he'd obviously turned his life around for the better by staying in the marriage. However, the more I thought about what he did and how much worse it could become if he continued down this path, the less I wanted him around me. This week, he told me that he needed to quit watching porn and he told me why – he found himself doing it again and it was making him feel good so he decided to stop. Is that cheating? Should I tell him I'm worried because he might be tempted to cheat again? I guess we'll find out soon enough.

A: To answer your questions first off, ""cheating"" can mean many different things in different situations and circumstances. One person may say they're not sure how much their spouse enjoys sex -- that's cheating. Another could say they're only happy when their spouse gets naked and that's adultery. For Sara, her husband was using porn. That doesn't look like the kind of behavior that will change, no matter how much it makes her feel like quitting porn is the right thing to do.

Treatment for CEDs is often aimed at reducing inflammation or improving the immune system function. The goal of treatment is generally to decrease symptoms to the extent possible. If this doesn't work, then drug therapy may be considered (see below).


For CEDs that are due to an infection, antibiotics will usually reduce the duration or severity of your symptoms. However, most infections resolve on their own without any intervention. You can also try a combination of antihistamines and antacids as well as dietary changes, such as giving up dairy products, egg yolks and seafood.

It can also affect mood, behaviour, speech and thinking. In the past, epilepsy was usually treated by giving powerful sedatives such as haloperidol.""","1-3C:2-7T:8+P:13+I:4+N:6+E:5(Td) (i.e., anorexia and malnutrition). These symptoms are similar to those seen in children with acute or long-standing anemia, indicating that the disorder is a form of primary amenorrhea, which may be related to low thyroid function. Thyroid dysfunction has been suggested as a possible cause for the onset of PMDD [25]. The condition can also occur after gonadectomy due to decreased secretion of luteinizing hormone during treatment. Women who have undergone a hysterectomy may experience the first phase of PMDD before the full symptoms begin. Pregnancy may precipitate PMS, although it does not necessarily lead to PMDD. However, women undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy often develop a secondary hormonal imbalance, possibly affecting their mood state. In some cases, there seems to be an association between PMS and menopause [26].

PMDD may present as hyperthymic episodes lasting from several weeks to many months during which one feels irritable, depressed, anxious and/or ""off."" It is also characterized by depressive episodes lasting 3 to 6 months, usually occurring when a woman experiences stress. This type of depression generally arises out of negative emotions such as guilt, shame, anger, self-blame, anxiety, frustration and frustration about work problems, family relationships, relationship difficulties, sexual relationships, or financial problems. Symptoms of emotional distress include loss of appetite, sleep disturbances, feelings of fatigue, poor concentration, lack of interest, feeling teary, increased sadness, decreased libido and increased hunger. Women typically seek help from others, but if they do not receive any help, they will feel isolated from society. They experience more social isolation, less ability to maintain friendships, and are more likely to live alone than women without PMDD. There are no known medical treatments specifically directed toward these symptoms, however, medications like antihistamines, antidepressants, beta blockers, antihypertensives, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and SSRIs may be used by people suffering from PMDD [27,28]. Other than psychotherapy, which is considered effective for treating major depression, other treatments used for PMDD include exercise programs, cognitive behavior therapy, yoga, acupuncture, hypnosis, biofeedback, meditation, and mindfulness practice.

After 2 months of doing this my immune system went completely down the drain and now im literally dying every time i drink milk.

B4B.2. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) [see Warnings and Precautions]

Symptoms/signs

Symptoms of CFS may include severe tiredness, low energy, sleep disturbances, weight loss, gastrointestinal problems such as bloating or constipation, cold intolerance, joint pain, muscle aches, arthritis and other symptoms. In many people with CFS, there is no known cause for these conditions and they are likely caused by an immune response that attacks the central nervous system (brain). Common causes of this reaction include infection, injury, trauma, chemotherapy treatments, medications and radiation treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiological treatments, autoimmune disorders, genetics, mental health disorders, viral infections, toxins, brain cancer, head injuries, tumors and organ transplantation.

Signs may appear suddenly or develop slowly over several weeks, months or years. Symptoms do not have to be present at all times. They can also occur without any obvious trigger, for example when having a fever. Many people who suffer from CFS have unexplained illnesses. Although it is rare, some people experience periods where their symptoms disappear completely before gradually becoming more frequent again.

The exact nature of CFS is unknown. The term ""myalgic encephalomyelitis"" describes the disease's symptomology but does not define its underlying pathophysiology. Some researchers think the disease originates with exposure to infectious agents; others believe it results from an immune attack on specific parts of the central nervous system. Scientists are still struggling to identify the mechanisms involved and discover the exact reason why some individuals experience CFS while others do not. It has been suggested that genetic factors play a role in causing CFS, although the precise role of genes is unclear. Other possible triggers could involve environmental factors, nutritional deficiencies or drug reactions. The exact cause of CFS remains unknown.

There is currently no cure for CFS and most of those who get better recover within a few days or weeks. But some people report long lasting recovery after starting treatment for CFS.

Treatment with interferon alpha (IFN-alpha), ribavirin (RV-18), etanercept (Enbrel) or glatiramer acetate (Glatiramer) is recommended if CFS is suspected. Treatment should take place every three to six months. There are several drugs available as","hyperactive nervous system, diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome, liver cirrhosis or hepatitis

The most common side effects are vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, diaphoresis (itching) and fatigue. Rarely people get allergic reactions such as skin rash. The most serious possible side effect is infection of the gut, which can lead to death.

What other drugs will interact with Tylenol?

Tylenol works well in combination with some medications that are also used for general medical problems, including antibiotics, anti-depressants, antihistamines, blood thinners, chemotherapy and epilepsy medication. It may not be safe or effective when taken alone.

You should always tell your doctor about all prescription and over-the-counter medicines you use, especially those that have ingredients you don't understand. Some of these items may cause a reaction similar to that seen with Tylenol. These include cold and allergy medications; muscle relaxers, sedatives, tranquilizers, sleeping pills, birth control pills, antidepressant drugs, muscle relaxer, antipsychotic drugs, anticonvulsant agents, insulin, calcium channel blockers, and anticoagulants. Also, be sure your doctors know what tests you've had before starting any new medicine.

If you're taking an antidepressant, you'll need to stop it first before starting Tylenol to make sure there won't be unwanted or unexpected changes in your brain chemistry. You might experience withdrawal symptoms if you suddenly take an antidepressant after using Tylenol. If this happens you should call your doctor immediately.

How should I store Tylenol?

Store Tylenol at room temperature between 68°F and 77°F (20°C and 25°C). Keep out of reach of children and pets. Do not keep expired medications on hand. Keep Tylenol and its packaging closed tightly and away from light. Avoid contact with excessive heat, sparks or open flame. Discard unused capsules within 3 months of opening. Discard empty bottles after 2 years of storage.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and rheumatic fever are considered autoimmune diseases in which the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells, causing them to attack their own tissues. RA is a disease of unknown cause that develops after an injury or infection and most often affects the joints, skin and lungs. It occurs in 1 out of 50 people. Most cases progress over several years but some may go on for decades. Symptoms vary depending on the site where symptoms occur, whether they have flares or become severe, how quickly they progress and what stage they are at when diagnosed. There is currently no cure but medications can help control symptoms.Rheumatic fever is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). The bacteria causes inflammation of the airways and lungs as well as other organs such as kidneys and bladder, and it is usually milder than RA. However, MAP can be fatal and has killed many children who were born prematurely and had previously been healthy. Symptoms typically begin one week to four weeks after exposure. Most infections resolve within two months but if left untreated, MAP can develop into pneumonia.Symptoms include fever, chills, fatigue, coughs, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, swollen glands and sometimes red eyes and swelling of the face and hands. If the infection spreads beyond these early stages, it can result in a life-threatening lung infection called tuberculosis. Symptoms of RA include joint pain, muscle aches and stiffness, bone pain, kidney problems and other organ damage. A person with RA or Rheumatoid arthritis can also experience severe symptoms from the autoimmune condition Sjogren's syndrome.","Fibromyalgia is a disease of the central nervous system and involves widespread changes in pain, sleep, appetite, mood, movement, anxiety, fatigue, depression, and other symptoms. Fibromyalgia also affects some areas of the brain. The main complaint of fibro patients are generalized or localized pain with no obvious cause. FMS has been found in more than 200 different ethnicities. Patients have reported having joint aches, low back pain, menstrual problems such as amenorrhea (no periods), urinary tract infections, and skin rashes. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, but they tend to be worse on the right side of the body (i.e., the ""right side"" of their body). Some symptoms are transient; others persist for months or years.

Mental Symptoms/Abnormal Behaviors

Although there are many types of mental disorders that may affect people with FM, certain common symptoms are listed below.

1. Depersonalization - This condition includes feelings of unreality, detachment, disassociation from reality, detachment from emotions, or feeling detached from yourself. These sensations seem to occur when you are not thinking about something and are unrelated to any particular external event or situation. Examples include being unable to recognize your own name or what it means to be ""in the moment."" Other effects include being able to forget how you got into bed and forgetting where you were last night. In general these feelings do not lead to overt behavior which would need professional help. However, some people with depersonalization experience difficulty sleeping, nausea, vomiting, or emotional lability.

2. Hallucinations - Sometimes people will see things that aren't actually there. For example, someone may think he or she sees a person's face move before realising this is just an image projected by his or her mind onto a wall. Hallucinations may be visual, auditory, tactile, taste, smell, touch, or other forms. They are often confused with illusions or delusions and can present themselves differently depending upon who is experiencing them at the time.

3. Somatic Symptoms - These symptoms may appear similar to those of schizophrenia or delusional disorder and may consist of somatic complaints like unexplained muscle stiffness, loss of strength, or trouble walking. There are various causes of these pains. They could stem from physical damage to nerves due to diabetes, infection, inflammation, or injury, stress, hormonal imbalances, or abnormal sleep patterns or activity levels. It is important"

It seems to be related to the fact that my legs are extremely sensitive to cold and they have been getting worse over time. Q: What do you think about the use of an ECG monitor? A: The best way to tell if something is wrong with your heart is to get an EKG. There may be some false positives with other tests like chest X-rays, but it will help in making sure that there isn't a cardiac issue before anything else happens. I'd say if there is no evidence of a problem at all on any blood work (ie normal pH levels) then just wait. If the pain does not improve within 24 hours of starting a new medication (including NSAIDs), I would suggest waiting another 6 months or so before trying a different treatment as you can never be too careful in this situation.

I'm not sure how many there are but, if that was the case, would you want your doctor to perform it?

Q: Can one's kidneys be removed as well?

Yes, in certain rare circumstances. These patients usually have an extremely weak immune system which makes them more susceptible to infections and is also why they're prone to developing kidney disease. Patients with this condition who have had their kidneys removed often require dialysis or a kidney transplant. The only time this isn't true is when a patient has died from the complications of the procedure itself.

Hi Dr. Gernsbacher, I am very sorry to hear about your death. What were the details you were able to find on the cause of his death? He was a healthy man until he developed chest pain, then developed sudden heart failure which led to his death. Also, I just read that he was diagnosed with POTS. Can you please tell me more about this diagnosis and how it affects someone? Thank you!

The specific medical term associated with POTS is pulmonary atresia. This means that the lungs are too small for blood flow through them. It occurs most commonly with severe obesity (body mass index over 40), diabetes, high blood pressure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).


Pulmonary atresia is caused by a lack of oxygen getting into the body. It manifests in several ways, including shortness of breath, decreased lung function, increased fatigue, and muscle weakness. Often, these symptoms occur suddenly and without warning, while some people may notice nothing unusual during an episode. But all POTS sufferers should seek immediate care and refer themselves to a physician immediately, especially if they experience symptoms lasting longer than 2-3 days.

Introduction There has been a recent increase in interest in treatments for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly among patients with asthma [1]. Recently, evidence emerged suggesting that several drugs used to treat asthma might be useful in COPD and therefore can improve patient outcomes [2], [3], including nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), the precursor of butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors, which can reduce inflammatory cytokines and oxygen demand by altering endothelial nitric oxide production [4]–[6]. NDGA was first identified as having antiinflammatory activity against human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro [7], [","No, not really. I just think it is a physical response to stress and may be related to my allergies. I have been taking Benadryl for the past few months (to ease some of my symptoms) and there isn't anything noticeable yet but as soon as my allergy symptoms are better then I will start using more and more of this medication.A: Yes. My son has had it for about 5 years now. He was diagnosed with POTS in January 2004. I took him off the meds completely, however he kept getting sicker and worse as time went on. Finally in September 2007 he was hospitalized again because his fever got so bad that the doctors thought he might die. When they finally did discharge him back home he said it was one of the worst experiences of his life. The following month I started trying to get him back on the meds again. I found that if you don't take the meds for too long at first and try not to go back to them unless your doctor gives you permission then you can usually control the flare ups without any problems. Also, if you have an allergic reaction to Benadryl you can make a homemade remedy by mixing 1/4 cup powdered milk with 2 cups water and giving it to yourself once or twice daily until your symptoms subside.A: Yes. You should see your primary care physician very frequently for blood work and other tests. It's also good to talk with your family physician, especially if they suspect you might have a disease like POTS and heart failure. A recent study shows that chronic fatigue syndrome patients who were prescribed medications to treat their illnesses experienced greater improvements than those on placebo when compared to patients who didn't take these drugs.The PODCAS system also includes a section where you can ask questions about certain diagnoses. For example, POTS was classified as ""other"" and not officially listed under the PODCAS category. However, the information provided about POTS is quite helpful and provides links to further research.A: Your body can react differently to each type of medicine. If you're having trouble sleeping, the best way to know whether you need sleep aids is to check with your pharmacist. Some medicines such as Valium or Xanax can cause insomnia. Don't give up hope. Many people find relief from non-pharmaceutical approaches including exercise, nutrition, and rest. If you want to try a new herbal product, try it on its own for about 3 weeks before deciding what works best for you. Most","I've never had that. If it happens to you, there are many things you can do. You might want to see your doctor or endocrinologist for some tests. Your peds should be able to give you a more specific answer to the question about what would cause this, but if it is due to thyroid problems, the first thing you need to determine is whether you have hypothyroidism and then find out which medications you may need.

Q: How long does it take for me to feel better? A: As soon as possible. This condition will get worse before it gets better. Do not let any symptoms last longer than 3 days. At most they may last 6-12 hours. Once you are in remission (no new signs of the disease) you can move on with life.

Q: Are there other treatments that have been used successfully? A: No, unfortunately. There isn't much research available yet, so we don't know much about how effective these treatments are and whether they work. That said, there seems to be at least one drug therapy that works well in patients like you who have had the disease for a while - a beta blocker called propranolol. In fact, propranolol has been shown to help even when it is given at the same time as an antidepressant medication. It's important to remember though, that both antidepressants and propranolol also have side effects. Some people will respond fairly quickly, while others may need to take them together with a lifestyle change such as exercise. When taking either drug combination, make sure to stop the other drug from working before starting the third one.

Q: Is there anything else I should keep in mind about my diagnosis? A: Yes, you should realize that you have a very real physical illness, and you should always stay aware of it. Make sure you tell everyone around you, including family members, doctors, nurses, friends, and classmates. Talk about your health concerns and ask questions about your symptoms. The next step, hopefully, is that you'll become familiar enough with your symptoms to manage them yourself. You'll no doubt discover many things that could potentially be helpful to you!","POTS Nausea- Vomiting

T1: POTS, high blood pressure.

P2: POTS, low blood pressure

V2: high cholesterol or triglycerides.","I think that the ""low"" and ""high"" levels are a combination of the two, or one and then the other. The rest is up to you. It's like if you had an allergy where your body gets all ""yucky/bad"" when you eat something that causes it but still wants to eat it anyway. You might have the ""bad"" part of the food, but the ""good"" parts keep coming back in. Q: Why do people have these symptoms? POTD: Probably because we're not used to feeling ""normal"".

Q: What would happen if someone were to die from this condition? Would they be able to go through life as normal (or would they experience much more severe symptoms)? A: People with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome can experience much milder symptoms than those who don't have the disease. However, they also tend to have some more severe symptoms such as weakness in their arms and legs (a mobility issue) and sometimes numbness (called peripheral neuropathy). They may also experience fatigue, depression, headaches, and chronic joint pain. This often continues for years after the initial onset of illness. Symptoms usually last between 2-8 months. If left untreated, the disease can progress to cause problems with muscle control and balance. These complications can result in permanent disability and can cause death.","a lot of people get it when they take their first pills.

I am still learning how to live with it. For example, I have a friend who has been diagnosed for many years but not had to stop working. She goes back to work every weekend, and sometimes she even does her job in bed at night because she feels so great. I have found ways to cope, such as going on walks during the day instead of watching TV, reading books, listening to music and playing games with my children.

When I was in school, we were told to go home early if we felt sick. This doesn't really help. When you're busy working you just feel better so you let yourself forget about it.

You want to cry for someone, but you also want to laugh so it seems easier to do nothing than to suffer through crying for someone else. Then there are times when I cry while walking down the street with my kids, wondering why they won't eat their vegetables anymore. And then I tell myself it's OK because they've learned to make their own food from scratch. And that helps me too.

Now, some days I wake up feeling extremely stressed out, but I know how important it is to be able to continue with my activities without giving up. I guess that's one way I manage.

For now I'm doing everything I can to avoid getting sick – taking more naps, drinking lots of water, eating nutritious foods, etc. I'm definitely feeling much less fatigued though! So, for now, things are okay!","no, and the doctors are right. I do not know how to feel about this but I don't have any other answers right now.I am waiting for a phone call from my doctor who will discuss all of these things and find out what treatment options that will be available for me. A few weeks ago there was an article in the NY Times on ehrling's danlos syndrome but it is not well known so its importance cannot be understated. The article states that this disorder causes the body to produce antibodies against itself causing chronic fatigue syndrome. It also notes that if left untreated, patients can develop diabetes, heart disease and liver dysfunction as they age. However, the most dangerous part of the article is when they write ""Doctors say that they have seen increasing numbers of people with severe cases of EDS who may never get better."" Why would we ever think that that would be true? This is just one example that has been given by Drs. Rabiner and Gershon of Yale. Do you agree with their diagnosis or do you believe that these articles exaggerate some side effects of this condition?

Q: i've been using tic tac toe since my teenage years. I had 2 episodes of acute TTS (Tonic-Clonus) after I started taking ibuprofen and aspirin. I tried a low dose of acetaminophen and it helped a little bit, but the attacks were still very painful and lasted over a week each time. After a month I stopped using both drugs because it hurt too much, and they didn't help anything either. Recently, the symptoms became worse again and I took two more doses of acetaminophen and 1/2 a bottle of aspirin (all at once). They did not work either. I'm worried it might have something to do with acid reflux (which causes these problems), since I'm a smoker who often sneezes during periods of extreme stress. Do you think this could be a cause for concern? What should I try next?

A: Tics are a normal part of many people's lives. Tics are usually triggered by trauma, sleep disturbances, medications, infections, anxiety, and even physical activity. There are several types of Tics. If your symptoms get worse without stopping them, then you probably have Acute Tics. Your doctor will talk about your specific type of Tic and see whether there is anything he can suggest to help stop the attacks. You may want to use a mild form of antihistamine","No, it's not.

Treatments for Ehlers Danlos Syndrome

Treatment of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome is complex and requires a multidisciplinary team of specialists in neurology, orthopedic surgery, endocrinology, psychiatry, urology, hematology/oncology, gastroenterology, anesthesiology, rheumatology, pediatrics, and others to properly treat this condition. Some people with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome are genetically predisposed to develop it or suffer from genetic variations which make them more prone to developing it. The diagnosis of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome is made by conducting tests on blood samples taken from the person. If the test shows signs of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (e.g., abnormal heart rate), doctors may refer patients for further testing.

What treatments are available for Ehlers Danlos Syndrome?

There aren't any specific drugs that can be prescribed directly for Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. However, there are certain medications that can help alleviate symptoms associated with EDS.

Cortisone injections can reduce joint swelling

Exercise therapy exercises the muscles used in walking and running

Anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen may relieve muscle stiffness and inflammation

Steroids such as Prednisone can increase circulation around joint areas

The Mayo Clinic offers information about Ehlers Danlos Syndrome.

How serious is Ehlers Danlos Syndrome?

Ehlers Danlos Syndrome affects only a small percentage of the population. Most cases appear to resolve over time without treatment. People who suffer from EDS should take care to follow their doctor's advice regarding exercise, diet, stress management, and medication. They also need to understand how they're feeling and be willing to discuss how long they expect these changes to last.

Q: What is the difference between a ""cough"" and an ""asthma attack""?

A: A cough or wheeze may occur as part of the respiratory system (a symptom). If you feel like you're having one, it's probably because your airways are congested. Aspirations should be managed carefully as they can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia, obstruction, scarring, lung damage, and even death.

An asthma attack, also called an asthma attack, usually occurs when your lungs become irritated by something that causes them to expand or contract. These attacks often occur suddenly and without warning. Some examples of potential triggers include exposure to pollen, allergens, dust mites, household chemicals, smoke from fireplaces and automobiles, stress, coughing or sneezing, cold air, and hot/humid weather. Because people with asthma are at increased risk for developing breathing problems, these symptoms may last longer than typical asthma attacks.

For more details about what happens during an asthma attack, please refer to Asthma Attacks: What Happens?.

Q: Which medication do I take if I have asthma?

A: You need to make sure you get enough oxygen through the right type of inhaler. The following recommendations cover common types of inhalers:

Oxygen Intensive Asthmatic Airway Support

Intra-nasal inhalers

Oral (sniffable) inhalers

Sinus prongs (for children under 6 years old)

Subglottic devices (for adults over age 60)

Percutaneous airway support devices (including PAPRs)

Other medications that can be used to treat asthma include:

He has a history of hay fever and is using an antihistamine but he continues to have severe, persistent bronchitis and cough with phlegm production.

His chest x-ray shows:


In this case report we will discuss how the chest x-rays can be used as a screening tool for bronchiectasis, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid collection for fluid analysis, and pulmonary function tests (PFT).

Chest X-Ray:

If the lung function test results are negative or if there is no evidence of any air trapping by the lungs (i.e., no airflow obstruction), then bronchoscopy may be performed. Bronchoscope examination should follow bronchoscopic bronchoscopy if the clinical suspicion of bronchiectasis exists and the patient's symptoms continue to worsen despite use of an antihistamine or other treatment. If the diagnosis of bronchiectasis cannot be determined after bronchoscopy, a computed tomography scan (CT) with contrast medium may be considered. Contrast CT studies reveal the presence of small air spaces between the alveoli, bicarbonate levels in the blood, pulmonary capillary refill time, and changes in systolic and diastolic BP. These findings are helpful for the clinician to determine whether the patient needs further testing. However, these results do not necessarily correlate with clinically significant air trapping or lung disease.

How Can Chest X-Rays Be Used?

Most commonly, chest x-rays are used to screen patients suspected of having bronchial asthma. When evaluating the role of chest x-rays in the evaluation of a patient with severe, recurrent cough accompanied by acute exacerbations of symptoms, it is important to remember the following:

These images are often only useful when the underlying medical problem warrants their use. In some cases, bronchopneumonia, which causes chronic inflammation of the lungs, will be diagnosed on physical exam alone. Therefore, if you suspect your patient has chronic bronchitis, bronchoscopy is usually recommended. In addition, many studies have shown that in the absence of chest",allergy.,"an inhaler\nB: a chest tube or other device to inhale the drug into the lungs\nC: an injection of insulin

A new medication, called EpiPen, contains both epinephrine and a more powerful dose of norepinephrine. Both are used in emergencies to stop anaphylactic shock (an extreme allergic reaction that can cause death) when needed. They also can be injected directly into your muscles or arteries if you need them for treatment. However, they're not recommended as first-line treatments because their effect wears off quickly. This means a person would have to take two doses — one to start with, followed by another within 15 minutes if necessary — to get the same effects from each.","severe, persistent wheezing A: chronic cough, shortness of breath, chest pain A: coughing and shortness of breath

The condition was called 'incomplete respiratory failure' and the patient was treated by medical staff on site. They were then transferred to a local hospital where they died from their injuries.

While there is no evidence that a lack of oxygen caused his death it does raise serious questions over why it took so long for paramedics to arrive at his home after the accident.

The man's family have launched an investigation into how he ended up in this position. The coroner has also been asked to investigate.

Meanwhile the British Medical Association said it would investigate the circumstances surrounding Mr Sells' death.

Chief Executive Dr Mark Porter said: ""This tragic case highlights the need for further improvements in paramedic training, with greater emphasis placed on early identification of patients who require immediate attention and emergency treatment.""

A spokesman for the West Midlands Ambulance Service (WMAS) told MailOnline: ""On the night, we attended two calls about people having inhaled too much smoke from outside a house as they attempted to leave the area, one of which was a patient who had suffered what we believed was incomplete airway collapse following inhalation of second-hand smoke.

""Both these calls resulted in our attending a person suffering from non-life threatening respiratory distress. He was taken to hospital for further assessment and later pronounced dead due to the nature of his condition.

""We work closely with the ambulance service and other agencies within the West Midlands community to identify risks and issues and have put together comprehensive risk assessments across all our services.

Treatment Options


The most common treatment for acute asthma is inhaler therapy. A respiratory therapist or physician can help determine your best option at the time. An oral steroid may be prescribed as a second choice if your first medication has not been effective and you have severe breathing difficulties (see Treatment section below). The use of an inhaled corticosteroid such as prednisone (prednisolone) or hydrocortisone (hydrocortisone injection) in adults will result in greater short-term relief of symptoms than do topical steroids that are typically used to treat acute exacerbations. However, it should be noted that long-term use of these medications can cause adverse effects including gastrointestinal problems, increased blood pressure, or even liver damage.[1]

Inhaling pure oxygen from the air supply through a mask with a face mask can relieve some symptoms caused by the high concentrations of carbon dioxide inside the lungs, but other symptoms remain even when these gases are removed by this technique. Some experts recommend waiting until your asthma attack resolves before using masks with faces to aid in breathing.[2] You must have difficulty breathing without the mask because the breathing process involves gas exchange. To remove any residual gas trapped between the two walls of the mask, you need to breathe into it. Therefore, if your lung function begins to deteriorate after using a mask with a face mask, you may want to reconsider using such a device.

Some experts recommend using a nasal inhaler, which provides better control over your asthma symptoms. This type of inhaler allows you to take larger breaths and requires less frequent inhalation. If you are having trouble controlling your asthma symptoms while wearing a mask with a face mask, try switching to a nose spray or nasal ointment containing benadryl, methylphenidate, or salicylic acid (acetaminophen). These remedies work by blocking the release of histamine from mast cells, which causes sneezing, runny noses, and hives.[3]

Many children also experience wheezing and breathlessness, especially during an asthma attack. As they get older, their symptoms change and they may begin to lose control of their attacks. It is important to keep an eye on your child's condition and make sure he receives appropriate medical attention when he becomes too ill or refuses treatment. Keep track of your child's weight so you know how much medicine to give him based on his age, weight, and overall health"

A: ""Yes."" [They had a conversation] about the use of inhalers to control asthma. He said, ""You know, I've seen kids with it — they don't have that kind of trouble — but if you're not careful, there's always something going on."" And then he showed me a picture of his daughter, who was in kindergarten at the time. She had this terrible cough and was wheezing so hard she couldn't even speak. So I just thought to myself, ""Wow, there are these kids out there who need help and aren't getting it,"" because I'd never heard anything like that. I'm thinking to myself, ""This is a kid whose parents can do something right here."" It was very sad. But he gave me some great advice about asthma, which was good advice. And when we finished our meeting, he invited me over for dinner. We talked for hours.

There isn't a vaccine; there isn't a drug. The only way someone with AIDS could possibly be cured would be by finding a biological marker for the virus. As far as being treated for the disease, there's nothing that anybody has discovered yet, except maybe one thing: some combination of drugs that have long been used to treat tuberculosis. They work reasonably well — maybe better than those medicines — but they haven't made any headway in curing HIV/AIDS.

[We decided] if there were any treatments for AIDS, it should start with a different approach to treatment. That doesn't mean that we should stop treating patients with antiretroviral therapy; it means that we should treat them differently from how we currently do HIV medicine, treating them not as sick people but rather as healthy individuals in their prime who need to be cared for as such. We should also try to find ways to prevent transmission of HIV to others.

Because of your background, did you feel personally responsible for making sure that other people were taken care of?

There was an irony about it. Although I'd become a public health professional, I wasn't trained in HIV prevention. My first job out of graduate school was working as a public health nurse for the state Department of Health and Human Services. At that point, there weren't any federally funded programs designed specifically to reduce risk for HIV infection among young adults.","we have been able to reduce our annual cot- terine in the children, but this does not appear to be an effect on the number of episodes. Are there any other side effects?

T.P.: There are no other adverse events reported in the current study. At present, it is unclear if this could be a causal relationship. If so, we would expect that in patients with asthma who had been taking ocrelizumab for 5 years prior to enrolling into the trial, the incidence of bronchitis should have decreased significantly compared to the baseline rate. In addition, the efficacy of ocrelizumab in reducing CCR5 expression suggests that it might also suppress CXCR4 and therefore reduce the risk of developing asthma. However, the clinical significance of these findings is unknown at this time.","a : a condition characterized by inflammation of the air passages b : an abnormal condition in which the lungs are inflamed c ; the body's ability to produce this condition syn see inflamma- tion COV'i.DA.tion \,k6v-3-'da-sh9n\ n 1 : an act or instance of COVAHng 2 : a process that results from COV- ing COV>i<den*cy \'kav-(3-)d3n-,sTn-se\ n i^covery} : the state or fact of being recovered COV>i.DUce \'kav-(a-)dy3)r\ vt [L recoveryus, pp. of covenire to recover] obs : recover COV-i-der Xks-'vaC3)rd, -'ve(3)rd\ n l : one that recovers; specij : a person who has been given up to the mercy of God for sin 2 : a person who is delivered from prison COV.i.gle \'kav-3-.glUt\ adj : resembling a cobweb esp. when made with small fibers (as silk or mohair) cob-i-liar \'kav-a-,f61-3r\ adj : having cobwebs — cob-i-fllar-ly adv C0V'i.Iy \'kav-3-le\ adv [ME, fr.

The current model assumes that all these processes are equally important in predicting the ability to perform exercise in different subgroups of individuals. However, it has been shown in both young and older adults that some people have more effective suppression mechanisms than others [5]. Furthermore, there appears to be an individual difference in how well these components are recruited/activated, with some individuals having greater sensitivity to PRV compared to other people [11,12], while some individuals may have better suppression mechanisms because they respond differently to PVC when exercising [7,14]. In addition to differences in the recruitment/activation of these two components, there also appear to be distinct pathways underlying their regulation. Specifically, one group of studies suggest that the activation of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity is critical for suppressing lung function during physical exertion, whereas another group suggests that pulmonary vasodilatation, mediated by vagal afferents from musculature, is essential for this role [15,16]. A new approach using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging combined with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may help clarify the role played by these two components. By analyzing the activation patterns of human bronchial airways as they enter, progress through, and exit various regions of the respiratory tract, we find evidence for increased ventral SNS (VS) signal, particularly around the base of the larynx, during the inhalation phase of breathing and decreased VS signals during exhalation [17-20]. While most of our previous work focused on the interaction between the VS and bronchi, there was no prior research on changes in the relationship between the VS and the trachea over time. Previous investigations of this topic were limited by not exploring whether these effects occur during periods of active breathing and by including only nonstressed subjects. In this study, we included subjects who had previously participated in a physical activity intervention program (i.e., yoga), and examined whether changes in VL/VT ratio were observed after participants performed prolonged exercise sessions. We hypothesized that this change would","what is the most common symptom?

A: The most frequently observed adverse reaction to the ketogenic diet is an exacerbation of asthma. One study reported that in the course of 6 weeks, patients on a very-low carbohydrate diet had significantly higher levels of allergic symptoms than those who ate normal diets.6 Also, an early pilot study using high fat, low carb diets for children with acute rhinitis found that these diets led to more asthma attacks than a conventional ""asthma only"" diet.7 A number of other studies have shown that those on a very-low carb diet have a greater incidence of allergic rhinitis as well.8-12

Possible causes include hypoallergenic foods, such as soybean oil; the use of antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine or albuterol; and the addition of probiotics to food.13,14 In one small study, probiotic supplementation reduced wheezing episodes by nearly 60%.15 Another study showed no difference between probiotics and placebo in reducing febrile reactions.16

Q: What is the mechanism behind the effects of ketosis on inflammation?

A: Ketones are potent antidiabetic agents. They are also antiatherogenic because they bind directly to iron stores and prevent them from being oxidized by free radicals and subsequently activated by inflammatory processes.17 These mechanisms help explain why patients on the ketogenic diet often have less severe forms of insulin resistance and less disease activity in their pancreases.

In the past decade there has been growing interest in understanding how the ketogenic diet may be useful against several inflammatory diseases, including obesity, type II diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, lupus, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).18 Some scientists believe that the ketogenic diet could even aid in treating cancer through its ability to lower blood glucose levels and increase ketone bodies.19 However, a review of published randomized controlled trials did not find any evidence supporting this possibility.20

Although most clinicians are familiar with the benefits of diet modification in the treatment of various inflammatory disorders, few are aware that some inflammatory conditions can respond favorably to dietary intervention. This situation reflects an unfortunate history in which many physicians were trained in Western medicine and the traditional medical approach was assumed to be superior to alternative approaches.21 As noted above, however, recent research suggests that the role of","asthma. I have my own concerns that the current practice of medical doctors is to prescribe high dose cortisone for many patients who are not really ill in any way. My question is, what would you do if a patient stated that they were just as sick as normal but had developed a severe cold? Would you think about prescribing them low doses of cortisone or would you go with the higher dosage? A: No one has ever said that we should put more medication on a person when their symptoms don't correspond to their illness, nor that there's anything wrong with doing so. The idea of ""medication overkill"" would be absurd. We'd all agree to that. It's not a matter of life or death. If someone says they're suffering from some sort of serious respiratory infection, then by all means, give it to them. But people say they're depressed because they can't sleep, so treat them with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like Prozac, even though they haven't been diagnosed with depression. When you tell someone that they've got a virus, and the only thing you need is something to counterbalance your immune system so you won't get sick, most of us would say, ""Yeah, that sounds great."" However, given the fact that these patients aren't necessarily depressed -- they might actually be having panic attacks or anxiety problems -- why are they being prescribed antidepressants at all? It doesn't make sense.

Dr. Bostrom gives several examples where modern medicine has failed patients, but refuses to admit that its methods may be flawed. One such example comes from Dr. Bostrom's personal experience:

My first post-doc appointment was with a physician friend of mine named Michael Lebovits. He was very experienced with treating children and adolescents. During his first year as an internist he treated two dozen kids (ages 8 through 17), ranging from 7 months to 19 years old, and he was able to keep every single one alive. At the time, I was a young graduate student and was working part-time as a medical assistant. So this made me feel very privileged. On the other hand, if I didn't show up for work or try to take care of my own patients, he wouldn't be able to stay at his practice or afford to continue treating them. In addition to treating kids, he also cared for severely disabled adults. And he did it without ever seeing a doctor. His patients were mostly middle-aged white men who","it is more likely that children with asthma will develop their disease before age 5 than it would be for those without the disorder. However, there are several studies of children with asthma who were born in later years which suggest a small increase in prevalence with age at diagnosis in comparison to early-life exposures (Barker et al., 1983; Fombonne et al., 1984).

Q: is it possible that the increased risk occurs through chance?

A: There is no clear evidence of chance involvement. However, there are some potential confounders. First, both parental smoking and childhood respiratory illness are known to have an effect on offspring's susceptibility to asthma. If this link exists, we could expect a small but significant association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke during pregnancy and asthma development. Second, maternal and child socioeconomic status are well established to influence the risk of developing asthma. A high-income family might not receive regular prenatal care, or a mother may not have access to care due to health insurance limitations, for example, or poor communication with her doctor about a child's condition. The associations found by the authors are therefore particularly sensitive to such factors. Finally, the study population was predominantly Caucasian. However, many epidemiological studies have shown a relationship between race/ethnicity and asthma (Gottesman et al., 1977; Hsu et al., 1987; Kato et al., 1990; Pertwee & van den Heuvel, 1996), so the findings should be interpreted cautiously.

Q: What does this mean for public health?

A: This study indicates a positive association between household air pollution and childhood asthma. Studies show that when parents report a higher level of air pollution, their children are more susceptible to development of asthma. Thus, while we cannot rule out a causal role for childhood air pollution exposure, the data do not indicate that it causes all cases of adult asthma. More research is needed to determine whether ambient levels of particulate matter are associated with more severe asthma symptoms. Some other important questions still remain. First, how much lower can air quality go if particulates start being inhaled into our lungs instead of breathing them out? Second, what kind of effects on pulmonary function can occur from these smaller particles, even though they tend to be larger in size compared to the oxygen carried by hemoglobin? Third, what effects are seen after long-term exposure to low concentrations of fine particle pollution (PM 2.5 )? Fourth, what effect does air pollution play on asth","The question was, how do I deal with the respiratory symptoms from hay fever. A: All over. We have been through it a thousand times. And we will get to this in a minute. Q: What about hay fever itself? A: It is an infection of your lungs and your airways. When you breathe out, that's what's causing all these allergies. They are caused by pollen or mold or something else. This is also where the inhalers come in, because if you put them on top of it you can help calm down some of the airway problems.

The other important thing here to understand is that both men who are allergic to hayfever as well as those who have been exposed to hay fever as children, develop severe asthma. But there is no cure for either one. Both groups need to take medication which includes steroid therapy (if they choose) and antihistamines.

Some studies show that people who are allergic to hay fever have more symptoms than those who aren't, which makes sense when you think about the fact that you don't want to be breathing the same stuff every day. So most patients take allergy medications like Prednisone. However, a few people who are not allergic to hay fever take a different approach; they start their own supplement program instead.

Dr. John O'Connor has done research with patients who began taking the antihistamine Zyrtec in order to reduce their allergies and asthma attacks. These people reported that their condition improved significantly, compared to when they were using prednisone. Other researchers have found similar results with other treatments such as probiotics, enzymes and vitamins.

So it may sound crazy, but Dr. O'Connor says he has had two cases where his patients started out allergic to hay fever, developed hay fever symptoms after switching to a supplement regimen and then successfully reduced their health issues. For example, one patient took prednisone for 10 years and then switched to a low-allergy diet (the person lives near Boston), used topical steroids to treat the hay fever and continued to use prednisone for many years afterwards. This led him to believe that prednisone could actually cause more harm than good. He went back to treating the underlying problem with the right treatment.

What about the patients who cannot tolerate prednisone at all? How do they overcome their allergic reactions without any drugs? There are several supplements that will help you cope with allergic rhinitis. One of my favorites is called Gink","the importance of preventing air pollution.

1) The following medications have been reported to cause allergic reactions in children and adults: aminoglycosides, antibiotics, antifungals, azathioprine (an allergy medicine), barbiturates, carbamazepine (a seizure medication), cholestyramine (for a sleep disorder), clonidine (for an eye infection or inflammation), dapsone (used for fever-related problems), diphenhydramine (pain reliever), diethylpropion, fluphenazine (antihistamine), hydroxyzine, isoniazide (sleep aid), ketoconazole (antifungal), levetiracetam (muscle relaxer), meclizine (chronic insomnia drug), nimodipine, phenytoin (diet pill), rifampicin (rheumatoid arthritis medication), selegiline (diuretic used to treat hypertension), tricyclics (blood pressure pills), tetracyclines, and steroids (medications for osteoporosis). There are many possible side effects of these medications. It is important that you discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor before taking any of them.

2) For people using some of these medications as part of their treatment for asthma, there has been a report of a worsening of symptoms when they stop using these drugs. This may be due to a change in the chemicals that are now being metabolized by the liver. Therefore, it would be best to continue the treatment as prescribed unless symptoms worsen. If symptoms do not improve after a few days of stopping one or more of these medications, then it could be time to discontinue the use of this class of medications altogether.

3) A study published in 2006 showed that adding calcium to aspirin reduced the risk of severe heart attack in middle age men who had already developed high blood pressure. However, no such benefit was observed among women or younger patients; rather, the addition of calcium increased the likelihood of experiencing a serious adverse event related to high blood pressure. Some researchers suggest that low doses of vitamin D may reduce the impact of aspirin on cardiovascular health in older individuals and should therefore not be used routinely.

What are some of the physical signs/symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder?


There is not just one type of physical symptom that may indicate someone has BPD. The following list provides examples for each physical symptom, along with possible explanations why they might be present in the person with Borderline Personality Disorder. While every situation is unique, these descriptions do provide a starting point from which to examine the physical signs of BPD in a particular case.

Heart palpitations (palpitations are involuntary rapid heartbeats)

Fever

Nausea and vomiting

Anxiety or nervousness

Feeling tired or worn out

Short-term memory problems

Sleeplessness or insomnia

Body tremors

Chest pain

Headaches or migraines

High blood pressure

Trouble sleeping

Constipation

Weight gain

Fatigue

Vaginal dryness

Abdominal cramps or bloating

Pimples

In rare cases, there may also be psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety, self-harm, paranoia, substance abuse and other interpersonal disorders. Please note that this is only a brief summary, which does not capture all physical signs and symptoms associated with Borderline Personality Disorder. You should ask your mental health professional if he or she can explain any of the more common physical signs and symptoms that may occur when you have BPD.

We will work closely with you to develop a plan of care that's right for you.","Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a complex, chronic psychiatric condition that can lead to severe mood swings, self-destructive behaviors, and loss of control. A person with BPD has patterns of unstable or intense emotional responses to life events, including romantic relationships, work problems, family tensions, rejection from friends/family, financial difficulties, environmental stressors, etc. People who have BPD feel that they are not capable of feeling anything except anger and fear, and that their feelings are all too real and painful, often for years on end. Most people with BPD struggle with the following three core symptoms:(1) an unstable, intense emotional response to normal everyday experiences;(2) persistent feelings of emptiness/happiness/loneliness;(3) inappropriate use of words or phrases.(4) Excessive guilt or shame in response to negative emotions.(5) Impulsivity or reckless disregard for safety.(6) Irritability (may be intermittent);(7) Inappropriate, destructive behavior such as uncontrolled anger, irritability, trouble sleeping, difficulty concentrating, acting out, reckless driving, substance abuse, promiscuity, eating disorders (including anorexia), and sexual promiscuity.(8) Extreme changes in temper, body language, mannerisms, speech, or other aspects of personal appearance.(9) The inability to enjoy one's own thoughts, feelings, activities, and surroundings.(10) Repeatedly experiencing devastating setbacks (often culminating in significant losses).A person with BPD may also experience extreme distress about being unable to control his/her moods, whether due to mood dysregulation or depression. For example, someone with a history of severe BPD may be so desperate to avoid abandonment by loved ones that he/she will ignore evidence of abusive behavior (such as bruises) when present.People who live with BPD suffer greatly because their interpersonal relationships are constantly at risk of ending, and often because their moods swing rapidly between extreme happiness and extreme sadness. Even if there was never any violence involved, people living with BPD frequently report that they were abused as children, and that this experience traumatized them and shaped how they view themselves and others.People with BPD also often report that they often find it difficult to trust others, especially close family members. Some have been accused of stealing money or even assaulting their siblings or parents. Other relatives may accuse them of having ""crazy"" ideas, being unhinged or unstable, or simply making up stories about what happened during childhood.The intensity","""not yet known""B: no DSM-IV criteria C: DSM-III or -IV criteriaD: DSM-IV criteriaE: not specified F: nonneurotic personality disorder and other disorders.

What is the treatment for BPD?

For most people with Borderline Personality Disorder, there are effective treatments available. Treatment may be brief (with a short course of psychotherapy) or long term (long term psychopharmacological and behavioral therapies). Patients can also benefit from medication (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRI's] or tricyclic antidepressants[TCAs]) in addition to psychotherapy. Medication should always be used carefully to avoid adverse effects on both the patient and the caregiver.

3. What is the clinical course?


a) First episode : episodes typically occur in adolescence or young adulthood, usually with onset before age 18. The majority of patients are socially withdrawn, introverted and have a poor sense of self-worth; they may be prone to being impulsive and engaging in risky behaviors (eg, substance abuse). They experience profound dysphoria, depressed mood and an overall feeling that life has no meaning. Bipolar I disorder is characterized by at least one manic episode occurring twice per year for 3 months, followed by a hypomanic episode lasting 2–6 weeks. Patients can have psychotic features, including hallucinations, delusions and/or paranoia. b) Second episode : some bipolar I patients continue their illness up to midlife. Others experience remission during middle years. In the past two decades, many patients treated for bipolar I disorder with lithium therapy experienced a second major episode. c) Third episode: most patients with bipolar I disorder relapse as adults. However, about 5% of patients do not complete a full recovery and become chronic relapsers. These individuals commonly suffer from depression and other mental health disorders, which include substance use disorders. d) Persisting disability due to mood instability: approximately half of patients will eventually develop severe psychiatric morbidity such as depressive episodes and suicidal ideation. Some studies have found that those whose first episode was a partial response, and who subsequently enter a new phase of disease, are less likely to die prematurely than those without a history of mania or subthreshold episodes. e) Recurrence after hospital discharge : up to 30% of bipolar I patients experience another episode within 6 months of leaving hospital. f) Long-term sequelae : many people with bipolar disorder live with residual depressive symptoms for their entire lives. g) Cognitive deficits : mood swings disrupt cognitive functioning (ie, thinking processes), increasing risk for impaired educational performance, career failure and interpersonal difficulties. h) Risk factors for suicide: current or previous suicide attempts or self-harm or unstable relationships. i) Risk factors for bipolar II disorder: having had any lifetime major depressive episode, family histories of bipolar disorder, multiple personality disorder, conduct disorder, or schizophrenia. j) Other psychiatric comorbidities: substance dependence or substance misuse, obsessive comp","CASE REPORT

Description:


In the summer of 2002, a 23 year old woman presented to a general practice complaining of having recurring nightmares, hallucinations, hypervigilance, and severe anxiety. She also had severe depression, which she described as ""a constant feeling that something terrible is going to happen"". The patient was initially treated with antidepressant drugs but then relapsed into her former patterns of behavior. Her parents were unaware of this previous history but were supportive of her decision to seek help from her psychiatrist in August 2003. A thorough interview and examination revealed no abnormalities on any clinical exam. There was no evidence of suicidal ideation or plan or intent to harm herself.


The patient's symptoms began after one month of regular employment in a sales position. Although she did well professionally, her job involved many tasks in repetitive daily routines without breaks for rest or recreation. She often felt overwhelmed by the amount of paperwork and required supervision by managers who did not always understand what she needed. She reported an increasingly difficult time maintaining her self-control when faced with social situations where these routine demands interfered with her ability to concentrate on tasks.


Over the next several months, she became more anxious and depressed, but could never find reasons why her problems continued despite her efforts to change behaviors. After returning home from work, she spent","BPDs, NOS

Q: BPD or NOS?\nBPD is an acute emotional disturbance characterized by a pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, alternating between extremes of idealization (inflamed self-esteem) and devaluation (despair). The major symptom for BPD is the presence of at least three of the following:

• Involvement in multiple dysfunctional relationships.

• Use of aggression to resolve interpersonal conflicts.

• Impulsivity.

• Irritability and anger problems.

• Psychoticism.

• An inability to tolerate frustration.

• A history of childhood sexual abuse or trauma.

• Inappropriate, intense feelings of guilt, shame or worthlessness.

• Suicidal thoughts or behavior.

• Affective instability due to mood swings.

• Behavioral inhibition.

In addition, some people with BPD are hypersensitive to rejection and have difficulty tolerating criticism and may be extremely jealous and possessive of those close to them. Others may develop delusional beliefs about being victimized or abused. If these individuals become severely depressed, they will resort to self-mutilation, self-harm, or other self-destructive behaviors, such as drug use and suicide attempts. They also often act aggressively toward others. Because of their impulsiveness, antisocial behavior and tendency to engage in destructive behaviors, they frequently engage in criminal activities such as shoplifting, petty theft, fraud, vandalism and violence. Also known as Borderline Personality Disorder (Borderline Personality Disorder)

Q: how can someone know if they may be suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder?

A: The symptoms that make you suspect that you may have BPD include:

Impulsive behavior

Feelings of emptiness

Difficulty controlling impulses

Feeling isolated from others

Suicidal thoughts or actions

Having frequent thoughts about death/suicide

Ego dysregulation

Dissociative identity disorder - feeling detached from your body

Psychosis

Mood swings that can last days, weeks, months, years

Trouble staying on task

Self-destructive behavior

Depression that lasts many years

Extremely vulnerable to becoming dependent on others

People who have not experienced a chronic traumatic event can't identify with or accurately understand these signs of distress; it's not always easy to distinguish between mental illness and other disorders. Sometimes it"

Cancer risk factors that increase the likelihood of receiving a high-risk biopsy; these are not included as part of our model but can be used to evaluate how much additional information we have on each patient's specific risk. In addition, some of these risk factors include a history of recurrent cancer (including advanced prostate cancer), high BMI, diabetes mellitus, family history of breast cancer, history of testicular germ cell tumors, low IGF binding protein 3 or 5, serum ALT level, and serum lipids (ie, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL). These risk factors do not necessarily increase the risk of recurrence; however, they may result from an increased incidence of new cancers over time, which could influence future treatments. The number of risk factors is presented below for the following populations: African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, American Indians/Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians/Other Pacific Islanders, Middle Easterners, and Whites/Non-Hispanic Asians. This table contains the results of the multivariable models with and without data for all available variables. To generate these tables, all variables were first entered into the statistical program SPSS version 19.0 using descriptive statistics to create summary statistics such as mean values, standard deviations (SDs), p values, and proportions. Variables not present in any of the regression analyses were excluded. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results: During a median follow-up time of 8 years, 565 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer; 462 underwent treatment, and 683 received at least one radiotherapy treatment (Table 1). The five most common indications for therapy were radiation to distant sites, radical prostatectomy, and/or chemotherapy. Among all cases, there were no differences between those treated with surgery versus radiotherapy or radiation alone. Survival after diagnosis was similar among both groups (Table 2). Compared with those treated with radiation alone, survival with either surgery or radiotherapy appeared to be worse overall but not within subgroups defined by grade of disease, Gleason score, location, age, Gleason score and treatment group. There was no significant difference in survival according to risk factors of interest (e.g., PSA level, family history of prostate cancer, PSA concentration, serum total testosterone level), although the results differed depending on whether data from men in the entire study population or only those whose cases were matched to control groups were used. In addition, men undergoing early radical prostatectomies had an increased likelihood of dying than did those treated by conventional methods, whereas the latter's mortality rate actually decreased as their tumor size diminished.

Comment

In this large prospective cohort study, compared with those treated with radiotherapy alone or when combined with radiation, radiation plus chemotherapy proved to be equally effective in preventing recurrent prostate cancer. Although several possible explanations could account for such a result, including improvements in patient compliance and improvement in response to treatment, none are likely valid. We speculate that, in a setting where the probability of being diagnosed is low and prognosis is good, more aggressive treatment strategies may be justified. Indeed, our results suggest that aggressive management should be considered for men who do not respond well to radiotherapy alone or if they have poor response to conventional therapy. The observed benefit of radiation plus chemotherapy over radiation alone can probably be attributed to improved outcomes in cases with localized tumors or with high-risk subtypes associated with multiple risk factors (e.g., PSA levels). This combination approach appears particularly appropriate given the fact that many other types of cancers commonly encountered in clinical practice","overall survival (OS)

RESULTS OF THE INTERVENTION

The following are the estimated numbers and characteristics of patients who received the study drug during the 4-year follow-up period. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in age, race/ethnicity, sex, Gleason score, presence of metastases, clinical stage at diagnosis, grade, and years from diagnosis to death. For all outcomes except incidence of prostate cancer death, there was a significantly greater proportion of patients receiving finasteride compared with placebo. The proportions of men treated for low PSA level (<5 ng/ml), PSA > 5 ng/ml, positive laboratory test results, and clinically localized disease were not different among treatment groups. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels increased significantly over time and decreased more slowly in the finasteride group than in the placebo group. After the 4 year observation period, 65% of patients on finasteride had been rerandomized into placebo; the rest remained in finasteride treatment as before. No difference was found by race/ethnicity, sex, Gleason score, or baseline PSA level. Finasteride caused increases in serum testosterone concentrations up to 2 years after randomization, whereas estradiol concentrations did not change. In most analyses, finasteride increased prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels significantly above those seen with standard therapy. Although higher mean serum testosterone concentrations were observed in both groups, finasteride did not increase total testosterone concentration (Table 1). However, in a subgroup analysis that included only men with high PSA level (>5 ng/ml) and biochemical evidence of malignancy, finasteride dose was associated with an increase in total and free testosterone concentrations which reached statistical significance for the overall analysis. The addition of other drugs also influenced the changes seen, particularly for finasteride. The addition of tamoxifen, cimetidine, clomiphene citrate, warfarin, and antiandrogenic therapy showed no effect on any of these parameters. TABLE 1.

Cancer patients with a D score of >10 were classified as having metastatic disease, while those who had D scores <10 had an increased risk. This analysis was adjusted for age, Gleason grade, number of prior primary breast cancers, and previous chemotherapy. The 95% confidence interval is given by the following formula: \[(1-PCE)^(SE) = C(0.05^3) + C(0.01^2) + 1 + C(0.001*4) + 1\] where PCE represents the probability of death during follow-up; SE is the standard error of estimate.

Sensitivity analyses

The results of sensitivity analyses that compared psaO concentrations measured by HPLC to those measured by mass spectrometry yielded the same conclusions as the original study (Table 2). The main limitation of these studies was their inability to distinguish between different classes of psaO. It was possible, however, to detect differences in concentrations of psaO among the various classes based on HPLC. In the pooled data, we observed a 3.6 times higher concentration of psaO in tumors whose tumors had been treated with radiotherapy than in the other","outcome breast cancer\nB: outcome cervical cancer\nC: outcome lung cancer\r

S. M.: results are reported in terms of percent changes from baseline (ie, baseline PSA level=0). Data are adjusted for age, race/ethnicity and other risk factors such as smoking history, family history of colorectal or ovarian cancer, body mass index, education, alcohol intake, physical activity and hormone use at baseline, menopausal status, diabetes mellitus and estrogen replacement therapy at baseline. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC) except where otherwise stated. In addition to the study-specific variables, we used a composite variable that included all variables that showed an association with total PSA response, including PSA dose, duration of testosterone use, number of years since start of testosterone treatment, and menopausal status. To investigate whether the observed differences between groups could be attributed to the fact that there was no difference between men taking testosterone alone and those who took both testosterone and DHT, we performed analyses separately on subgroups defined by length of time taken to achieve testosterone levels above 5 ng/dl (<1 yr), frequency of first oral doses (>5 times per week), and dosage at which initial serum concentrations of DHT were below 10 pmol/L (<20% of men). For each combination of these characteristics considered, we computed the median change from baseline in each group compared to the mean change among controls. Statistical significance was set at α = 0.05. The same analysis was also performed on women without a family history of breast or prostate cancers.

Results We enrolled 394 subjects from the National Cancer Institute–sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial. Of this population, 240 had received placebo, and 40 had received testosterone enanthate. Among those randomized, 191 were treated with testosterone enanthate; 91 completed the full 12-month course. At the end of the treatment period, 74% (140/191) of the treated men were still alive, and 46% (106/190) of control participants were alive. Median follow-up time was 13.8 months (range 1-64). During the first year after randomization, 81% (102/103) of the treatment group experienced statistically significant decreases in PSA, whereas only 49% (57/104) of the placebo group experienced increases (P <.001).

DISCUSSION The results of our meta-analysis support previous reports on a positive association between prostate cancer risk and serum testosterone levels.8 However, it is unclear whether high serum testosterone concentrations are causally associated with an increased risk of developing prostate cancer, or if high testosterone concentrations may be protective against developing prostate cancer. Some studies have reported that low-grade PCa patients with elevated serum testosterone concentrations had lower Gleason grade at diagnosis than did their counterparts with normal plasma testosterone concentrations.7 One plausible explanation for these observations could be that elevated serum testosterone concentrations result in decreased expression of PSA in early stage PCa. It has been shown in vitro that low-grade PCa patients can produce up to 10% less PSA than do healthy men.4 This reduction in expression of PSA, which causes a decrease in PSA secretion and thereby decreases PSA production, may protect against prostate cancer development. In addition, one study demonstrated that PCa patients with higher than normal serum testosterone concentrations showed reduced tumor growth rates compared with those with lower serum testosterone concentrations (Figures 1 and 2), thus supporting the hypothesis that high serum testosterone concentrations might confer protection against prostate cancer. On the other hand, some authors have argued that PSA testing should not be used to diagnose early stage prostate cancer because of its potential to affect the endocrine system.18 Although some researchers suggest that PSA levels are not helpful as predictors of the presence of prostate cancer,3,12 there remain many questions about the effects of low-grade PCa on the endocrine system. Serum testosterone concentrations in patients with PCa vary greatly, ranging from 0 to 20 ng/dL. There have been few prospective studies comparing the effect of different concentrations of testosterone on prostate cancer risk. As suggested by earlier studies,9,14,15,19 the level of serum testosterone that seems most favorable is estimated to be around 10 ng/dL.20 Therefore, the following question remains unanswered: Are there any adverse consequences associated with high versus low serum testosterone concentrations?","prostate-specific antigen; %RBC: red blood cells.

Pilot studies of chemotherapy and HER-2 mutation status in breast cancer survivors

The most recent pilot study was conducted as part of the CAR-T clinical trial led by Dr. Vipin Parekh [14]. It involved 101 adult women with breast cancer and an original positive Herceptin® result from a mammogram. The investigators had initially hypothesized that those who developed Herceptin®-positive tumors were more likely to develop breast cancer recurrence compared to those who did not have a positive HER2-result on their initial mammograms. They followed this up with a second study to determine if HER2-mutant patients in this cohort also experienced increased rates of breast cancer recurrence. This latter study confirmed these findings. Although the overall rate of recurrence for HER2-mutants is only 15% versus 40%-60%, in HER2-negative cohorts it can be as much as 60%. Thus there is strong evidence that certain cancers are caused by mutations in one or both copies of HER2, which may predispose them to development of other types of cancer or even cancer recurrence.

Drs. McGovern and colleagues (2014) performed a case series of 22 patients with newly diagnosed nonsmall cell lung carcinoma who were treated at the Johns Hopkins Hospital between 2005 and 2012 with the FDA approved trastuzumab for their initial treatment. All 22 patients had been initially evaluated using an aggressive regimen of surgery alone or as part of a standard adjuvant chemotherapies regimen. The study included two time points during which all 22 patients had received their first trastuzumab dose; one time point was a postrandomization follow-up period in which patients continued to receive their primary therapy (surgery), and the other time point was when they stopped receiving treatment altogether. The median age at diagnosis of both the tumor site and the underlying lung disease ranged from 41 years to 65 years. In addition, five of the patients had previously received another chemotherapy drug. At baseline, all 22 patients reported having smoked on average for 19 cigarettes per day since adolescence and 15% stated that smoking affected their daily activities. One patient began smoking before he developed the disease and seven others reported that it was only after diagnosis. Patients had no significant prior history of immunosuppression including systemic steroids or any other type of immunotherapy. A total of 16 patients were taking interferon beta. Trastuzumab was started at a mean starting dose of 1 mg/kg per month (range 1–10 mg/kg per week). Patients were followed up for a minimum of four months after starting treatment. On average, half of the patients completed the entire four month observation period, whereas about 30% had a relapse, leaving 17 patients (53%) still alive at the end of the observation period. Based upon a Cox proportional hazard model analysis, 18% of the patients did not die within the year following randomization. Of those who died, 11 patients dropped out due to adverse events (including 2 deaths); three more withdrew due to death (2 deaths each). During the observation period, patients received trastuzumab approximately every six weeks at an increasing dose of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg every three weeks. At the end of the observation period, 26% of the patients showed progression of the tumor at least one step further than their original tumor grade according to the NCI graded algorithm for lung cancer, while 32% of these patients also experienced progression by three steps in comparison with","no or incomplete response (stage IV); B: partial response (stage V); C: complete response (stage VI)

Stage III

Prognosis for patients with stage III disease is poor. Treatment options are limited by the lack of effective treatment options and the high cost of standard therapies. The majority of patients who develop metastases in this group continue to progress and ultimately die from their condition.

Treatment Options

The following treatments can be used as adjuncts to chemotherapy to slow progression. There are currently three drug classes approved for these conditions, known as PD-1 inhibitors.

PD-L1 inhibitor therapy

These drugs bind to a receptor called PPARgammaR, which regulates cellular energy production (such as glucose, fat metabolism). These drugs work by blocking the ability of PGC1α to produce these proteins. In turn, they cause cells to stop producing them. This has been shown to prolong survival by up to 14 months when combined with pembrolizumab (Keytruda), a PD-1 inhibitor that works primarily through PPARalpha activation. Other drugs have also been developed as PD-1 agonists, which allow more than one binding site for the compound to activate.

Other PD-L1 inhibitor therapies include:

Pembrolizumab, Keytruda, Aricept, Tecfidera, Gefitinib and Erenumab

Climactin (Gemzaril), Mevacor (Mevacor) and Trastuzumab

Sirolimus

Ustekinumab (Kineret)

PD-2 inhibitors

PD-2 inhibitors target another gene in the pathway that leads to cell death. They act in two different ways. One acts directly on cancer stem cells and inhibits angiogenesis; the other kills tumor cells that do not make enough PD-1. Some of these compounds block the PD-1 pathway in addition to inhibiting the growth factor receptors on cancer cells. Because there are several PD-2 inhibitors available, they must be combined to achieve full clinical benefit.

Two major groups are taking advantage of the antiangiogenic effects of PD-2 inhibitors to improve outcomes for patients with solid tumors. The first group consists of two companies – Akzo Nobel Pharmaceuticals (Alimta) and Novartis/Biogen Idec (Soliris) – that are developing PD-2 inhibitors that","no, nB: yes, p value for interaction >0.05 (log-rank test).

Among all participants (including those receiving irradiation only), there was one case of nonfatal myelosuppression, seven cases of fatal myelosuppression, four cases of metastases, and two cases of serious adverse events related to radiation therapy that did not result in death (Table 2). Of the 11 cases of nonfatal myelosuppression (the most common complication associated with this class of treatments) reported in our cohort, three occurred within 24 hours of the initial dose.

DISCUSSION

In this large study, we describe what is likely the largest series of observations ever done on mortality and survival following single doses of ionizing radiation therapy. We have obtained results consistent with previous studies in which patients had more than five sessions of irradiation.2,3 In contrast, our data provide evidence that the magnitude of benefit increases with increasing exposures. This pattern has been previously described by others using data from different populations but does not appear in our data because we included individuals who underwent multiple exposures to ionizing radiation over an extended","mortality 1% (1/101) B: 5% (6/100) C: 10% (11/99) D: 30% (31/96) \r

In order to make clear the distinction between two subgroups that may be described as ""no-treatment"" and ""palliative-care"" groups, we used an ordinal scale from 0 to 5 in which 0 represents no treatment and 5 represents palliative-care intervention. The numbers in the parentheses represent the maximum number of people to whom this particular combination could be administered. In all cases, a group containing three or fewer people was designated as no-treatment. The first stage of treatment consists of a single dose of methotrexate to kill off most cancer cells; then, after 6–8 weeks, it is followed by another round of palliative-care measures including intravenous fluids and low doses of corticosteroids. The last dose of palliative-care drugs is given about 3 months after the second treatment phase. Figure 3.

The aim of this study was to assess whether these two drugs were effective in increasing oestrogen levels and therefore reduce the risk of developing multiple primary cancers during their courses.

Methods Patients included patients who had stage 4 breast cancer diagnosed between October 2007 and July 2009. They received either tamoxifen alone (N=35) or combination of tamoxifen and doxorubicin (N=28). There was no significant difference in overall survival rate between groups (5·4% v 6·0%).

3. What do we mean by ""allogeneic""?

a. Allogeneic means that the patient's tumor cells are from a genetically identical donor or a closely related individual (e.g., sibling, aunt, uncle).

b. The most common type of allogeneic transplant is the bone marrow-derived stem cell transplant (BMST) procedure. The recipient's immune system recognizes and attacks these cells as foreign invaders, resulting in an anti-tumor immune response. These transplanted cells can then be used to treat various diseases. For example, patients who have leukemia use BMSTs to help their T-cells attack the disease. Patients with other types of cancers also may receive allogeneic transplants. In general, allogeneic transplants can result in a very high remission rate (80%–90%) compared with typical chemotherapy regimens. For more information about how allogeneic transplants work, see ""Bone Marrow Transplantation"" under Surgery.


4. How does breast cancer treatment differ for those whose tumors are triple negative?

a. Triple negative breast cancer has three major components. First, it starts at one location on the body—the breast—and spreads to many different areas of the body through lymph nodes (lymph nodes usually contain multiple small organs called plexuses). Second, it is known as HER2-positive because it expresses the HER2 protein on its surface. This protein causes healthy white blood cells to destroy any abnormal cells, and this process is part of the standard cancer treatment. Third, triple positive cancer often has aggressive spread to nearby organs like bones, kidneys, or lungs. Some patients need surgery to remove some or all of their organs.

b. The first step in treatment is the decision to begin chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is considered effective if it kills 95% of the cancer cells within 5 weeks and destroys 99% within 10 weeks. However, chemo drugs must continue indefinitely to kill off all of the remaining cancer cells. A combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy is sometimes prescribed, but surgery is generally recommended before the second round of chemo is administered, since surgery will allow for more time for all the cancer cells to die off after each administration. Most patients need 1–2 cycles of chemotherapy and then 2–5 rounds of radiotherapy. If chemo fails to cure the cancer cells completely, patients will need additional rounds of chemotherapy to achieve complete eradication. Many women choose surgery after","a highly aggressive form of metastatic breast cancer, most often affecting younger women. Treatment with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation is used to shrink the tumor while sparing healthy tissues; these treatments are also called adjuvant therapies.

Stage 3/4 lymphoma

Treatment is based on clinical symptoms, results of biopsies, imaging studies and a combination of treatments. There are two main types of metastases in this group – high grade and low grade. High grade metastatic cancers have the potential to spread through blood vessels, lymph nodes or bone marrow into other parts of your body including joints, skin or lung tissue. Low-grade tumors can become invasive and need surgery and radiation to treat. If you have early stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas such as ALL and other forms of T-cell lymphoma, it may be possible for your doctor to decide that surgery isn't needed at all and that a targeted chemo protocol will do more harm than good. This usually means using only one or two drugs over several years. You'll continue your usual care once you're no longer receiving treatment and should follow the doctor's instructions closely.

What is adjuvant chemotherapy?

Adjuvant chemotherapy can help people who already have cancer but aren't responding well to standard therapies. Adjuvant chemotherapy uses medicines that don't cure the cancer but can still make the cancer less aggressive and give you some control over its progression and side effects. It is given just before starting any new medicine to get an idea of how quickly things are progressing and what other treatments might work better. This information helps doctors choose which drug is best for each person.

Are there different types of adjuvant chemotherapy?

There are many types of adjuvant chemotherapy available today and these vary depending on the type of cancer they are used to treat. They may also differ slightly between manufacturers.

Some examples include:

Cisplatin, a form of platinum that has been shown to kill most types of cancer cells with few side effects;

Pomalidomide, another platinum compound that works by blocking the enzymes responsible for making proteins involved in cell growth;

Rituximab (Keytruda), a protein that targets a special protein found in certain immune system cells that are common among patients with chronic illnesses like rheumatoid arthritis.

Where can I find out about adjuvant chemotherapy?

Many local health authorities","The chemotherapy, the surgery and the radiation.

Q: What are the risks of breast cancer?


The side effects from treating breast cancer depend on the type of cancer.

Women with early stage breast cancer may experience a few temporary problems such as pain during menstruation or headaches, but these problems usually fade within 2 months to 1 year.


However, more serious health issues can occur when women undergo treatment for late stage breast cancer. These include infection (sepsis) and bleeding.


Other side effects may also be experienced by some people who have undergone the same breast cancer treatment. This includes skin changes, liver problems and heart disease. Although it is not known which specific factors cause these side effects, they tend to happen most often in people who had chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. For example, in addition to skin disorders and blood clots, other possible reasons include:

- infections caused by bacteria in the body's immune system;

- tumors that grow more slowly than normal;

- damage to nerves that affects how the brain communicates with muscles (paralysis);

- increased risk of diabetes mellitus.","Inappropriate (e.g., a non-clinical condition), b: Not suitable for the patient, c: Not supported by evidence

Stage 3/4 breast cancer treatment\nA: Inappropriate (e.g., an experimental drug or procedure) or not suitable for the patient (for example, if there is no history of breast cancer).

The term ""not adequate"" refers to any clinical trial that has been found inadequate on at least two different grounds and where one of those grounds was either that it was too expensive or lacked sufficient power, or had insufficient quality control measures, data extraction and analysis. These trials do have to be published in full as well but are not always deemed not adequate. The European Medicines Agency guidelines for assessing the adequacy of clinical trials of new medicines state that a study cannot be judged satisfactory if its primary outcome (the number needed to treat [NNT]) is less than 20% higher than expected.

In addition, a trial can only be concluded that does not meet these standards if it is described as being unblinded or with selective reporting of outcomes. In some cases a small proportion of patients might receive alternative treatments or may be excluded from participating because they were considered unsuitable or did not comply with the protocol or safety precautions. However, such trials are usually regarded as having met all the required pre-specified criteria and therefore their results are generally accepted as sufficiently reliable to support claims made about a given medicine or procedure.

Where clinical trials were performed outside Europe and have findings for other countries they should also be reported in this way (see section 8 below).

2.1.5 Clinical trials carried out overseas

Clinical trials carried out outside the EU are subject to similar standards as those set for clinical trials within the EU. They are entitled to a licence to provide research services under the conditions laid down in Article 5(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001. This means that all clinical trials carried out outside the EU, including overseas, must follow the same safety and efficacy requirements and adhere to the same restrictions on the use of human subjects as apply within the EU. All studies involving human participants must report compliance with EU regulations relating to informed consent, information gathering, protection of volunteers' rights and confidentiality, the handling of blood and tissue samples and the collection, storage and destruction of biological specimens.

And then she woke up and it was like she had this head cold, but she thought it was just me. Then after that day, she would wake up every two hours screaming for hours, crying. So, I think it could just be an underlying problem. But you know, I have a really good night's sleep now; that was actually one thing that helped me feel better. And the pillow-neck thing, it was something that came as sort of a surprise to me because I had never heard about any pillows or anything, so that was quite interesting to find out.

Q: if someone did come into your house and they wanted to rape you will there be a big reaction? A: (laughs) Well, I don't know what kind of reactions it might generate from people. It depends on how violent you are. If I went around to the streets saying ""Do you want to fuck me"", or I go around saying ""Are you going to fuck me"" you'll probably get some responses, but if you say ""You've got to die tonight"" or anything like that, it doesn't matter who you are – you're probably not gonna be believed.

Q: Do you have any advice for women who want to learn more about their sexual anatomy? A: I think this is one of the most important things in life. Because sex education has been left to teenagers. You know, children should be taught about these things. They shouldn't be scared off by all the euphemisms which doctors use, the terms that doctors use like ""vagina"", I think those are completely inappropriate. You'd think that doctors would give them proper terminology. I mean they have to understand that this isn't a word that we used in the past, and it is only used in medical contexts, but if that's the case, why do you even need a diagnosis label on the box? Why don't you just call it what it is? The same thing goes with intercourse. You know, the vagina is a very intimate part of the female body, and most people seem to forget that. We've forgotten that ever since Freud, and we are still trying to put Freud back in his place. Anyway, that","Yes, I guess. Q: What is the worst pain you have had? A: Oh, it would have to be my shoulder pain. It was the most painful thing ever! And then there's the back pain from sitting so long on an airplane or something. But that's about as bad as they got for me. Q: Anybody else that has this problem? A: Yeah, I think it's because of stress and stuff like that. In high school, I used to do a lot of jumping up and down on the basketball court just to get through the day. Q: Who in your life do you consider your role models? A: My parents; my mom definitely. She taught me how to work hard and be a good person. She always encouraged me to try new things and try not to take no for an answer. I think she kind of made me into who I am today. Then obviously my older brother [Rico]. He was my role model growing up. When he came home with a new pair of shoes, if it wasn't perfect, he'd throw them out. He'd say, ""I don't need these,"" and he'd go get another one. That showed me, even though it was only a couple years ago, how important it is to want what you want and be true to yourself and keep pushing through anything.

Sleep apnea is a medical condition in which breathing repeatedly stops or slows down while you're sleeping, causing your throat to close up during waking hours. These pauses in breathing can last from seconds to minutes and could affect a person's ability to wake up and breathe normally at night. Common symptoms include difficulty breathing during sleep; difficulty breathing when awakening; snoring; rapid or irregular heartbeats; gasping for air; yawning; and chest pressure that increases with deep breaths. Most people have no more than two episodes of sleep apnea per year.


Sleep apnea can lead to serious problems, including: Heart attacks Heart attacks occur after repeated episodes of apneas. When someone has stopped breathing repeatedly for some time and their heart rate drops, they may experience a heart attack. The chance of having a heart attack as a result of a sleep apnea episode is 1 in 30,000. The risk of death due to heart disease (cardiovascular diseases) is around 1 in 3,500. In people with underlying heart conditions, the risk rises to 1 in 20. People who develop sleep apnea often stop exercising because it makes them tired, but exercise can be very beneficial for sleep apnea sufferers. For example, regular, slow walking can help reduce apnea-related daytime sleepiness, so people who have trouble getting a good night's rest should regularly walk or bike to bed. But regular exercise can also make it harder to fall asleep later at night and increase how long it takes before you feel sleepy again. Walking helps to relax you, making you less likely to have an episode of sleep apnea. It also reduces daytime drowsiness because you're moving around. It's not possible to know what effect exercise will have on sleep apnea until we try it out for ourselves. If you're concerned about exercise or want to start doing more of it soon, talk to your doctor. This may prevent the need for further testing or treatment.

It was a lot easier financially at first but now, it's hard because of my career, there aren't as many jobs for us to go to anymore.

Q: What does being a father mean to you?A: I take a lot of pride in the fact that I'm a good husband. I help raise my family; I love my kids, they are the stars of our lives. It makes me feel very lucky to be able to do what I do and be a part of their lives. Being a parent means a lot to me.

Q: what's the worst experience you've had during your career?A: Some crazy things have happened to me throughout my career but nothing too serious. Injuries are always an issue but overall I feel great.

Q: how did you come up with your ""Tiger"" nickname? A: I don't know if I ever thought of it that way. I just remember seeing Tiger Woods' name in magazines or anything like that. I've been around Tiger Woods for a long time. Whenever there's a photo shoot where he's wearing some kind of uniform or he's out somewhere promoting something, he'll often talk to me by saying, ""How ya doin, buddy?"" So I used those words over and over again for a while and I kept doing it. After my daughter was born, I started using it more on social media.

Q: what is the biggest regret you have from your career?A: I","This is a good question. The key to dealing with your back pain that's causing the most problems for you right now isn't so much what type of pillow or mattress you're using, but rather how and where you're sleeping on it! The first thing we do when waking up in the morning is get out of bed and stretch our bodies out to ensure they are fresh from sleep. Then we take a walk around the block until we have all day energy left. Our bodies need time to fully recover from sleep and not only will this help reduce tension in your back but it will also prevent stress-induced cramps, which can cause permanent damage to your spine. You should try stretching as many times throughout the day as possible to make sure your muscles are as flexible and strong as possible during the rest of the day. You may want to start by doing some simple stretches every hour or two like these ones here.

Step 3: Take an Epsom Salt Bath \nB: We love taking baths because it helps us relax and rejuvenate. If you don't know about Epsom salt therapy, it's kind of like having a hot steamy bath without the burn. Epsom salts dissolve calcium deposits in your body which makes them less likely to lodge and become hard spots later in life. For example, if you haven't been getting enough exercise then you might be prone to osteoporosis later in life. This would be prevented by taking a daily Epsom salt bath. One teaspoon of Epsom salt has about 1/4 teaspoon of sodium chloride and it helps keep your skin hydrated. It won't remove toxins from your system as long as you take care of those first. Soap is great for soaking in, but if you're not comfortable with doing this or are worried about the soap damaging your skin, there are other ways to detoxify that work just as well. Here are some ideas on how to do one yourself...

Step 4: Get More Sleep \nA: Sleeping more will go a very long way towards helping relieve pain. Many people who suffer from chronic back pain tend to feel ""stuck"" at night. They aren't able to fall asleep easily and instead are constantly struggling to stay awake during the early hours of the morning. There are tons of ways you can combat this, including using your alarm clock when you wake up so that you don't have to fight against your own body's natural circadian rhythms. However, once you get going, sleep will come to you faster than ever before","Best pillow neck pain is a type of shoulder discomfort. The pressure points (spots) on the head and neck may cause soreness, tenderness and/or swelling as well as pain. The best way to treat this type of pain is through massage therapy with good results.

Q: which body part is prone to back pain?A: Back pain occurs in all parts of the human body but it's most common in the lumbar region. It can also occur at any point on your body where there is an imbalance between muscle groups such as muscles in your neck, shoulders, upper arm or upper legs. The location of your back problem depends upon your age, health history, genetics and posture. Some people have more pain than others. This could be caused by bad posture; poor sleep habits; obesity; physical injuries; or medications such as anti-inflammatories or pain relievers.","pillow pain is the most common, but there are other types too. Some of them include: - Pressure point headaches - Neck stiffness \nB: it can be a very annoying condition if you have it for more than two weeks in any week. This may lead to headache and numbness on one side of your head \nB: this is also called subluxation and often results from long term pressure on your brain that doesn't go away after a few days or even weeks. - Headaches with chest pain - Spinal tension \nB: this can be caused by many different things, including stress, repetitive strain, tight muscles, excess sleeping etc. It's usually treated easily. The symptoms can be quite severe though and in some cases you can have seizures.


What is the cure?


CURE: If you're diagnosed with neck pain then chances are you'll try everything that comes into your mind. You could get treatment for those conditions mentioned above, you might have surgery done to try to relieve your neck pain. Or maybe you'll just ignore it and hope it goes away on its own. But how can it? When we compare it to a disease like cancer, which is extremely hard to treat once started, it becomes clear why we should try to stop our bodies' natural reaction to pain. We must work as fast as possible to remove the cause of it and find an effective solution to the problem. Once this is achieved, we no longer need to worry about pain anymore and will actually feel better.","the worst.

Q: what is the best weight loss pill?\nA: I have not heard of any pills that work well for this problem and I am not willing to give up my beloved Vyvanse yet. I do know it does help with stomach aches though...I've never used it for any other issue and have tried a lot of different things (caffeine, kratom, etc).

Q: how long will you stay on your current regimen and what do you think about the results?\nA: I plan on staying on it until at least December 2017 or until I die. I have been taking Vyvanse (300 mg) twice a day for the past year and I still feel like crap. It's hard to explain why, but they really didn't make me feel better with just my mind. The physical side effects are pretty bad as well, so I'll see if I can get off them by switching to some other drugs or supplements. When I'm finally ""off"" it will be amazing.

Q: will you continue to take any drug even when you're not under the influence?\nA: No. If there was something in here that made me feel more alive or less suicidal after going without it I would consider continuing, but honestly, nothing has helped me. I don't want to live forever, so why take that chance? Plus, this method works way better than anything else available right now (that's why we were searching for an effective way to reduce cravings).

Q: How often should I go back to sleep?\nA: I suggest trying to stick with your normal schedule and getting a good night's rest every once in a while to prevent insomnia problems from happening again. There isn't much point if you're already having trouble sleeping anyway!

Q: Have you had any side-effects since quitting?\nA: Not that I remember so far.

Q: What are the most common side effects?\nA: Tinnitus, headache, nausea, dry mouth, insomnia, depression, difficulty concentrating, confusion.

Q: Would you recommend this method? A: Absolutely!!! You deserve to find out if you truly need these medications and see if there are cheaper alternatives. We've talked about the benefits of switching to a healthy diet and exercise program before so why would you pass those strategies up now?! This method works very well and I highly encourage anyone who wants to take","Pillow neck is a very common neck problem. Most people will experience some slight stiffness in the neck during sleep, but most won't have any problems sleeping with it. A lot of people are prone to neck strain after long periods of sitting for extended periods, so when they lie down to rest their necks are being stretched out by the weight on them. This can cause pain and discomfort if not addressed properly. The most effective way to treat pillow neck is to reduce your risk factors for developing it, such as high blood pressure and obesity. If you're already suffering from it or know someone who does, make sure that you take steps to improve this issue before it becomes more serious. It's easy enough to solve pillow neck headaches. Try using an anti-sway pad, which can be purchased at many sporting goods stores. An over-the-counter medication called Advil (acetaminophen) may also help relieve symptoms by relaxing muscles. For chronic problems like neck spasms, chiropractic manipulation (neck rollers) may be the solution. Make sure to ask your doctor about which type of therapy might work best for you. When it comes to neck pain, it's important to find relief quickly. Take care of your head now so that it'll always feel comfortable and secure, and avoid putting unnecessary pressure on your back.","I've got a real hard time remembering the last time I had a pillow neck pain.

Q: what is the best part of having bad posture? A: The fact that you can actually see yourself getting thinner with each day of poor posture! But seriously it's fun being able to laugh at those comments all day long.

Q: What is the worst thing about being weak in bed? A: Being exhausted from the effort every night when trying to sleep. It gets even worse if you sleep on your stomach or side and sleep like 10 hours straight

Q: numbness and tingling of extremities? A: Pain at the site of the injury(s), pain or tenderness (especially in the fingertips) on the side of where the skin was torn. This may be worse when moving the affected area. The symptoms are usually felt more often than not, but can also occur rarely. Q: swelling and redness A: Itching, burning, blisters or crusting of the skin that occurs for no apparent reason. There could be small areas of reddening that heal without scarring (red spots).

Q: difficulty walking? A: When you have had an eye injury, you may experience difficulty with balance, coordination, or locomotion. Do not allow yourself to fall down from a great height or try to jump over anything large; these activities might cause further damage. Q: muscle weakness/weakness? A: Weakness of one or both legs, particularly those of the lower body, caused by decreased strength in that particular leg due to the loss of blood flow due to the eye injury. Some people report that this type of weakness only affects their left leg or both legs. However, many patients will report that they feel weak in both legs as well. Sometimes both limbs may appear weaker than usual. For example, when doing something such as walking up stairs, one's leg appears to bend in an unusual way (e.g., bent knees). This inability to walk normally may persist even after treatment has been completed.

Diagnosis of ME/CFS","My left hand is in a cast. Do you think the injury to my finger could cause long-term nerve damage?

B: No, no, not at all. It's only a little swelling on it and I have to keep my fingers taped for now. The MRI showed a small tear of the ligament but that was repaired before it got any worse so there should be no lasting effects.

Q: What type of surgery did they do?

A: They put a screw in your thumb and then they moved onto the other finger. I had them cut down to the bone as far as possible and then put two screws in. Then I just went home and waited until everything healed up.

Q: Does the pain get better with time? How much does it hurt to play baseball?

A: It's pretty bad when I first go out there because I am still playing catch with the same glove. But once my muscles start getting stronger I don't really notice anything. I have gotten used to it so I can deal with it.

Q: Did you feel like this would happen to someone else?

A: Not really. We're lucky enough to live near the hospital and we are close by friends and family. There were a few people who came to visit us every day even though I didn't want to talk to them. I know that if something happened to me right now I wouldn't see them again.

Q: You started training for your first Ironman in 2002. What are your current plans?

A: I am still racing every year but not on the weekends.

I'm currently running 6 hours a day and doing the long runs as fast as possible. When you're doing that you get tired very quickly. Running 25 miles in 3 hours gives you such a good pump that you don't feel like you need to stop.

What is Hypothyroidism?

Hypothyroidism is an underactive thyroid gland that can lead to a number of serious complications including heart failure and depression. It affects millions of people around the world, especially women, because many do not receive adequate treatment.

Symptoms include fatigue, weight loss, lack of energy and feeling cold. These symptoms can lead to sleep disturbances, muscle weakness, poor coordination, memory issues, and difficulty concentrating. In some cases, hypothyroidism causes severe problems with blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, sweating, and cognitive function. The symptoms usually begin within the first few years after diagnosis.

If you have hypothyroidism, you will need regular treatment for life. Your doctor will work with your family physician to determine if there are any other contributing factors to this condition.

How Common Is Hypothyroidism?

The majority of people are born without a functioning thyroid gland. If it is too small, it cannot produce enough hormones needed by the body. However, there are several types of hypothyroidism. Symptoms can vary from mild to life threatening.

Primary Hypothyroidism

This type of hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid produces abnormal amounts of hormones, but the brain does not recognize them as being abnormal. This condition is often called ""primary"" or ""latent."" Primary hypothyroidism is associated with decreased fertility, breast cancer risk and heart disease risk. About 1 out of every 100 babies worldwide has primary hypothyroidism.

In the United States alone, over 2 million adults are estimated to be living with hypothyroidism, while another 30 million children and teens have the condition.

Secondary Hypothyroidism

Some people inherit a less effective version of the thyroid hormone than normal, resulting in secondary hypothyroidism. This causes an abnormally high amount of thyroid hormone to be produced, causing health problems like high cholesterol and","depression symptoms\nB: fatigue/fatigue-related symptoms\nC: sleep problems, including insomnia\nD: mood swings.\r

""We will evaluate the patient's response and severity of illness to determine if there is a need for further evaluation or treatment."" The hospital also offers a number of other psychiatric services, including counseling, therapy, and group psychotherapy. It accepts Medicare and Medicaid and can provide additional services at no cost, such as mental health evaluations and treatment. For patients who do not have insurance, however, the clinic is willing to perform home visits and refer them to community organizations that offer medical care and social support. One in five people with untreated thyroid disease are unaware they have it.

The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) provides funding for a wide variety of research into heart attacks, strokes, congestive heart failure, diabetes, obesity, stroke prevention, cancer, heart attack victims' families, and other diseases affecting American adults.

If you feel you might have a heart attack, call your doctor right away!","symptoms that are due to a deficiency of thyroid hormones, such as low energy or weight gain. (see hyperthyroidism)

DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT:

Patients with mild to moderate hyperparathyroidism have no obvious signs and symptoms. However, if the condition is severe it can be treated with treatment with medication. The most common cause for this diagnosis is Graves disease, which causes progressive bone loss and leads to an increased risk of osteoporosis later in life. Patients with normal thyroid function also may develop osteoporosis, especially those who exercise excessively. Thyroid hormone replacement therapy reduces the body's production of the abnormal protein thyroxine by stimulating the body to produce more of the hormone thyroxin. This means that patients will not lose bone mass but the bones will be stronger, reducing their chances of breaking a leg. If your doctor suspects you might suffer from hypothyroidism, he or she should do several tests to rule out other conditions causing a similar symptoms, and evaluate your general health before prescribing treatment. Tests include blood samples, an electrocardiogram (EKG), a physical examination and a urinalysis, to measure levels of thyroid hormones, total cholesterol, triglycerides and a complete blood count (CBC). Blood work can determine whether there is evidence of organ damage caused by iodine toxicity, or if a person has had thyroid cancer. Your doctor may also order a PET scan, an x-ray of the chest, to check for abnormalities of the heart muscles.

TREATMENT FOR HYPERPARATHYROIDISM:

The goal of treatment is to lower TSH so that it reaches its target level of about 2.5 mIU/l while maintaining normal amounts of thyroid hormone in the bloodstream. Most patients respond well to a combination of a thyroid drug and lifestyle changes, or to two drugs taken separately. Some doctors use the same combination once daily, others take them every 4 hours. The dosage is usually changed according to the type and severity of the illness. For mild cases, all medications together may be given once daily; when the disease is severe, different medications must be used at intervals ranging from 1 week to 6 months. There is little difference in the side effects between these doses.

If you experience any unusual symptoms such as dizziness, headache or numbness after starting treatment, stop taking your pills and consult your doctor immediately. You should continue to follow your normal diet and supplements.","thyroid disease.

Q: does it affect my sex drive?A: yes, but not with any great frequency (probably less than 1% of the general population)

Q: is it really a mental illness and should I seek help for it?A: no. It's a medical issue that needs to be treated through medication, and therapy if necessary. In fact, there are various types of hypothyroidism available in the USA and Europe. There are two main subtypes: Hashimoto's type (a benign condition where your body produces too little thyroid hormone) and Graves' disease type (an autoimmune reaction). A few more types exist, but the majority of people who suffer from low T fall into one of these two categories.


The treatment for hypothyroidism is to take medication. The doses vary depending on the severity of your symptoms, and you will need to discuss this with your doctor. You also may need to use special dietary supplements like Armour Thyroid or DHEA-P to boost the level of thyroid hormones in your system. If necessary, surgery can also be used in some cases. Your doctor will advise you on whether to get surgery or not. Surgery is very painful but it has many benefits. Hypothyroidism results in reduced bone density and weak muscles, so it's important to make sure that you have enough strength to do work around your house or perform strenuous physical activities.","thyroid disease symptoms or both?

B: Both.


* The following questions are based on our experience in treating patients with primary hyperthyroidism, secondary hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism:

1. I have been told that my symptoms were caused by a condition called ""primary"" hypothyroidism (where the body does not produce enough thyroxine). Is this true?

The most common cause of low blood pressure is hypothyroidism, which can lead to sudden episodes of severe dizziness or loss of consciousness in young children and older adults. Symptoms may include:

• Unusual feeling of heaviness (vomiting, faintness), confusion, fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, irregular heartbeat, rapid breathing, sweating, muscle aches.


2) Restlessness, irritability, nervousness. These are not only signs of hypo-thyroidism but also of other diseases. Also, a child with poor concentration, trouble reading or writing, difficulty speaking, inability to sit still for long periods of time, and speech impediments may experience these changes as well. Some kids have trouble sleeping because they're tired all the time; others find it hard to concentrate because they become restless during class.

3) Increased appetite, weight gain and/or obesity. This is caused by an underactive thyroid gland producing too much iodine. In addition, children who don't eat enough tend to put on weight. Kids with Hashimoto's disease often have excessive hair growth, skin pigmentation, wrinkles around their eyes, enlarged lips, swollen glands inside their noses, and acne. Their facial features also change drastically, becoming more angular and less rounded than usual. As their bones get weak, they develop osteoporosis. Thyroiditis and lupus are two disorders that may increase this problem.

4) Mental problems. Some people feel confused, depressed and hopeless, even though there isn't any evidence that their brain chemistry has been changed. They might worry about getting sick again. Others feel anxious or anxious about making mistakes that could lead to injury or illness. All of these reactions usually go away when your doctor treats you with an antidepressant medication. Most of them disappear once the thyroid hormone levels are normal.

5) Weight gain. This is sometimes linked to eating too many carbohydrates (like candy and sugary foods), too many fat foods, dairy products (especially milk), and alcohol. You should avoid foods like potato chips and pastries, cookies, cakes, ice cream and soda pop. If you must eat sweets or fatty food, limit yourself to no more than one piece at a time or to less than 200 calories per day.

6) Low sex drive and fertility. This can be due to insufficient estrogen production or an imbalance between testosterone and progesterone. A woman's fertility is affected by her menstrual cycle","thyroid conditions that cause fatigue, depression and other mental health issues.

Q: how do I know if my doctor is using a new drug?


A: If your doctor tells you he or she is switching to a new medication or supplement, ask for the new package insert. This will tell you what each medicine does, including how long it lasts (how long it takes to work) and how much it costs. Also check the label on all products. It's important to know which ones are safe to take, because some may not be.


The labels of many supplements can say they contain ingredients such as calcium, iron, vitamin D3, omega-3 fatty acids and zinc. But these can also have dangerous side effects. In particular, eating fish rich in DHA and EPA — known as oily fish — may reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. Fish oil pills, however, cannot provide this type of protection.


It's also important to understand what drugs work well together. For example, progesterone cream taken after surgery may help stop bleeding, but it won't prevent clotting. And some antibiotics don't work as well with each other than when used separately. Ask your doctor which drugs might benefit from combining."

This first cohort consisted of 772 women who were taking oral contraceptives when they began the study in their early twenties. In the second cohort, which included 394 women taking hormonal contraception, the mean age was 24.9 yr and the median duration of continuous hormonal use was about 2 years. For both groups, the prevalence of abnormal semen quality, defined as less than or equal to 10 x 106/ml, decreased steadily with time after discontinuation of oral contraceptives (P<.0001 for both). A decrease from 19% to 5% for the oral contraceptives group is statistically significant compared with 7% for those on hormonal contraceptives. Among the oral contraceptive users, an increase in sperm counts occurred during the first year of follow-up, whereas the corresponding decrease remained stable ( ). Because this was not expected, we performed analyses separately by age group to determine if there were differences in sperm concentrations between the oral contraceptive users and the hormone users.

What are the benefits to my health if I use condoms?

If you have sexually transmitted disease (STD), the health risks from condomless sex may be reduced by using condoms. Condoms reduce the risk of contracting certain STDs such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. A study conducted in 1995 showed that women who were not currently having intercourse had a higher incidence of Chlamydia compared with those whose sexual activity included vaginal intercourse. [2]


Condom use has also been shown to decrease the risk of HIV infection. According to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) there is no scientific evidence to indicate that it increases the risk of acquiring HIV. The NCHS recommends against the use of male latex condoms because they do not protect against all viruses, bacteria, or other substances that can cause HIV transmission. Condom use protects both partners during vaginal and anal intercourse; however, it does not protect against genital herpes.


The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) concurs with ACOG's guidelines regarding condom use.[3] In particular, the ACOG recommends the following when using condoms for the prevention of HIV/AIDS:[4]

Use only one condom per encounter, unless there is a medical reason for more than one condom. Condoms will not prevent HIV from entering the body through the penis, vagina, anus, mouth, eyes, or other openings in the body. For these reasons, condoms should not be used with receptive oral sex. Use lubricant on the outside of the condom to help reduce friction between the man's skin and the woman's skin and prevent penetration; this may make it harder for the man to put a condom on correctly.

Use multiple condoms for every sexual encounter, even if both partners are HIV positive, since the virus survives on surfaces for up to 24 hours after ejaculation. Although most people who have unprotected anal intercourse won't become infected, others have been infected and can transmit HIV to their partner.

Consider an STD testing service or health clinic prior to each new sexual relationship. This way, you know what to expect and can take precautions before","high dose of cyproterone acetate

Fetal exposure to androgens can have effects on the developing male fetus. The most well-studied is hyperandrogenism, which occurs in some children who receive prenatal hormone therapy for conditions such as Turner's syndrome or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Hyperandrogenism may be detected during a routine physical examination at age 2 years by measuring serum testosterone concentrations. In girls with CAH or TS, abnormal levels of FSH or LH are frequently found. At present, there is no specific test for hyperandrogenism; however, it has been shown that FSH alone cannot distinguish between true hyperandrogenism and benign secondary hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

Other potential sources of androgen exposure include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs used in chemotherapy, oral contraceptive pills, corticosteroid use and other medications used to treat disorders of sex development. Androgens also increase the risk of breast cancer. Pregnant women should avoid taking any medication that contains norethisterone acetate, since this compound causes early puberty. Testosterone replacement therapy increases the risk of prostate cancer and other cancers of the reproductive system, including ovarian cancer. It is advisable to discuss all medical and family history with an endocrinologist before starting treatment with any hormonal agent. Women treated with progestins should not resume intercourse until after they reach menopause. If using tamoxifen (brand name Provera®), discontinue if pregnancy occurs while taking the drug.","low.\r

Other pregnancy tests, including the following are not indicated for use by women taking any form of hormonal contraception. These include the basal thermometer and LH-FSH test, which measure ovarian activity:

Pap smear, vaginal cytology (vaginal fluid), or cervical cytology (cytological smears) may be used to detect noncancerous abnormalities. This includes changes that do not appear on a Pap test.

The most common abnormal findings on cervical cytology are cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, an abnormally shaped gland at the back of the cervix, or adenocarcinoma in situ.

Cervical biopsy is performed when noncancerous cells have been found during routine screening for cancer. A small sample is taken from around the outside of the cervix using an instrument called a speculum and is examined under a microscope. The type of abnormal cell present depends on whether it's cancerous or normal.

When should I get my blood work checked?

During your period, you may feel tired and have difficulty concentrating. To help avoid these symptoms, talk with your healthcare provider about how often you need to take your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, glucose level, and other vital signs. Your doctor will ask about your medical history and also request several laboratory tests as part of your regular follow-up visits. If you experience any side effects, call your healthcare provider right away.

Questionnaire for Menopausal Hormone Therapy–Women's Health Program

In this questionnaire menopause symptoms were assessed as described above. The questionnaire also included questions about the following: history of previous vasectomy; age at which first had a vasectomy; how often vasectomy was performed and why; and whether the procedure was done before or after menopause. For each participant, all vasectomy-related questionnaires were reviewed by two physicians who had no financial interest in the study. Questionnaires were returned to us in February 2003, and data collection was completed by March 2004. This paper reports results from the overall survey. In addition, we analyzed four subgroups of participants with a median age of 64 years on the basis of whether they had received hormone therapy and the year of first treatment with hormones. Of these women, 75% did not report an indication for hormonal contraception prior to undergoing their vasectomy. All other groups were divided into three groups based on duration of use of hormones during their lifetime and type of contraceptive method used. Women who reported taking oral contraceptives, long-acting reversible contraception pills (LARCs), intrauterine devices (IUDs), implants, injectables, transdermal patches, vaginal rings, microgels, vaginal ring implants, vaginal suppositories, female condoms, male condoms, spermicide and hormonal IUDs were considered to be postmenopausal, whereas women using hormonal IUDs and injecting methods such as implants, microgels, and vaginal ring implants were considered to be premenopausal.

Some popular ones are clarinet, guitar, bassoon, saxophone, banjo, ukulele, trumpet, drums, shakers, tambourine, etc. Some people have their own versions of these instruments; I'm not sure about everyone else. However there is one common method of playing any of those that seems to work everywhere: Put the ""strings"" onto your finger and use your thumb/forefinger as a pick. You'll notice it's very easy to play such a stringed instrument! Many other instruments are based around this simple concept too. For example, you could play the drum using just one finger, or the cymbals would go into your mouth from either side if you were so inclined. Q: How did they learn how to use their hands? A: They didn't. When we were babies, our parents taught us basic motor skills through touch. In fact, every child starts out learning how to walk right away. But then we get older, the muscles in our bodies start developing, and the development slows down. That's when our teachers started teaching us how to move using our minds and some basic hand movements. Of course, this was before computers came along and we began teaching ourselves everything from how to operate them. Then we stopped learning, but now we're having children again.

Q: where can people find your music?A: http://www.youtube.com/user/sophiebethmckinney A: I'm sorry, but I just started uploading my albums. They aren't very good quality (it's actually a joke). If anyone wants to use the song as their ringtone or whatever, it'd be great if you could tell me about it so that I can add it into the album.I also have an official fanclub at http://www.fanmail.org/~thesoulofpenny. I'll probably put some more stuff there in the future. My phone number is [masked]. I think you should read this message: ""The only thing we agree on is Penny. She's the best.""Q: What does 'the soul of penny' mean to you?A: It means that she's extremely intelligent, kindhearted, and caring. She doesn't take no shit from anybody and never gives up. She's incredibly loyal to her friends and family. She can hold a grudge even though she didn't make any effort to hurt them. That type of person is what makes the world go round.Q: I hate myself sometimes. Why am I like this?A: There are many reasons why you feel depressed. The main reason that people seem to fall victim to depression, whether it's physical or mental, is because they're not listening to their bodies. You need to listen to yourself first before you try to listen to anything else. Keep going outside and see if you feel better inside.Q: How do I get over someone who isn't nice to me?A: Try to understand why they dislike you. Are they angry with you because you did something wrong? Did you leave a mess in their house? Did one of their parents die? Ask yourself these questions instead of trying to figure out what they hate about you. Maybe they like your personality but you made them mad by acting like a jerk.Maybe they were angry with you once but now they realize it wasn't worth getting pissed off about.Q: Where can I get support?A: First things first -","goggles for swimming\bO: glasses for driving\cP: sunglasses\dO: eyeglasses\e: earplugs (in case you have no ears)C: camera or binocularsD: flashlightE: whistleF: flashlightG: torchH: radioI: phoneJ: calculatorK: compassL: mirrorM: phone bookN: penO: small keyP: keys (if you have more than two)R: plastic bagS: pocketknifeT: scissorsU: lighterV: paperweightW: knifeX: pencilY: rulerZ: tape roll \*: extra batteries. Each car will contain a different battery. Some models may also include a spare. The last few digits of the VIN are your mileage!

Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) are not unique to any given vehicle and may be obtained from various sources, including manufacturer's websites. For example, I purchased my '94 Toyota Corolla with a VIN #1B040162 from an independent dealer in New York City.


The most common way to obtain a VIN number is by purchasing a used vehicle. A dealer will often issue one if it is found that the previous owner has a damaged VIN. However, the number does not guarantee a genuine Toyota. Many dealers will only accept a VIN as proof of ownership and cannot sell you a new one unless you purchase them on their behalf. If you wish to buy a vehicle from a dealership, take the following steps to ensure that you get the correct one:


Ask what is ""the problem"" with your car. Ask whether they know how much mileage the previous owners had.


Find out exactly what model the dealership bought. Do not just ask about one particular model; ask whether there is a specific model of car to which they were referring when selling you your car.


Check the odometer reading. Most dealerships offer this service free of charge.


After you've determined which model the dealership sold you, talk to other dealers who dealt with them to confirm that the same problem was present at each location. You may need to search local classified ads looking for similar cars that have been reported stolen. In addition, check the internet for reports of vehicles being listed as having been taken off-lease or sold without proper documentation.

<Gag> oh, and the other thing is that I was just wondering if we can get a good image on it, but this will be too much work since there's no camera. The only way to see the whole thing would be to actually film the whole thing, which in itself is kind of pointless.


Anyway, thanks again everyone! There are a few things that I forgot to mention. One question though. Is it possible to put an optical filter through the lens?


Secondly, how do you know where to focus when the screen is so small? That may not be very important, but i like to have something around the screen for reference.


Thirdly, how do you compensate for the blurriness? It seems you should be able to move the camera back and forth to achieve some semblance of depth, but the quality of your footage depends heavily on the position of the subject. If you're trying to cover a large area with one shot then you need to make sure the subjects don't pop out or jump off the screen. In short, we're looking at a pretty complex setup here.


I'm also going to assume that you want to capture video of someone else filming their own face - how do you go about doing this without them knowing? You could simply try and hide your camera behind the person who has the face you're shooting (which would look even worse) or perhaps you'd like to take advantage of a little trick known as ""live view"". To use live view, hold down the shutter button until it automatically selects a different focal length. This way you can shoot the entire scene in front of the object you wish to record from. You might notice that in the picture above that the background in the foreground has moved slightly towards me because I've used the live view feature to adjust the focal length."

Curls for the shoulders are also very useful. The following is a list of curl exercises that may be helpful to you:

The next exercise I'll discuss in more detail is the Pinch Press. This exercise can help relieve pain in both of your shoulders. It helps to release pressure on your head from the back biceps tendon by pressing on it with a small amount of force. As a result, the bicep becomes stronger, which makes things easier for you to do other pressing motions like bench presses, curls etc. If you find yourself having trouble performing some of these movements because they feel too painful then try using this exercise as well. You will notice that as soon as you start feeling any discomfort at all just relax and hold the position for 5-10 seconds. It's important not to let the resistance go down too much and keep an even tension throughout the set. Make sure not to raise your hands above chest level while doing this exercise. You should maintain perfect balance and form throughout the whole movement. To perform this exercise do 3 sets of 8 reps with 85% of 1RM each set. Do 1-2 sets per day. For example:

Monday:

1x20 pinches (8 total) + 2 x 10 pinches (15 total) + 1 x 8 pinches (25 total) + 2 x 12 pinches (35 total)

Tuesday:

I am not here to tell you that these are all symptoms. They may be different signs, but they're all related to your body's response to stress. So what can we do about it? It is important to understand how much stress we put on our bodies when we engage in activities like running long distances, for example. This will help us determine whether we need to get some exercise so that our bodies have more time to heal. If we continue to run long distances without giving our bodies enough rest, we'll undoubtedly suffer from injuries.

If you find yourself with chronic anxiety problems, you might want to consider talking to a physical therapist who specializes in treating individuals suffering from chronic anxiety disorders. Physical therapists work closely with their patients to prevent and treat chronic conditions, such as arthritis, headaches, and depression. Your mental health care professional will also assist you with managing your overall stress levels, including learning coping strategies that allow you to remain calm during stressful situations. In fact, many people feel better after working through psychological exercises like mindfulness meditation.

When it comes to preventing and treating chronic conditions, it is often difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of an illness. That being said, there are a number of things you can try, starting right now! You don't have to go it alone! By following the tips below, you will likely improve your quality of life and eliminate your anxiety symptoms.

Get Plenty of Sleep

Sleep deprivation is one of the biggest killers of humans. Not only does sleep deprive your brain cells of vital nutrients, it can also impair memory. When your mind isn't able to process information at night properly, you experience vivid dreams. But instead of sleeping in terror, it is possible to prevent nightmares by getting adequate sleep each night. According to The Huffington Post, getting eight hours of uninterrupted sleep per night is enough to keep you awake longer than someone who gets just four. In addition, it helps regulate mood and reduces irritability. Getting plenty of rest throughout the day is another good way to reduce anxiety. Keep track of your total daily sleep time each week. Make sure you are getting enough sleep, especially between 7 p.m. and 8 a.m.

How To Do The Squat Routine

The exercises described above are a good starting point for anyone trying to improve their squatting technique. Here's how I personally go about training the squat; it's based off an exercise I first learned from the great coach John Grimek. His program included squats as part of the warm-up for every workout. This was because many people were not accustomed to performing squats on non-conventional surfaces such as box springs or mats (yes, I know, it sounds weird). As a result, they didn't have any idea what to expect when doing squats on these surfaces.

However, over time, people began using these techniques correctly. In addition, it became increasingly common to see coaches incorporate squatting into their programs for their athletes. So while squats were still only used as an eccentric movement in most cases, they now made up almost half of the warm-ups we performed at the beginning of our workout.

In other words, if you want to make real gains in your squatting performance, I strongly recommend incorporating them into your warm-up routine. You'll notice that the barbell will typically be lower than you would normally be using when you perform the squat. That is because by doing the exercise properly, you are teaching your body how to handle heavier weight without having to increase its strength all together. It is much easier to teach a muscle to contract harder when the load is light rather than heavy.

Below are some of the basic movements that I prefer to use when doing squats during the rest days of a regular workout. You may decide that some of these exercises aren't appropriate for you due to various reasons. However, if there is someone out there who needs more help with these exercises, please let me know. My goal is to provide everyone with an excellent, effective training plan so that they can maximize their potential in the gym.

If you really","a technique for stretching the back of your neck, shoulders and upper arms. It is also called ""Curls and Stretch"". In this exercise you will get a great stretch in your back but it's not a good idea to do this on a daily basis since it can cause some pain at first when doing this exercise. You might need to make sure that you are comfortable with this before starting.

This stretching exercises is helpful if you have tight muscles around your throat area, especially in your head. This allows for better breathing because more air gets into your lungs without strain. It helps to improve your throat flexibility and tone.

Wrap your hands behind your back like this:

Now pull your right arm slightly down and away from your body. Hold it there while straightening the left arm by pulling the elbow towards your chest.

Do this same thing to your left arm holding the wrist close to your chest.

Continue doing these movements.

Repeat the same motions with your other hand until you feel the muscle tighten up and then release it back into the position.","Shoulder stretches for the neck, shoulders and arms. These exercises can help relieve tension in these areas. These are also a great way to strengthen the muscles of the back as well as stretching them out. They will make you feel so good!

Foam Roller Massage

This is a classic and has been proven effective when it comes to relieving stress, improving posture and reducing pain. This method involves rolling a foam roller around various parts of the body, like the feet, ankles, hips, knees, chest and abdomen. Start by rolling the outside of the thigh and knee joint. Next move along your inner ankle bone, through the hip flexors and then down into the groin area. You'll find that you're not going to have to roll much farther than this to begin to notice benefits. There will be some initial discomfort, but after only a few minutes of treatment you should start to see some improvements in posture and reduce any pain associated with muscle strains. The best part about this technique? It takes literally no time at all to do. All it requires is a pair of comfortable shoes and a foam roller. You can even use a small tennis ball for extra pressure if you'd prefer. For more information, check out our article Foam Rolling for Pain Relief.

How To Do It: Begin by lying face up on your bed or chair with your palms flat on the floor. Roll a large square piece of soft foam rubber across your calves and knees until you reach your ankle bones. Continue moving downward until you reach your knees and hips. Finally, roll backward to create a 90 degree","stretching the neck. B: stretching the shoulders. C: stretching both arms at once \nB: to stretch both arms in front of you simultaneously.

131,Q: exercises for better posture\nA:,"general information on the human body

The second group of studies focused on muscle training. The focus was not just on strengthening muscles, but also on learning how to modify them so they do what you want them to. This is a major aspect of weight training that many people don't know about.

For example, if you're interested in gaining size and strength, there are several different methods you can use (for example, single-joint movements and compound movements). For each method, you have to develop an understanding of the body's structure, as well as its function. When we train for strength and muscle mass, we're essentially trying to change how our bodies make decisions with regards to moving through space, which ultimately affects the way our muscles work. We need to be able to learn how these systems operate and adapt to new situations before doing anything more advanced.

These two types of studies were very important because they taught us a lot of things. One thing I found surprising was how much people changed their behavior after working out—not only physically, but mentally and emotionally too. They started seeing themselves differently, as well as other people. It seemed like exercise changed how people viewed themselves in all sorts of ways.

One study involved studying some men and women who had been obese prior to starting the program. What happened? Over three weeks, they were asked questions such as ""How often do you think your life will get better or worse?"" and ""Are you satisfied with yourself right now?"" After three weeks, their answer to both questions dropped by around 30 percent. In fact, when asked this question again after 12 months, only one in four participants reported being unhappy with their lives. That means they felt happier and more positive than they ever had previously, something unheard of in most studies of how exercise affected health and wellbeing. And it didn't stop at self-image; they actually saw increased productivity throughout their entire company!

Another interesting study looked at how long it took people to feel better. It compared obese individuals who had lost 10 pounds at the beginning of the study to those who hadn't done anything before. Those who did the extra workouts ended up feeling significantly better within six days, whereas those who didn't got back into shape faster—meaning the initial workout gave them a boost. So, rather than losing fat, these people were creating muscle.

This research has opened up the door for people to take control over how quickly they burn off fat—and gain muscle. In my own personal experience,","yoga\nB: stretching\nC: meditation (with or without a teacher)

The shoulder girdle muscles include biceps brachii (the muscle on top of the arm), levator scapulae (a thin band at the back of the shoulder blade) and pec major (front deltoid).

The shoulder girdle muscles are responsible for keeping us upright, especially when we're sitting. They are also involved in maintaining our balance and controlling our body movements. In fact, a study done by researchers from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center found that people who regularly perform pushups have better hand-eye coordination than those who do not. This ability to control one's own movement while maintaining bodily equilibrium allows them to be more efficient with their time, as well as more confident and alert.

This makes it difficult to get to full extension (and also puts too much stress on the lower back). Instead, try lifting the entire weight off of your hands while keeping your shoulders stationary. As a result, when you land, your body should be perfectly vertical – like if you were to do a front squat. You'll have the same amount of room to bend your knees as you would in a normal lift.

3. There are some specific exercises that help strengthen these muscles:

Posterior chain exercise: this involves twisting your spine around as far as possible while pushing your ribs out at the top of each rep. For example, if you're holding dumbbells and are performing an exercise known as a ""scapular depression"" where you hold them vertically with your arms extended straight and then twist and squeeze them together, try trying this instead. It's hard but can be effective.

Anterior chain exercise: perform a curl. Pull the bar away from your chest until your chin touches your waistband, and then begin to raise the bar overhead while simultaneously pulling the dumbbells towards your chest, starting just above your chest. Keep squeezing your upper traps and your scapulae as you go up and down. This activates the posterior chain – which is responsible for stabilizing the spine and reducing intra-abdominal pressure.

4. Also, try performing these exercises after working out your abs. Your abdominals don't need a ton of work, but they can definitely benefit from having a strong core. They're very important for controlling blood flow throughout your entire body, and many people believe that their abdominal strength plays a significant role in preventing injuries.

5. Don't forget about how you feel! I'm not suggesting that you stop training altogether, because it's really more important to focus on strengthening your mobility, flexibility, and overall health during your workout than it is to focus on your bodybuilding goals. But by making sure you do at least one exercise per","standing, sitting, lying down and walking. The first exercise is not a sit-up but rather an incline on the floor (this will help to prevent injury). Another exercise in this category is the ""push up"", where the body is raised off the ground by pushing with one arm. This works great as part of the core training programme!

Q: how much time can you spend on each exercise?A: 1 hour per day is sufficient. If your body requires more than that it's probably too much, so try to reduce the number of sets to 2 or 3, but keep them short as we don't want overtraining.

Q: do I have to be young to improve my posture?A: no, as long as you are at least 18 years old you should be able to achieve excellent results from the program. In fact many professionals say that older people can benefit from proper posture training as well. However, some specialists also advise against young adults doing routine yoga exercises because they may develop osteoporosis later on in life, which could lead to joint problems. It would certainly make sense to talk to your doctor if you want to know whether you need such advice before starting this programme.

Q: why should I train my stomach muscles?A: this group of muscles consists of all the ones surrounding your spine. They are responsible for keeping everything upright while eating; stretching these muscles will definitely increase your flexibility and your strength as a result. The stretches for the abdominal area are the same as those used for stretching the lower back. Do these movements with your legs stretched out straight out, like in the photo below.

Q: what about weight lifting?A: weight lifting is very important for improving posture; however, it isn't necessary for achieving good results. We recommend going slowly during the weight lifting sessions to avoid injuries, but we still recommend it as part of the overall programme.

Q: how do I strengthen my buttocks?A: this is another muscle group that needs strengthening to obtain optimal results. Situps are particularly effective for this purpose because they work both sides of the buttocks. Start with a few reps and gradually build up until you reach a maximum of 15 repetitions.

Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease that affects millions of people worldwide. It results from the body's immune system attacking healthy cells and tissues. The severity of psoriasis varies widely, but it often involves painful red patches on the face, scalp or limbs.


It can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic predisposition, environmental agents such as pollution and smoking, medical conditions, viruses and bacterial infections. Although psoriasis may appear to be a simple condition when first spotted, over time it can lead to more severe symptoms, including long-term pain, scarring and disfigurement in some cases.","headpats scalp psoriasis\nB: a.k.a., psoriatic skin disease, baldness, or receding hairlines on the hairline; b.k.a., scalp psoriasis\nc:\: scalp psoriasis\nsurvival \tirv-iv-3-'sar-,viv\ n : survival in hostile or toxic environment and esp. in battle; specij ; a person who survives an epidemic of smallpox in which up to 80 percent are killed by the disease — pso>ri*viC \'psr-e-nik\ adj psO're-ate \'pst-9-.rat\ vb [L pulsare, fr. pulsus pulse] vi 1 : to move rapidly 2 ; to be or become fast and vigorous syn see beat 3 : to go at full speed — pi'R^a'tion \pst-e-'a-shan\ n — pso<rai*tor \-,at-3r\ n ipso'rin \'psr)-e-,en, -e-sn\ n 1 a : any of various nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents used in medicine as analgesics, sedatives, and emetic agents; also % their metabolite b (1) : a drug that is a prodrug for another drug with similar properties (2) : one having such a chemical structure 2 : a substance that produces action upon itself (as by its own action) as a stimulus of its own development ; stimulant 3 : something that stimulates 4 : a product of rapid motion 5 I a device consisting of a piston driven by an impeller for imparting thrust to a boat 6 a : a mechanical instrument used in measuring the depth of water b ; a barometer 7 : a machine that makes a sound by moving two or more parts along a line and producing the sounds corresponding to those movements 8 : a device for stimulating or conditioning the nervous system 9 : an electric current from an external source causing stimulation and other reactions 10 : a signal given by an alarm clock indicating when the alarm will sound and informing operators of timeouts, breaks, or other occurrences 11 : an object, state, or occasion characterized by rapid change or transformation; esp : a condition marked by great activity and esp. by excitement 12 slang l a : a sudden violent outburst b : an exuberance of emotion 13 : an act or instance of pulsating 14 : a quick-tempered aggressive","head pats with soap on skin psoriasis\nB: scalp shampoo\nC: hair removal - a treatment for scabies and dandruff \nD: hair washing, shaving \nE: hair dyeing (hair dyeing is usually done in a hospital) \nF: hair transplantation (hair transplants are usually done at home) \nG: hair removal or waxing \nH: hair removal cream, gel, lotion \nI: hair dye \nJ: dye-free shampoo \nK: dyeing hair \nL: hair dyeing cream, gel \nM: hair coloring \nN: tanning salons \nO: hair removal \nP: hair removal products \nQ: beard/beard trimming \nR: haircuts \nS: haircaring \nT: electrolysis (electrolysis is usually done at home, the procedure can also be done in an outpatient clinic.) \nU: laser treatments \nV: botox injections\nW: wart removal \nX: plastic surgery \nY: plastic surgery (includes breast augmentation and nose jobs) \o0: any cosmetic surgery not included above

For example, there's no such thing as ""dishwashing"" but we call it cleaning our dishes so you know what we mean!","no, not at all. q: is there any evidence of a relationship between psoriasis and the use of topical steroids?A: It has been demonstrated that psoriatic arthritis does not occur in association with the administration of topical corticosteroids. However, it is possible that these drugs may be effective in some individuals who have psoriasis without an underlying inflammatory condition. In other words, they are likely to be more helpful if given as a second-line treatment for psoriasis (see section 4.8). q: why did the skin lesions disappear after discontinuing the corticosteroid medication?A: Although many patients experience relief from their psoriasis symptoms when the corticosteroid is stopped, in most cases this does not lead to complete resolution. At this time, we do not know whether discontinuation leads to permanent changes in the skin or in the immune system. If such effects were observed, it would indicate that the immunological mechanism of action was also modified.

4.5. Treatment of psoriasis by physical therapy and/or laser therapy Psoriasis is usually treated with antiinflammatory agents, which in turn cause exacerbation of the skin lesions. The choice of anti-inflammatory agent must balance its ability to produce adequate symptomatic control with its potential side effects, particularly allergic reactions and damage to surrounding tissues. Physical therapies such as massage, acupuncture, electrotherapy, phototherapy and laser therapy can be used alone or together with anti-inflammatory medications. Laser therapy is generally considered the preferred first line treatment, although combined treatments are sometimes recommended. Laser therapy is used primarily to treat superficial lesions but might also be useful in severe cases where deeper lesions are present (see sections 5 and 6). A systematic review found only one single study evaluating the efficacy of different levels of laser irradiation on the clinical improvement in psoriasis (Foley et al., 2002). There was strong evidence that 3 minutes of pulsed ultraviolet light at intensities ranging from 0.25–1 J/cm2 induced significant reductions in overall lesion counts (mean reduction 12%) but not specific disease areas. No adverse events were reported. Another small randomized controlled trial found no statistically significant difference in the number of relapses between those treated with 1 minute of pulsed UVB and those receiving a higher level of ultraviolet (mean relapse rate 19% vs 13%). In addition to using laser therapy, psychological interventions are often suggested as part of the treatment program. There is good evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce symptoms and improve","headpats scalp psoriatic lesions in the scalp A: Headpats Psoriasis Treatment Guide, 3rd ed (2005)

Treatment of psoriasis by using topical steroids

Psoriasis is treated with systemic corticosteroids. The aim of steroid treatment is to reduce inflammation and decrease the number and severity of flares which can be seen on skin biopsy or at periodic visits to the dermatologist for evaluation of the condition. These treatments should not result in a permanent reduction of symptoms but may improve the overall state of your skin.

Steroid treatment consists of the use of drugs that stimulate the body's immune system to destroy certain bacteria and fungi responsible for psoriasis and other conditions such as eczema. Steroids are used mainly to treat severe cases of psoriasis. Some people find it difficult to tolerate some of these treatments. It is important to discuss any concerns you have about taking an antihistamine before starting steroid medication. You will need to tell your doctor if you have allergies to aspirin or any other drugs, so they know whether the steroid should be avoided altogether during treatment. In addition, you will also need to inform them if you have high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, liver disease, or kidney problems. Your doctor or pharmacist will be able to advise you about this.

Topical steroid therapy is usually started one week before the next scheduled visit to your dermatologist. To prevent side effects caused by previous steroid exposure, your skin care professional may start you off slowly rather than abruptly. This allows your skin to get used to its new regimen.

To be effective, steroid injections into the skin are administered either subcutaneously, where the injection site lies under the skin, or intramuscularly, where the needle pierces the outermost layer of the dermis. Most topical medicines have a similar dose to be given subcutaneously. If you prefer an injection, then please refer to the specific product information provided with each medicine.

The most common steroid available over the counter or prescription is prednisone (Duroclofenac). Prednisone is a synthetic version of a naturally occurring protein, called human epidermal growth factor (HERF), which stimulates the growth of new cells in the skin and can help fight infection. This type of steroid has been shown to be more potent than natural HERF in stimulating skin cell growth in people with psoriasis who already have active lesions.

Treatment for Psoriasis/Acne

If you have psoriasis or acne, then you can use a combination of topical and oral anti-inflammatory medication to treat your condition. However, the choice is up to you as there are several different classes of medications that are available. Each class has its own set of benefits (which we will discuss later) but also has some disadvantages (such as drug interactions). The first thing to consider when choosing an anti-acne regimen is which type of acne you are dealing with. This can be tricky because it depends on what other symptoms exist in addition to the pimples and breakouts. Here's a quick look at the main types of inflammatory skin conditions and their treatment options.

Psoriasis

The most common type of inflammatory skin disease, this is basically a rash that develops around the hair follicles. It usually occurs under the arms where the skin is thinner. If left untreated, psoriasis can progress into more serious lesions such as abscesses, nodules, and cancers. In severe cases, it may even lead to death. While the cause remains unclear, one possible explanation is that excessive sebum production causes inflammation by damaging the cells lining the pores causing them to release free radicals that damage DNA and increase susceptibility to cancer. Anti-acne drugs such as minocycline, clindamycin, or erythromycin can help reduce inflammation and prevent any further progression into life threatening lesions. You should keep in mind though that sometimes these medicines will not work as well if you have been taking them for a long time. As you can imagine, using an anti-acne agent every day can add up quickly – so plan ahead with the appropriate frequency of usage.

Dandruff or Dry Skin

This condition is characterized by flaking, itching, dryness, and irritation caused by an overgrowth of bacteria that thrive in the environment. This imbalance leads to redness and itchiness around the face, neck, ears, and elsewhere. Acne treatments like salicylic acid products (the active ingredient in many shampoo brands), benzoyl peroxide (brand name Botox), and retinoids (also called Tretinoin) will all provide effective relief from dandruff but they do tend to exacerbate the symptoms of dry skin. To address both issues, choose an anti-acne cream or lotion to be used twice daily. For example,","ear/ nose hair treatment.

Worst case scenario, if you're not getting any improvement in your symptoms after 3 months of using a shampoo or conditioner containing tretinoin you can switch to an alternative product that doesn't contain retinol. If you are still experiencing some redness or itchiness after 2-3 months and it's bothering you then you may have tried too much too soon. The best way to get rid of this is by gradually reducing the amount applied at each weekly shower until you reach the lowest amount necessary for your skin type. For example, someone with oily skin might apply less than 15ml per week while someone with dry skin would use more than 60ml per week. This should help reduce the appearance of the redness and itching. After one month you will probably notice little to no effect from the product so continue applying the same amount as before even though there may be noticeable reductions in efficacy.

If you want to increase your chances of success you should use a more gentle cleanser which does not strip off the outermost layer of your skin like many commercial products do. The best option is the Clarisonic Cleansing Cloths. They don't irritate the skin nor do they cause break outs. Try them out first to see whether they suit your needs and whether you prefer their texture over the Clarisonic Scrub. It also helps to try to avoid cleansing during the night because they tend to clog pores. If you find yourself feeling irritated by certain products we suggest switching to one which contains other ingredients such as aloe vera, avocado oil, rosehip seed oil or shea butter.

Tretinoin is available through most pharmacies but can also be purchased online at www.theclarisscrub.com (affiliate link) or at any drugstores including Boots.
