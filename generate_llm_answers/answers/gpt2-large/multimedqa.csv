The following is a short list of some chronic diseases that can affect people on a daily basis.


Diabetes - Type 1 Diabetes

The primary goal of diabetes management is control of blood sugar levels within a specific range (usually 6 to 12 mg/dL) while maintaining normal or close to normal body weight. There are three types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. A diagnosis of type 1 diabetes requires a fasting plasma glucose level of at least 5.5 mmol/L. A fasting plasma glucose level of at least 7.0 mmol/L indicates an elevated risk for developing diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes typically live between 10 and 15 years after diagnosis. An average length of stay in the hospital with type 1 diabetes is six weeks. If your diabetes worsens during treatment, you will likely need to be hospitalized until the condition has resolved. In general, if someone who does not currently have type 1 diabetes develops type 1 diabetes, they usually experience an improvement. But, many patients develop long term complications from their disease, including heart failure, kidney damage, amputation, blindness, and other serious consequences. Type 2 diabetes is a much less severe form of diabetes. It results from the breakdown of cells' ability to release insulin into the bloodstream. Since this process is irreversible, it can result in dangerous organ dysfunction and death. With prolonged use of oral medication, these symptoms may occur. Some individuals with type 2 diabetes often need to take insulin injections. Other than a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, there are no known causes of type 2 diabetes. However, researchers suspect that genetic predisposition plays a role. In fact, one out of four Caucasians carry a mutation that disrupts the gene responsible for making insulin. Patients who carry a mutated version of the gene may suffer from type 2 diabetes. A recent study found that individuals with mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were significantly more susceptible to developing type 2 diabetes compared to those without a mutation. These mutations include BRCA1, BRCA2, CACNA1C, and HLA-B27. \nViewed: 0\r

For more information about how your genetics may contribute to your type 2 diabetes status please see our Genetics page.

High blood pressure (hy","Chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, arthritis, asthma, osteoarthritis, etc., can contribute to societal problems like pollution, obesity, crime, disability, and absenteeism. However, they are not necessarily bad or harmful; rather, there may be some positive benefits associated with certain conditions. The following are examples of good health outcomes related to chronic illnesses: \nA chronic condition is an illness that is considered by doctors to require treatment in order to prevent its recurrence. There are many different types of chronic diseases, and each one has its own classification system.\n

\begin{tabular}{ttop} \textrm {Cancer.1} A disease is classified as having cancer when it causes damage to the body or the surrounding tissue (e.g., cancerous growths). If any other cause is found, this type of cancer will not be treated. \end{tabular} \brief Symptoms of Cancer The symptoms of cancer include the following: \nCancer is usually an aggressive tumor growing outside of the body. Some cancers also spread from cells into other parts of the body, which are called metastases. It takes time for these cancers to grow back after their initial appearance, but if untreated, they can become a danger to life. \nIn addition to physical pain, cancer patients often feel tired, weak, and often fatigued. This is because chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, medications, etc., all affect a person's ability to function. People with cancer who cannot tolerate treatment may experience serious side effects. \nCancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. About 2 million people die annually due to cancer, and it accounts for 8% of all deaths among adults ages 20 years and older.\nHow You Can Help Patients and their families deal with the symptoms and loss of quality of life associated with cancer and other chronic diseases: \nBy seeking out information on your local newspapers, libraries, public libraries, and websites.

By providing personal referrals to appropriate physicians who have expertise in dealing with diseases that affect a large number of people at once.

By giving others a chance to learn more about their disease.

by contacting your elected officials who represent you in the state legislature and/or in Congress, and asking them to pass legislation that helps improve access to medical care.

By educating yourself about the facts about the effects of chronic diseases on society. Please share this guide","Chronic disease has many different forms and symptoms, and each causes varying levels of damage to our body and brain.\nIn this section, you will learn: \/\ 1) The basic definitions of these terms;

Does it really? Complete Answer: Smoking does cause cancers, but only when you smoke. Other causes of cancer include: \/\ 1) Exposure to chemicals and carcinogens in tobacco, particularly tar; \/\ 2) Excessive alcohol consumption; \/\ 3) Diet; \/\ 4) Radiation exposure; \/\ 5) Infection; \/\ 6) Environmental toxins such as pesticides and herbicides; \/\ 7) Overuse of painkillers or other addictive substances. \nQuestion: Why don't I get sick from eating meat? Complete Answer: This question is not specific to any one food. You may be exposed to certain environmental factors that might trigger an attack on the immune system. For example: \/\ 1) Being born into poor circumstances. (This could happen in pregnancy or after birth.) \/\ 2) Living near pollution or heavy metals; \/\ 3) Experiencing radiation exposure. \/\ 4) Having a weakened immune system from chemotherapy. \/\ 5) Having a weakened digestive tract due to diabetes or another ailment. \/\ 6) Consuming large amounts of high fat foods, such as red meats, cream cheese, butter, etc. \/\ 7) Drinking too much water to keep up your weight. \/\ 8) Taking antibiotics or antifungals regularly without a prescription. \/\ 9) Using hormone replacement therapy, which can weaken your immune system. \/\ 10) Eating lots of","In general, there are many reasons why people develop chronic illnesses: poor nutrition, infections, stress, tobacco use, environmental factors, and other lifestyle choices, such as smoking or drinking too much alcohol. Chronic disease is an important factor in determining your own lifespan, but it's not the only one; the severity of illness affects how much time you live and whether you can work.\r

For more information on what causes a person to develop a certain type of chronic illness (and how long someone has lived with that condition), see ""Types of Chronic Illnesses"" below.

A person with a type of chronic illness (or multiple types) may experience symptoms at different times throughout their lifetime. It would be wise to talk to your doctor if you're concerned that the onset of new types of chronic illnesses is occurring at any particular time in your life. The following list includes some common chronic conditions:

Diabetes - This common disease is caused by high blood glucose levels. There are several types of diabetes, including Type 1 and Type 2. When insulin isn't enough to control blood glucose levels, blood sugar spikes. Symptoms include sudden weight loss, difficulty exercising, unexplained fatigue, lack of appetite, blurred vision, and sometimes hallucinations, seizures, or coma. You'll likely notice these changes first in your twenties. Diabetes also occurs when your body produces too little insulin (insulin is produced naturally in cells) after meals because carbohydrates aren't absorbed properly into the bloodstream during digestion. Many people have no obvious signs or symptoms of this disorder until they start eating refined carbs and sugars like white bread, sweets, chips, potatoes, pasta, rice, and sweetened beverages like soda. If you're overweight, don't eat so much junk food, drink lots of water, avoid drinking alcohol or taking drugs, and exercise regularly, you probably won't have problems with diabetes. Learn more about diabetes here.

Heart Disease - Heart disease results from heart attacks or strokes. While heart attack victims typically suffer severe pain, shortness of breath, chest pains, and nausea, patients suffering from the disease often have trouble walking or even standing up without assistance. Heart disease may cause heart failure and death due to blockages in the arteries leading from the lungs to the heart muscle. Some forms of this disease are preventable - for example, if patients eat right and get regular physical activity. But if you've already had heart surgery, don't assume that heart disease will go away on its own. For more details on heart disease, check out Heart","The following are commonly referred as ""Chronic Diseases."" These include: heart disease, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, asthma, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, etc...\nQuestion: I have heard that you can cure cancer with a simple herbal medicine called ayurveda. Is this true?\nComplete Answer: This is probably one of the more popular myths out there and should be treated seriously. It is a lie. Ayurvedic medicine has been around for thousands of years and it's not an easy sell to some people. In fact, many patients who use it experience severe side effects such as stomach ulcers, headaches, nausea and vomiting. Some cases of kidney failure have also been reported; however, these problems occur in only 3% of patients using it. So if you think you may be interested in trying out ayurveda, go to your local Ayurvedic clinic to test them first! A few other things you might try: the herb ""Bhut Jolokia"" (also known as Bhutan Jasmine) contains natural anti-cancer properties and is an excellent tonic for various diseases; \nIn addition, I believe that in many instances, when someone wants to get rid of cancer they will find that they are able to do so simply by taking large quantities of BHT (butylated hydroxyanisole). Another good option would be to take vitamin C pills and/or eat foods rich in Vitamin C (such as oranges, carrots, apples, lemons and strawberries.)\nQuestion: What is a diet rich in antioxidants?\nAnswer: One way of getting antioxidants into your body is through consuming animal products. Animal fats contain the same types of antioxidant chemicals found naturally in plants, but in greater amounts. A healthy diet containing 1 cup of fat per day provides all the fatty acids one needs while providing all of the essential vitamins and minerals that your body requires to function properly and stay well. That being said, not everyone can afford to follow a strict vegan or vegetarian diet. For those who can afford to live a meatless lifestyle, there is no need to worry. Many plants provide numerous beneficial compounds which provide much needed nutrients as well as helping prevent cancer, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's, degenerative joint disease, depression, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, and even Alzheimer's itself. To learn more about what foods to consume to support a plant based diet, please visit http://www.dietfory","Chronic diseases can cause damage to our bodies that are not easily reversible. They may be lifelong or short term. These conditions include heart disease, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, Parkinson's disease, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, cataracts, depression, and many other conditions. The American Heart Association states that 10% of Americans will die from some form of heart attack in their lifetime, while 20% of Americans will die from some form of kidney failure in their lifetime. \nQuestion: How do I get help with an illness when I am alone without anyone else around me to talk with? Do you think that having a doctor who is sympathetic to my situation would make it easier? Complete Answer: It depends on what kind of physician you want to seek help with. If you want to see a specialist, your primary care physician could be the best place to start looking. He or she should be able to give you some recommendations and perhaps refer you to a specialized facility if needed.\nQuestion: Can you recommend any treatment options or drugs for treating my condition, such as pain management? Complete Answer: Pain relief is possible by medications or physical therapy. There are also a variety of alternatives to traditional medical practices, including acupuncture, herbal therapies, homeopathy, chiropractic techniques, and massage techniques. In addition, there are alternative health practitioners who work closely with the patients and offer the patient-oriented services of a holistic approach. \nQuestion: When I was at the hospital where I received emergency treatment, I noticed a nurse wearing a black dress. Was this uniform required during my medical stay? Is the black dress part of the standard uniform of a hospital worker? Complete Answer: No, nurses in hospitals wear uniforms only under special circumstances. Nurses are often seen on the hospital floor, assisting and supervising physicians in administering medication, performing surgeries, and caring for patients. Nurse uniforms vary depending on their location and the type of hospital they serve. \nQuestion: What are the differences between the types of treatments available in the United States and abroad for chronic illnesses? Complete Answer: Each country has its own methods of treating certain chronic ailments. Some countries use the principles of natural medicine to treat diseases; others focus more on science-based treatments. For example, in Japan, doctors apply heat and cold to treat diabetes; in France, the same procedure is used but doctors administer a different brand of insulin. And so on. In general, doctors believe that medicines and interventions provided in accordance with conventional medicine will be effective against a","Chronic disease (cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease) is an abnormal growth of cells in the body. Diseases affect all humans regardless of age or physical condition. The typical symptoms associated with these diseases include pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, skin changes, joint and muscle pains, weight gain/loss, difficulty sleeping, blurred vision, loss of hearing, and sometimes even death.\nTo help you better understand what each of these conditions mean, this article provides some basic information on each of them. \r

As mentioned above, cancer can lead to more serious problems such as breast, colon, prostate, lung, kidney, and bone marrow cancers. If not treated properly, cancer will eventually kill you. You should consult your doctor if you experience any of these kinds of symptoms. Other diseases that may be caused by certain chronic illnesses include diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, high cholesterol, low blood pressure, obesity, asthma, allergies, depression, migraine headaches, rheumatoid arthritis, and many others. \nQuestion: Which diseases are connected to other diseases such as diabetes and heart disease? Complete Answer: Many different types of chronic diseases are related to one another. Some of the following conditions often cause both a cancer and a heart attack: \nRheumatic heart disease (rhinitis), which is inflammation in the lining of the lungs; \nPulmonary embolism, which occurs when air rushes into the lungs due to an injury; \nCancer that spreads to other parts of the body (such as lung cancer); \nEpilepsy (convulsions), especially during pregnancy; \nDiabetes, which has various causes but typically results from overfeeding or lack of exercise; \nHeart attacks, especially at the start of life and again after age 65; \nDementia, usually of the elderly, which includes memory loss and mental deterioration; \nAcute myocardial infarction (heart attack), also called myocardial infarction, sudden death after a heart attack, or a heart attack, which does not involve a blockage of coronary arteries; \nLiver cirrhosis, which means liver damage and can occur through several reasons, including alcohol abuse or hepatitis C infection. Liver disease is a leading cause of mortality among people aged 65 and older. It can progress rapidly if untreated. For example, people who drink too much alcohol increase their risk of dying within five years of consuming 1 drink per day or 10 drinks per week for women","In general, there is no one disease that causes all of them. There are more than 1,000 different types of chronic diseases in which one or another type of damage can result from each type of disease. Some of these diseases may be caused by various environmental factors (e.g., infections) and/or lifestyle behaviors (such as smoking). Other conditions such as cancer, diabetes mellitus, arthritis, heart disease, stroke, and other neurological disorders are also part of this large category. The list below summarizes the main categories of chronic diseases and gives examples of symptoms that might occur with each disease. \nCommon Chronic Diseases\nDiabetes Type I Diabetes (type I) Type II Diabetes (type II) Cerebrovascular Disease Arthritis

Complete Answer: By providing them with accurate information on their symptoms, medications, treatments, and the options available to prevent, manage, or cure these diseases. You will also help people choose and follow up with physicians and other professionals in their respective communities that can provide relevant patient care. Question: Do you support or oppose state and federal legislation against the practice of medicine? Are there any specific laws that you would like to see modified in order to allow for your own work as an advocate and educator?\nComplete Answer: I am personally in favor of both legislative changes and educational efforts aimed at reducing stigma and discrimination. However, it is my belief that we should be able to communicate clearly to our patients what the alternatives to medication are so they can make informed choices. Questions answered by Dr. Peter D'Alessandro Question #1: You recently wrote in Your Work That Fights Cancer: ""I believe that medical school has become one giant advertisement for conventional drugs."" In addition, you've written that doctors need to stay away from using new, non-traditional medicines.

Answer: The University of Michigan Medical School. My colleagues and I at UMS serve all individuals, regardless of age, ability, or financial means. It would not be possible to carry out these programs if we had to rely solely on our own resources or funding sources. Our goal is to improve the quality of life of all individuals in our community. We cannot afford to lose an opportunity for such a valuable education.

It can automatically detect when you fall asleep based on factors such as how much time has passed since you last slept, how long it took you to get to bed, and whether or not you have fallen asleep during the day. The Sleep Monitor app also tells you if your body clock is off by an hour each night.

2nd, it's very important that you eat enough food throughout the day—especially during the first few hours of the day.

These drugs also increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. In addition, some studies have shown that many other medications can cause weight loss by decreasing appetite. For example, certain antihistamines (including Benadryl, Prozac, and others) reduce hunger. Thus, it is important that an individual evaluate the potential adverse effect(s) of prescribed medications.

In case of concern, consult with your doctor before initiating a new lifestyle program. If you experience significant changes in your weight, please talk to your physician. As well, it is recommended that you see a health care professional immediately if you notice any of these symptoms;

Provide useful, complete, and scientifically-grounded answers to common consumer search queries about health.\nQuestion: my risk for developing type 2 diabetes\nComplete Answer:","yes. \nQuestion: what is the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes? Complete Answer: the two conditions have some of the same symptoms but different causes. There may be some overlap in diagnostic tests performed at the same time. Type 1 Diabetes (T1DM) occurs when your body does not produce enough insulin for the amount of sugar that your cells need. The condition is caused by a defect in how your blood-forming cells handle sugar; it is characterized by excessive production of glucose from the bloodstream rather than the pancreas. You will most likely develop T1DM if you have had problems with weight gain, lack of exercise or insufficient sleep. Your doctor may suggest that you follow a low-carbohydrate diet and/or exercise more during this phase of your disease. Symptoms include loss of appetite, decreased energy levels, fatigue, and sometimes weakness. Most people who get T1DM develop insulin resistance, which increases their sensitivity to insulin. After 5 years on treatment, you should be able to continue normal daily activities without requiring any additional help. However, because there are still risks involved in taking medication for long periods of time, many patients choose to discontinue treatment early and begin eating healthier again. If you wish to change your health status, consult your physician before changing lifestyle habits. Types of Diabetes In addition to the two types of diabetes, there are also three other types of diabetes - juvenile-onset type 1 (juvenile-onset diabetes), adult-onset type 1 (adult-onset diabetes), and advanced-stage type 1 (advanced-stage diabetes). Juvenile-onset Type I (JOTI) Adult-onset Type II (ASMI) JotI Adult-onset Type III (ASV) ASMI Advanced-stage Type I (ASVI) ASVI

Type 1 Diabetes (T1DM) is an inherited disease that affects mainly the young, male population of industrialized countries. It can occur in people of all ages, but most commonly develops during childhood or adolescence. In adults with T1DM, the pancreas produces too little insulin, causing the blood sugar level to rise rapidly as well as putting extra pressure on the heart muscle. As a result, the person becomes severely impaired in several areas of their lives, including mental function, physical function, appetite control, and quality of life. In children with T1DM, the condition usually begins in adolescence or adulthood. Although the diagnosis of T1DM is based on blood sugar levels, a","If you have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, your blood glucose will be higher than normal because of the condition. Your doctor or dietitian can help you adjust your diet to reduce your risk for developing the disease.\nQuestion: I am concerned about my weight and want to lose some pounds. How do I get started? Complete Answer: Find out what healthy eating patterns look like by following this link: http://www.healthline.com/HealthlineMain_Page (this link may take you to different sites). You can also visit a dietitian or physician at your local community health center or local pharmacy. There you'll find information on specific foods you should avoid. You can also learn more about how obesity affects people who have type 2 diabetes.\nQuestion: My family has had multiple miscarriages in the last three years. What should I do? Complete Answer: The odds that an individual is pregnant when they become sick is 1 in 100,000. It's best not to consider having a miscarriage unless there was something very serious happening to make it medically advisable. For example, if your baby died shortly after birth or you were experiencing severe vomiting or diarrhea. These circumstances could potentially cause the pregnancy to end early. In these cases, talk with your doctor about whether it's safe to continue the pregnancy. Remember, every woman is unique so it's important for each of them to have their own personal choices about how to treat themselves if they decide to become pregnant again after having recently miscarried. Questions for Support Question: What happens if I don't follow the guidelines for eating right? Complete Answer: The next time you eat food from your grocery store, restaurant, or other place where food is sold, ask yourself if this food would be allowed under federal health law or state law. Some states require businesses to provide calorie counts of any foods sold in stores; others allow restaurants, cafeterias, or other places selling food to sell the menu items even though they're labeled ""fat free."" Many states also require manufacturers of packaged meals such as sandwiches to indicate if the ingredients come from animals. Food labeled as ""100 percent whole grain"" doesn't mean all of its carbohydrates come from whole grains but instead comes from corn or wheat. And many states require manufacturers of prepared foods such as soups and salads to list the amount of sodium, total fat, saturated fat, sugar, potassium, magnesium, fiber, calcium, vitamins A and E, vitamin C, beta carotene, and iron. Most Americans believe that they","the number of people with type 2 diabetes in your state is small enough that you do not need to worry about it at all. Question: my diet is healthy\nComplete Answer: your diet is probably fine, but there's no point having a very high calorie diet. You may have some problems if you eat a lot more than the recommended amount of calories. If you think you should change or reduce your dietary habits, contact your doctor.","Your blood sugar levels can vary greatly depending on your age, sex, exercise level, race/ethnicity, stress levels, medications you take, the type of food you eat, and many other factors. Many people with Type 2 Diabetes who have never had Type 1 Diabetes also develop it. Some people are able to prevent type 2 diabetes by eating healthy foods at an early age, taking medications as directed, or both. Learn more about the disease, how to prevent it, and ways to manage your condition.

Your risk for developing type 2 diabetes depends largely on your height and weight. Your body mass index (BMI) is usually calculated from your weight, height, age, gender, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity level, and use of medication. You should be aware that BMI increases when you get older and that your height may be less important than once thought because your height increases in relation to your weight. BMI categories: <18.5 18.5 – 24.9 25.0 – 29.9 30.0 – 34.9 35.0 – 39.9 40.0+ There are a lot of different types of diabetes which affect different groups of people differently. Your chances of developing diabetes depend greatly on your sex, age, diet, lifestyle, and genetics. For example, males are twice as likely to develop Type 2 Diabetes than females. And if you have two parents who each have Type 1, you're much more likely to develop Type 2 than if one parent has Type 2. Other differences include: The number of genes for Type 1 vs. Type 2 Diabetes. Men inherit up to 3x as many Type 1 genes from their mothers as they do from fathers. This means that only 50% of men will be diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes. Women inherit 4 times as many Type 1 genes from their mothers as they do from fathers. This means that 80% of women will be diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes. The amount of time that people spend sleeping. Insufficient sleep has been linked to increased rates of Type 2 Diabetes and premature death. A person's ability to control his or her sleep habits (i.e., whether or not he or she sleeps at night or stays up late). People with Type 2 Diabetes often need additional support to make sure they keep a regular sleep schedule. If you sleep too little, you'll be more likely to have irregular or poor sleep patterns, and this could lead to more serious problems later in life. This makes your chances of developing type 2 diabetes even higher.","A person who has had Type 1 diabetes is at increased risk of developing diabetes or its complications. There are many factors that can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (e.g., being overweight or obese). As your body fat percentage increases, so does the likelihood that you will have diabetes. Although it may seem counterintuitive at first, people with a low BMI (body mass index) often benefit from having an exercise program in place; they tend to be healthier and live longer than those with a higher weight. While there may not be a simple cause-and-effect relationship between body fat percentage and insulin resistance, it should be considered when making lifestyle changes to improve cardiovascular disease risk management (see the link below for more information on healthy eating and physical activity recommendations).

Question: Is it possible to lose weight without doing any exercise? Complete Answer: Yes. Weight loss is achievable through both aerobic and anaerobic training in combination with calorie restriction. The evidence supporting these approaches to achieving and maintaining weight loss is consistent across studies conducted over time.\nQuestion: I am concerned about whether weight loss will lead to increased risk of cancer. Complete Answer: Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and among U.S. adults aged 20 years and older. It's important to understand how obesity impacts the overall population. Obesity is associated with several chronic diseases. One such condition is type 2 diabetes mellitus, which leads to high blood sugar levels. People with diabetes are likely to experience significant reductions in their ability to burn calories because of the impaired glucose tolerance caused by the accumulation of fat cells (diabesity). In addition, increasing body weight results in greater likelihood of developing metabolic syndrome, which includes hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and other conditions that raise the chance of heart disease.


The American Diabetes Association estimates that 40% of Americans and 30% of African-Americans have prediabetic diabetes and 30% of Latinos and 10% of whites have prehypertension. \nQuestion: What do you think about the proposed new federal rules regarding alcohol advertising? Complete Answer: Alcohol sales ads on TV and radio would remain banned under the existing Federal Communications Commission rules governing airtime, but could face stricter scrutiny under a new rule created by Congress as part of the House Republican legislation recently passed into law.


According to the New","Your body produces insulin naturally. There is no safe level of glucose in your blood. You need to make sure you have the correct amount of carbohydrates as well as healthy fats so that your cells can use this glucose properly. When you eat too much carbohydrates, it will raise your blood sugar and cause you to feel hungry. Some people may also become dehydrated because they consume too many carbohydrates in their diets. If you experience any of these symptoms, stop eating carbs immediately and consult with your doctor. A small amount of carbohydrates from fruits and vegetables may help. These include blueberries (3g), apples (1/4 cup), pears (1/2 cup) and peaches (1/8 cup). For more information on how to get enough protein, see our Healthy Weight Recipes.

Answer: \N\The answer depends upon your age, sex, weight, activity level, current smoking habits, and other factors.

Your risk for type 2 diabetes increases if you smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol regularly. Also, if you are overweight, have high cholesterol levels, or suffer from diabetes complications such as heart disease or kidney failure. You should check your diabetes medication closely. If needed, your doctor may prescribe an additional diabetes drug to prevent the development of diabetes complications. This could be called metformin. You may not develop diabetes if you do not take metformin (see below). However, your doctor may recommend that you take metformin if you have had pancreatitis or other pancreatic disease and you are at higher risk for diabetes complications. Ask your doctor if this is recommended. Keep in mind that some patients who start taking metformin develop hypoglycemia before it has been shown to work and that treatment with metformin may result in side effects and withdrawal reactions. See the FDA Web site for full details.

Some doctors warn against all diabetics using metformin unless prescribed by a physician. If you decide to try metformin without consulting your doctor, you should continue to follow your doctor's instructions carefully. It takes several weeks for metformin to work and for its effect to wear off. The longer you use metformin, the greater the chance you will relapse and regain your pre-metformin weight. So make sure you know what dose of metformin is right for you, including how long you want to stay on it. As discussed above, you need to avoid high fat foods to reduce your risk for type 2 diabetes. Many diabetic medications also contain substances","Your risk for developing Type 2 Diabetes is 50% or more if you smoke, drink alcohol, eat too many fat foods, have high blood pressure, or are overweight. You are at lower risk if you follow dietary guidelines that reduce your consumption of saturated fats and cholesterol and decrease the amount of red meat in your diet. In addition, you may be at higher risk for Type 2 Diabetes if you are over age 35 years old (2).

How can I minimize my risk for type 2 diabetes? Complete Answer: To avoid having a negative impact on your future health, it is important to maintain a healthy weight and to exercise regularly. You should also talk with your doctor about any medication you take that could affect your body's ability to use insulin properly.

What is the purpose of my personal consultation regarding diabetes? Complete Answer: We are looking forward to discussing with you how we can best assist you with the development of an effective diabetic management plan. Our goal is to help you develop a personalized plan of care that will ensure that you remain well and free from complications as long as possible.

Health Care Information: Diabetes

Diabetes Basics","\N \The risk of type 2 diabetes is very low when it comes to diet and lifestyle factors. There is no evidence that having a higher body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference increases your chances of getting the disease. The odds of having Type 2 Diabetes in women is 1 in 4, while men have an approximately one in ten chance. It takes between 5 and 10 years to develop type 2 diabetes.

\N Question: how much sugar should I consume daily\nAnswer: A serving size of 1 cup has approximately 3 grams of carbohydrates.

\N Question: can I eat more fat than carbs? Answer: Yes! You can enjoy many healthy fatty foods like cheese, butter, eggs, nuts and seeds without consuming too much sugar. For example, you could have 1/2 cup of cheese with a few slices of bread as part of your meal. If you do not eat enough carbs, there may be consequences such as weight gain, which could affect your overall health.

If you want to learn more on this topic please visit our page on Nutrition.","Your risk of type 2 diabetes increases with age, and you should always be aware of your diabetes risk factors before deciding whether or not to engage in any exercise program. If you do decide to exercise or engage in other physical activity that may increase your risk of type 2 diabetes, it is important that you discuss these risks with your healthcare provider so he can advise how best to treat your condition. For more information on the specific steps needed to manage your diabetes, please visit www.diabetes.gov/healthy-living/. \nQuestion: I am overweight and want to lose weight! Complete Answer: It is recommended that you limit your calorie intake if you have insulin resistance, because this will reduce your risk of obesity. Weight loss is usually gradual. It may take up to 4 months for your body to change its preferences, but you need to continue to keep track of the amount of calories you consume every day to achieve your goal. You also need to consider any changes that affect your energy expenditure (i.e., exercising less). \nQuestion: How much does exercise improve my health? Complete Answer: Exercise has been shown to help improve many aspects of people's physical health, including heart rate variability. In addition, exercise improves cognitive function, which helps improve attention, memory, and thinking skills. Some studies indicate that low-intensity exercise (such as brisk walking) may even help prevent cancer. People who exercise regularly should also try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity each week. \nQuestion: Should I try to control my diet? Complete Answer: Although it is unlikely that a controlled diet would improve most people's overall health, you should definitely talk with your healthcare provider about changing your eating habits if necessary. As long as your daily caloric intake remains within limits set by your healthcare provider and does not exceed the recommended range, you will likely still benefit from lifestyle changes like reducing saturated fat consumption and increasing fruits and vegetables and healthy fats like olive oil. Also, it is possible to increase the amount of protein in your diet, which may decrease your chances of having high blood pressure, which is associated with an increased risk of stroke, heart disease, and diabetes. The American Heart Association recommends eating 6 to 8 servings of lean meat per day and limiting red meat to no more than two ounces per day, while the Institute of Medicine suggests six to eight servings of whole grains, seven to nine ounces of fruit and vegetables, and three to five servings of beans.","I am an active user of insulin. My body is able to keep up with the increased glucose levels resulting from taking insulin. This may result in less weight gain than if you had no insulin. In fact, when your blood sugar levels increase more slowly than they would normally, you might actually lose some weight. \nQuestion: my risk for developing cancer\nAnswer: There is a small chance that one person who has smoked will develop lung cancer. If this happens it is very unlikely that it will be caused by smoking. The reason why the chances of cancer are so low is because our bodies do not have any way of knowing whether we have been exposed to certain chemicals or substances as we age. However, there are many other things that can cause cancer. For example, drinking too much alcohol, which is known to increase the risk of bladder cancer, smoking, being overweight, having high cholesterol, obesity, certain medicines, radiation exposure and infections.\nQuestion: how long does it take me to eat a meal?\nAnswer: It takes a little while until you can eat anything. When you first get food into your mouth the taste is usually unpleasant, but after two minutes or so everything tastes good and you want to eat all at once. You then need time to digest the food before you can feel full. After four hours you start to feel hungry again. At night when the hunger pangs go away you will start eating again. You may eat for three days straight without feeling like eating. Some people think that you should not eat on Sunday, since the fasting period helps them to break their fast. But I recommend that you abstain from going out on the town during the day on Sundays. As soon as the week begins you will feel thirsty again. On Mondays you still need to drink water, but most people find it easier to drink soda instead of water. By keeping up with your diet you will see that after ten days you will have lost half of what you started with.

Provide useful, complete, and scientifically-grounded answers to common consumer search queries about health.\nQuestion: Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?\nComplete Answer:","The answer is no. People with type 1 diabetes (diabetes mellitus) have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease because their blood sugar levels go up when they eat.\r

\r

The Ketogenic Diet is not suitable for all people. It can be extremely difficult to control the amount of carbohydrates you consume on this diet. If you do decide to start a ketogenic diet, it is strongly advised that you consult your doctor before beginning a new diet. In addition, you should keep in mind that many supplements will alter the composition of your diet, so be sure to discuss them with your healthcare professional first! \r


What is Ketosis?\r

Ketosis is the state where body fat stores are reduced to very low levels. Fat cells produce less energy per unit of fuel as opposed to glucose cells which make more energy from glucose. This creates a situation where there is less available oxygen and less available energy. That's why most people experience ketones. However, some people do NOT experience any ketosis and they don't even know it exists. So what causes ketosis?\r

\r

When we eat food that contains carbs, our bodies use the stored carbohydrate as fuel for energy production. When we eat foods that contain fats, our body uses the fats as energy source. When we eat foods that contain proteins, our body uses protein as its main fuel. Therefore, when we eat carbohydrates or fat, we can change the way our bodies burn energy.\r


How do I get my calories back if I am eating carbs and/or fat?\r

As soon as we stop consuming carbs or fats, we start using less energy to carry out these activities. The end result is an increase in hunger which can cause us to eat more than necessary. At times, the desire to eat can also trigger overeating behavior that leads to weight gain.\r


Do I need to reduce or eliminate sugars?\r

Yes. Sugar has been linked to obesity, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and osteoporosis. Even moderate amounts of added sugars can negatively affect moods, sleep patterns, appetite, and overall quality of life. Studies show that adding simple sugars such as honey, agave syrup, cane juice and sucrose to a typical American diet increases the chances of developing Type 2 Diabetes, especially among children. However, increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, fish, lean meats,","In general, yes. However, there is no one answer for every patient.

People who take insulin or oral medications that lower blood sugar (glucose) can have success in following an ""Keto"" style diet without having to switch to glucose lowering medication such as metformin or sulfonylureas. This is because any type of food has carbohydrates which will be converted into glucose when consumed by your body, even if it does not contain glucose itself. If you have problems taking these medications and can't stick with an ""Keto"" diet, check out our comprehensive guide on how to use insulin correctly (including a section on what to do when you don't get enough). However, anyone planning to transition from using their usual medications should contact their doctor first! Question: How much protein should I eat to prevent osteoporosis and other bone loss after losing weight? Complete Answer: It depends on the individual's age, activity level, physical condition and genetics. We recommend you consume 1 gram of protein per kilogram of bodyweight daily as part of a balanced diet. However, there are no hard and fast rules regarding protein intake; it varies from person to person. You may need to consider what amounts will help keep you hydrated during exercise, and what will make your bones feel good and provide adequate strength. For more information about the role of calcium in keeping bones strong, please consult your physician.

For more information about the role of calcium in keeping bones strong, please consult your physician. Question: What is fat storage? Complete Answer: Fat stores were once thought to be confined to the liver - they're now known to be distributed throughout the entire body. Although it was believed that fat would only be stored around organs where we needed it most, recent studies have shown that fat can also be stored in multiple locations inside the body including muscle, cartilage, skin and other tissues. In addition to being stored under the skin, fat can also be found deep within the tissue. This means that fat storage can occur anywhere in the body, including on your belly button. The best way to protect yourself against fat storage in the stomach (the area closest to your waistline), is to avoid eating foods high in fat and calories. Many types of vegetables, fruit and low-fat dairy products should also be avoided. To learn more about how to determine whether certain types of fats are harmful, consult your doctor.

The diet is safe and effective for people with type 2 diabetes and those who have recently lost weight or gained it back. It can also be used by people with pre-diabetes, Type 1 Diabetes, and some types of cancer, as well as in people with epilepsy.\nQuestion: How does the ketone ester metabolism differ from other forms of fat loss?

Answer: Ketones are very similar in nature to fats. Both are derived from amino acids in the body. However, when you use ketone bodies like acetoacetate, you get an effect similar to that which occurs during exercise in muscles - you burn calories just as you would if you were running (or riding) on a bike. A similar result is obtained using beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). BHB helps you lose fat stores faster than any other way. In fact, if you give your liver enough BHB, it will convert them into ketones within minutes.\nWhen it comes to carbohydrates, ketosis has several advantages over sugar-based diets: You don't need to eat so much and stay in shape. All the carbs you consume are converted into ketones in the body. This means no more cravings for sweets!

A higher level of energy is required for each gram of carbohydrate consumed. This means your calorie deficit stays low, while your weight remains stable.


The ketogenic diet works great even if you've been eating regular ""empty"" foods all day long! Because it makes you feel fuller longer, you tend to stick with this type of diet throughout the week. So you'll never run out of food again, and your body won't crave junk food at night (which causes your waistline to become enlarged), making it easy to maintain healthy weight.

Another benefit of ketosis is that it actually improves your ability to regulate blood glucose levels, which affects both appetite and weight gain.

In addition, your ketones may help you lose unwanted fatty deposits that build up between cells in your skin. These deposits cause acne. If these fat deposits remain, they can lead to cancerous growths that damage cells and increase risk of heart disease.\nThis is why you should always wear a bandage over your swollen lip or mouth. If you do have acne, you should avoid alcohol and spicy foods.

To learn how to best utilize ketones, see the Ketotic Diet section below.

Questions? Comments? Concerns? Let us know","If you have type 1 Diabetes or if you are prediabetic (see http://diabetesjournals.org/content/43/3/972). For most people, it is not effective in managing or controlling the condition. The reason is that carbohydrates can increase blood sugar levels above normal, causing an acute rise of insulin. This raises blood sugar levels more rapidly than they would be without this effect. It is therefore important for you to remain as glucose tolerant as possible until your body has developed a tolerance to the effects of carbs on blood sugar. In addition, since many drugs do affect glucose levels, any drug may interact with carb restriction in some way. Therefore, your doctor will advise whether a diet high in fat and low in protein will be best suited to your situation. However, even if no medication seems appropriate or safe for your particular circumstances, the following advice applies: \nIf you are diabetic and your blood sugar goes up by 3% after eating 5g of carbs and then by 2% within 45 minutes, you should try and reduce the amount of food eaten.\n

Your physician can tell you what foods contain the most carbs, how much each of them should count towards your daily intake, and which ones have been shown to raise blood sugar when added to the diet. Keep track of these meals throughout the day. This will help ensure that you get enough nutrients while at the same time reducing carbs to where they won't cause your blood sugar level to go higher than necessary.\n\nQuestion: What kind of fats do I need to keep my body happy?\n\nAnswer: You need polyunsaturated oils, such as palm oil, coconut oil, olive oil, canola oil and soybean and corn oils. They provide essential fatty acids that keep your cells running smoothly and your heart healthy. \nQuestion: How long does it take me to gain back lost weight from a ketogenic diet?\n\nAnswer: Over time, there are many factors that influence a person's ability to maintain a healthy weight. Some examples include age, sex, height, genetics, physical activity and nutritional status. To make matters worse, the number of calories burned during exercise also influences your waistline. As your waistlines get wider over time, you need more energy to support the growth of muscle mass. When a diet becomes too restrictive, this puts extra strain on your metabolism, leading to increased calorie requirements, decreased overall fitness, and lower performance.\nQuestion: How effective is a","Yes. Keto diets have been shown to reduce blood glucose levels in diabetics, especially those who were on insulin for long periods of time (more than 12 months) prior to starting the diet. \nQuestion: What is the best way to eat high fat foods if I am diabetic and cannot control my own body weight?\nAnswer: High fat foods provide many important nutrients that improve blood sugar control, including protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals, and omega 3 fatty acids. However, they may also raise blood pressure, which can be dangerous when combined with a low carbohydrate or high calorie diet. If you want to lose fat, it's important not to limit your calories as much as possible. Try to keep your total caloric intake within your weight loss goals and try to maintain regular exercise and good nutrition to get the most out of your ketosis experience.

If your goal is simply losing fat, it is more important to consume large amounts of carbohydrates (e.g., whole grain breads, pastas, rice), fruits, vegetables and some fats (such as olive oil and coconut oil).

In general, we recommend eating at least 1 gram per kilogram of lean mass daily. For example, if you weigh 180 pounds and have 25% body fat, you should aim to consume about 30 grams of carbohydrates each day. When selecting foods to make into meal replacement shakes, choose products that contain at least 20 g of carbs per serving (approximately half of one fruit, avocado, or vegetable cup). Always check the labels before buying and consuming a meal substitute shake. These items often list small ""units"" of carbohydrates such as grams of sugars per ounce. If these units do not match up exactly with your desired amount of servings (e.g., 200 milligrams of sugar per serving) then you will need to adjust the amount of food needed. This information is available from some health food stores and online. You can find this information by searching for the term ""calories per unit.""

Protein Requirements - Weight Loss / Ketosis Tips

The following tips are intended to help you gain control over your ketone body and use your excess energy (i.e., the ketones produced during a fasting state of metabolic ketosis) to achieve a healthy weight. The","A ketogenic diet is not suitable for people with type 1 diabetes (the most common form of the disease). While it has been used successfully in some individuals with type 1 diabetes, other factors such as the body's natural response to insulin resistance and an individual's genetic makeup make this approach extremely difficult to apply across all types of patients. The best alternative for these individuals would be to avoid eating carbohydrates altogether, relying on foods that contain high amounts of protein or fat but do not have as much glycemic index (GI) values (meaning there is no spike in blood sugar levels when eaten). For more information see our Ketogenic Diet FAQs. \nQuestions: Is a low carb diet suitable for me? Complete Answer: Low carbohydrate diets are generally not suitable for people with type 2 diabetes who are taking medication that affects their pancreas. Although some studies have shown that the effects of low carbohydrate diets can be temporary, the majority of evidence indicates that they will lead to weight loss, even if these diets continue to cause gastrointestinal issues, liver damage, poor hormone function, and potentially worse health outcomes down the line. In addition, unlike some low carb diets which use lots of carbs (over 100 grams per day), a low carb diet that uses very few carbohydrates may actually result in a higher intake of calories than your body needs for healthy functioning. Therefore, while most doctors recommend that you limit your overall calorie intake to 1000 calories per day for everyone over the age of 40, this does not mean you need to go below 500 calories per day for those over 40 years old. In fact, many older adults should consume between 750 – 900 calories per day, depending on how active they are. However, it's always important to keep in mind the following important points before making any dietary changes: A low carb diet is different from low fat diets, so it's crucial to check out what your doctor recommends before you try anything new.

It takes time for a person's metabolism to adjust to reduced food intake and increased activity.

A person should eat large meals regularly to maintain good energy balance.

In general, a diet low in carbohydrates, especially white potatoes, should only be considered by diabetic patients who are trying to lose weight. If you're underweight or obese, see our article on Weight Loss and Diabetes for additional advice!","A person who is taking insulin has not been shown to have an adverse effect on their glucose control when they follow a ketogenic or keto diet. In addition, there is little evidence that the type of food consumed affects blood sugar levels in patients taking insulin (i.e., individuals who do not eat carbohydrates). When you take insulin, your body produces the hormone insulin. Insulin increases glucose uptake by cells through several pathways. The increase in glucose uptake can reduce blood glucose levels because it lowers blood sugar levels and leads to increased use of insulin (which can decrease the amount of insulin available to the cell) and more efficient utilization of glucose. Because your body does not produce insulin to make glucose, you will need to consume less carbohydrate than would normally be required to maintain normal blood sugars. Your pancreas may release insulin if necessary, but it is unlikely that this will cause you to experience any side effects. If you find yourself having trouble keeping a regular meal schedule, try avoiding carbs entirely during these times. For example, if you feel like eating breakfast every day at 8am, avoid carbohydrates. You should also ensure that you don't lose too much weight while following a ketogenic diet because losing fat can result in weight gain. For information on how to create a personalized nutrition plan, please see our Nutritional Consultation section.

The Bottom Line This section provides a brief overview of research findings related to diabetes and ketosis. It highlights some of the most frequently asked questions about using a ketogenic diet and how many calories you should be consuming per day as well as your daily carb intake.

Is a Ketogenic Diet Helpful for People With Diabetes?

A number of studies indicate that people with type 1 diabetes and/or type 2 diabetes may benefit from adopting a low carbohydrate lifestyle such as a very low carbohydrate diet or a ketogenic diet (see Table 1 below). However, some patients may find the benefits of using such diets difficult or impossible to sustain over time (for more information, please see: ""Ketogenic Diets - What's the Difference Between a Low Carbohydrate & Ketogenic Diet?""). Many of the clinical trials that evaluated the efficacy of a low carbohydrate diet for managing type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes have involved patients with mild to moderate complications. Because people with chronic illnesses often seek alternative treatment options, careful consideration must always be given before making dietary recommendations. While the best way to ensure adequate blood sugar control and prevent complications associated with diabetes is to manage blood glucose levels with medication and monitor them closely,","Yes! Ketosis is the ideal condition for all patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, as it induces insulin resistance in a manner that is similar to those of normal healthy individuals. As well, this state causes weight loss when compared to anabolic steroids or low carb diets that have been shown to be effective for diabetics. It also leads to a significant increase in ketone bodies as measured by urine ketones. In addition, ketones increase blood glucose levels which is essential for normal glucose metabolism in our body. When you consume ketone bodies from your food (in either form), they can be used as an alternate fuel source for prolonged periods of time, such as after exercise, while reducing the need to drink large amounts of fluids. This increases performance during any physical activity, especially when combined with training. The ketosis induced by consuming foods containing ketone bodies is most desirable as it can enhance mood, stimulate energy production, reduce inflammation, improve mental functions, and decrease insulin sensitivity. A diet high in protein will not allow for the accumulation of ketones and therefore may result in greater appetite suppression. If you are trying to lose weight, use a diet that has lower fat content than what your current intake. Some research indicates that adding 50 grams of carbohydrate per day is sufficient to help prevent weight regain. For someone who is attempting to gain weight, eating more carbohydrates (especially refined carbs) may actually contribute to weight gain.

How do I know if I am getting enough calories in my diet? Complete Answer: Your body uses approximately 3,000 calories daily. You should aim for at least 1,500 calories a day per pound of lean mass (such as muscle, bone, water, etc.). If you are gaining weight, you will likely need to eat less than this. While there are many factors that go into determining your calorie needs, including your age and sex, the biggest factor contributing to weight gain is simply being overweight. It's critical that we recognize this because weight loss programs designed specifically for women tend to leave them feeling like their ""weight is their problem,"" rather than a primary cause. Therefore, a weight-loss program tailored to men, and men only, requires much better scientific evidence. Another important component of losing weight is maintaining your daily caloric requirements. When you exercise regularly, you are able to burn more calories than if you were sedentary. Additionally, when you avoid fatty foods such as fried foods and fast foods, you must replace these calories by burning up more fiber and other nutrients. Research suggests that eating breakfast improves","In general, ketosis is desirable in those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes because it can help lower blood sugar levels and may reduce the risk of serious complications such as kidney damage, heart attack, stroke, blindness, and death due to complications from insulin resistance. However, some patients with severe forms of diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) who have had unsuccessful treatments for several years will be more likely to benefit from a ketogenic diet. \nQuestion: Should I take medication to control my condition?\nComplete Answer: The treatment options for the person taking insulin depend on the individual's symptoms and personal preference, but any medication that lowers blood glucose concentrations should generally not interfere with the body's ability to use carbohydrates. There are many medications available for individuals whose symptoms include extreme thirst, hunger, diarrhea, vomiting, sweating, dizziness, muscle weakness, irritability, lack of concentration, trouble sleeping, nausea, and/or constipation. Some medications are also prescribed for individuals with certain psychiatric conditions, such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Other medications include antihistamines and antiepileptic drugs for epilepsy, anticonvulsants for seizures and glaucoma, antiplatelets and thrombolytics for heart attacks, and antihypertensives for hypertension. Most people taking anabolic steroids, particularly those using diuretic supplements, will require additional monitoring when switching from oral contraceptives to other types of hormone replacement therapy. For these reasons, there must always be consideration given to the potential side effects of all different kinds of medications. This includes the potential risks of these medications and how they might interact with each other, including interactions between different medicines for a particular disease. If you do decide to start taking anabolic steroid medications at this time, make sure to discuss with your healthcare provider how frequently you should change dosage. For example, if you're taking an SSRI at night while you sleep, you may want to switch to another one before bedtime, to ensure the best possible results. When looking at the potential benefits and risks of taking anabolic steroid medications, remember that only a few factors can determine whether something works for you or not; therefore, there is no single answer. You should consider a variety of factors, including both physical and psychological aspects. For example, if your primary goal is weight loss, then testosterone replacement therapy may improve your mood and help you manage weight better by improving self esteem. On the other hand, if"

Provide useful, complete, and scientifically-grounded answers to common consumer search queries about health.\nQuestion: Can diabetes be cured?\nComplete Answer:","Yes. \nHealthy Diabetes is the name of an established treatment which consists in eliminating insulin resistance (the result of over-feeding of carbohydrate and protein) from blood sugar levels.\nAs glucose levels rise due to poor eating habits, there is an increased production of insulin, increasing the amount of available calories for metabolism, thus reducing insulin sensitivity. In the case of Type 2 diabetes, this results in the loss of control of blood sugars which can lead to serious complications such as blindness or amputation (although that condition is rare).\nIf you feel like your current response does not meet the criteria above, please contact us at 1-800-CANCER (1-800-784-2433),\nand we will do our best to assist.

This answer provides the most comprehensive overview available on this topic. A more extensive summary of the many factors affecting the course of diabetes can be found at http://www.diabetes.org/get_informed/resources/dietary_management.html

The following two questions provide additional information on the subject.

1) What should I do if I have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes? \nAnswer: The diagnosis of type 2 diabetes means you're prediabetic and are likely to develop complications in your life. To minimize any problems associated with diabetes, it's best to avoid high blood pressure and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. If you are prediabetic, your doctor may suggest lifestyle adjustments such as reducing sodium intake or eating less starch (sugar), increasing fiber, and consuming a lower calorie diet. In addition, some medications are known to increase insulin levels, which makes you more prone to developing hypoglycemia. You can get a list of diabetic drugs at http://www.diabetes.org/get_informed/medications/.

2) How long does type 2 diabetes last? Does it affect my ability to work? \nAnswer: Type 2 diabetes usually begins in early adulthood but usually occurs later on in life. Although it's not possible to predict when an individual will develop diabetes from their height or weight alone, many studies indicate there's no relationship between these variables and type 2 diabetes. Your body's metabolism tends to slow down during childhood and adolescence, making your chances of developing diabetes seem greater than they really are. For example, a person who weighs 135 pounds at age 10 years has a 5 percent chance of having type 2 diabetes by age 20 years; a 165-pound person at age 15 has only a 4 percent chance. However, if both parents are diabetics, this number rises to nearly 50 percent. For those who were born before 1978, however, the rate rises to 73 percent. Thus, diabetes is often seen at a very young age, after children start growing into healthy adults, suggesting that most individuals develop it earlier than expected. While it's important to stay active and eat properly until you've developed your own normal range of activity and weight, the sooner you can take steps to reduce diabetes risks, the better. Diabetics who exercise regularly lose weight because exercising raises glucose production in muscle tissue.

Diabetes is","Yes.\nQuestion: How do I prevent cancer? Complete Answer: There is no cure for cancer except prevention. It may take some time but in the end it will make you healthier than your relatives, friends or neighbors who have not been diagnosed yet. And if they manage to live longer than most people do, then they will likely be even better off than those who died at an earlier age. So it's best to start now. \nQuestion: What is the difference between estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) and hormone replacement therapy (HRT)? Complete Answer: ERT is used only by women who had their ovaries removed due to cancer treatment. HRT is used by men as well as women. There are some differences in side effects, safety, and results with each drug. For more information see https://www.cancerwomenshealth.org/topics/treatment/. \nQuestion: What are the risks of taking birth control pills? Complete Answer: They can lead to breast growth, abnormal uterine bleeding, and infertility. They also cause serious problems with blood clots. The risk of death from heart disease is extremely low. However, this depends on many factors including how long you continue using them and the type of pill you use. In general there has never been any evidence that birth control causes cancer. In addition, there have always been many other benefits of these medications that outweigh any possible risks. \nQuestion: Where should I get a prescription for hormones? Complete Answer: Go to www.emedicare.com and click ""What is My Medication"" and enter ""birth control"". You will receive a list of pharmacies in your area. If there is a pharmacy that sells Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT), then ask for information on HRT prescriptions. You must bring all paperwork to the doctor before receiving your prescription. Your doc will ask for a copy of all documents and you will need to give him permission to see your document. \nQuestion: Is there such thing as too much estrogen? Complete Answer: No. Some people feel uncomfortable when they first start hormonal medication because their body is still adjusting to the change. This is normal. Once your body adapts you can stop taking them without losing any weight. As soon as you finish, you are back at your pre-menstrual state. You may lose some moodiness for a few days after stopping but this usually goes away within a couple weeks.

Question: I'm in my 60s, but still overweight. Is there anything I should do to keep myself healthier? Complete Answer: Unfortunately, no. The most effective treatment for weight loss is losing weight. There's nothing you can do about whether you're still fat or not, only about the amount of weight you lose. For example, if you were 10 pounds heavier and eating 3 pounds less each day, you'd be looking at around a 5% reduction in your waist size - that means that you could still drop five pounds without sacrificing much of your height, because you're actually losing 1/3 of your body mass. You can also achieve a smaller waistline by having sex less often - your metabolism slows down when you're sexually active. And by cutting out all fatty foods (fish, red meat, dairy products) from your diet, you'll feel fuller longer and lose a lot more weight. This is why even people who are currently normal weight have had very positive results following lifestyle changes like quitting smoking, eating better, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and so forth. In fact, in some countries people who quit smoking and followed their recommendations for several years ended up being fatter than they started! So while it may seem as though we've learned everything we know about obesity since the days of John Hughes, nothing could be further from the truth.

Question: My daughter was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. How can I help her? Complete Answer: Most children are able to manage the disease","Yes, it can be! It is the best known chronic disease in America today with over 1 million Americans suffering from diabetes each year.\nQuestion: What diseases are more prevalent in the United States than they have been previously estimated? Complete Answer: \nDiabetes has always been one of the most widely studied conditions but it is now understood that many other chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, high blood pressure and kidney disease are also highly prevalent. The prevalence of these other diseases varies by region of the country and among various demographic groups; however, the general estimate is that diabetes will affect 10% of all U.S. adults by 2025.\nThe prevalence rate for type 2 diabetes alone (those who take insulin at least once per week) increased significantly between 1996 and 2012. In addition, the number of people living with or developing type 1 diabetes increased over this period from 6.9 million to 9.4 million.\nQuestion: What foods should I eat while pregnant/postpartum to prevent type 2 diabetes? Complete Answer: Eat an adequate amount of protein, healthy fats, fiber and vitamins B 12, C and D. However, only those with normal cholesterol levels should consume additional amounts of dairy products (especially skim milk). Low carbohydrate diets may not provide enough energy for your needs, so limit fruit juice and soda. To get enough calcium from vegetables, avoid wheat products, cereals, breads and pasta. For more information on how to maintain good diet habits while you are pregnant or postpartum, visit http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulations/ucm162219.htm.\nQuestion: Does my doctor know if I am diabetic? Complete Answer: Almost certainly. Most doctors believe that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is very low for women in their early 40s, but some do not know because they did not ask their patients about their diabetes status before treating them for hypertension or diabetes. Patients who have had gestational diabetes have a higher chance of having another form of diabetes later on in life which increases their risk of dying prematurely (1). Some doctors also erroneously assume that any woman who has had gestational diabetes knows that she has diabetes, despite the fact that many do not. As long as the diagnosis is confirmed during pregnancy, a mother can be given appropriate treatment for her diabetes without fear of being prescribed medications. If the diagnosis of gestational diabetes was made when the patient was younger, then she is","Yes. Diabetes can be successfully treated with a variety of lifestyle changes including proper nutrition.

When we first learned of the existence of Type 1 Diabetes in 1987, it was thought that its cure could only come from transplantation or by using drugs which were already on the market (such as insulin). In recent years however this has changed with new medicines being developed which have all the qualities of an effective drug. The hope is that once these will become available, people with type 1 Diabetes who want to lose weight without losing blood sugar levels will find these medicines very suitable.\nQuestion: What is the difference between an artificial pancreas and a natural one? Complete Answer: \/P2\nIn order for a person to receive treatment with an artifical pancreas they must be able to produce insulin, which can take up to 6 months to manufacture and is then tested for purity before the recipient receives their medicine. This process takes approximately 10 weeks for the production of insulin. For people with type 2 Diabetes, where there is no such requirement, the treatment involves receiving insulin through a small device called a transducer which measures the amount of insulin produced by the person's own body. As soon as the medication reaches the sensor, the insulin release stops immediately and the patient starts receiving the appropriate dose each day. In general it is safe to use any type of insulin for any type of illness except diabetics (a disease in which insulin doesn't work) but some individuals with diabetes may need extra care or monitoring while taking medications. If you are thinking of getting an artifical pancreas, please consult your doctor about the safety and effectiveness of the device in treating your condition. Once the procedure is approved, it will cost around $3500 and it should take less than one year to be fully functional and usable. However, if it becomes necessary later, there are several options for aftercare, including home insulin pumps which operate automatically when needed and insulin tablets which last for anywhere between 3 days and 9 months.

This condition occurs when the body cannot produce enough insulin for glucose to flow through the bloodstream. Insulin resistance can lead to problems such as uncontrolled weight gain and increased risk for developing type 2 Diabetes. There is currently no cure for this disease, but research has revealed a number of promising treatments that have shown promise in clinical trials.\nQuestion: What is a Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT)?

Answer: A GTT is an oral test administered by your healthcare provider to determine whether you are diabetic or not. You must pass a GTT if your blood sugar level is high enough to cause discomfort. The most commonly used tests include the OGTT or the HbA1c. In some cases, there may also be other tests performed with the same results. The purpose of these tests is to help ensure the patient doesn't become dependent upon medication or diet changes to treat their diabetes. Many patients who fail these tests will still benefit from having the patient's blood sugars checked regularly as it will allow doctors to monitor their progress over time.

However, other factors that can cause serious harm in pregnancy include high blood pressure, infection, diabetes, and certain drugs used during pregnancy such as aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others). These drugs may impair fetal growth, interfere with fetal brain development, cause serious physical or mental disabilities, increase the risk of premature delivery, and affect postpartum depression. For example, some women taking antidepressants while pregnant have had children born with low birth weights, while on long-term antidepressant use. In addition, certain medications used by women who are breast-feeding pose an increased risk of problems with both the mother and the infant. For example, one study found that women taking antidepressants had higher rates of hemorrhage (which involves bleeding into the bloodstream) than nonusers. The same study also showed that mothers treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors experienced higher rates of cesarean section deliveries compared to women not taking SSRI medications. Other drugs may be associated with complications of pregnancy, including antibiotics (for urinary tract infections), hormones, and alcohol, all of which could affect the unborn child. For more information about these potentially harmful effects, see our section on side effects.

What is nutritional yeast allergy and how do I avoid the need for additional food? Complete Answer: There isn't enough research yet to say if nutritional yeast allergies exist. This is likely due to the fact that different brands vary widely in their ingredients, so there's no way to tell which foods you should avoid when buying dietary yeast. It would probably help to check your grocery store's nutrition label before adding nutritional yeast to your diet because they might list only ""natural"" sources of the yeast protein and will usually describe the yeast proteins as ""all natural"". That said, you shouldn't try to avoid any fermented foods. You'll want to follow recommendations from the American Dietetic Association regarding avoiding foods containing lactose, sugar, and animal fats and substituting them for the fermented products.

Some may opt to go directly to a physical therapist or physical therapy center; others might consult a primary care practitioner. The main thing to remember is that no test can replace direct patient interaction with your provider. You should not hesitate to contact your provider when you feel uncomfortable about something he or she said about you. In addition, many providers offer free consultations in order to ensure they understand your situation and are comfortable responding appropriately. See questions below regarding other options for evaluating family members and friends. Question: If I want to learn more about my doctors' diagnoses and treatments, how do I find out? Where should I start? Complete Answer: As much information as possible from your health insurance company and the National Health Insurance Fund. However, these organizations can often give you only vague suggestions on which doctors or hospitals to visit, because their financial resources cannot afford to provide adequate coverage for all services, including mental health care. They should also note that, as part of your standard annual wellness examination, you must be asked for a copy of a current medical report. It may help to ask your provider about his or her diagnosis of depression, anxiety or bipolar disorder, among other conditions. However, just because your doctor has written down the details doesn't mean your treatment plan will necessarily meet those standards. Ask him/her if the medication he prescribed was appropriate for your condition, or if it resulted in side effects or problems. Many physicians will try to reassure you that his advice is based on his best judgment, and will explain why it isn't always necessary to follow the prescription. But please don't take such assurances lightly, since you're taking a gamble with your life. If you are concerned about medication side effects, discuss them with your provider. That way, both you and your provider can make sure you are receiving the medications that are right for you. This may require you to stop your medications temporarily while being monitored by your provider or pharmacist. It might even","Health care professionals use the term ""holistic"" to refer to all aspects of health and disease management that are not primarily focused on symptoms or diseases alone.

What is holistic medicine and what does it include?

Healthcare professionals use the term ""holistic"" to refer to all aspects of health and disease management that are not primarily focused on symptoms or diseases alone. For example, ""holistic"" also includes nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress management, mental well being, and more. Question: How does holistic health work?\nAnswer: The concept of holistic health can be broadly categorized into four main areas: homeopathy, herbalism, naturopathy, and integrative medicine.\nHomeopathic remedies (drugs designed to help heal specific illnesses) may also be used by physicians for other ailments. In addition, certain natural products (e.g., vitamins, minerals, herbs), as well as dietary supplements (such as fish oil and omega-3 fatty acids) have been shown to contain significant amounts of beneficial compounds called antioxidants. \nHerbalists believe that healthy lifestyles help maintain a balance in the body's antioxidant enzymes; however, many modern-day treatments for chronic illnesses such as cancer rely heavily on these same antioxidants. Naturopathic practitioners believe that the healing properties of plants and medicines should be incorporated into the treatment process with regular administration to reduce side effects. \nIntegrative medicine combines conventional and complementary therapies based on scientific principles. Many integrators believe that this form of treatment is much more effective than traditional treatments because they combine traditional treatments with new, emerging ones that target multiple systems. Traditional health approaches tend to focus on symptom reduction through diet, exercise, sleep, stress relief, and medication. But when combined with current research findings showing how the body processes and responds to specific drugs and foods, integrators have been able to develop highly effective strategies to combat chronic conditions like cancer and heart disease. \nQuestion: What are some examples of homeopathic remedies?\nAnswers: Most homeopaths and herbalists recommend using one of two main types of remedy: homeopathic decoction or homeopathic infusion.\nDecoctions are prepared drinks made from ingredients similar to those found in nature, such as dried herbs, roots, leaves, bark, flowers, and spices. They're usually diluted 1:1 or 2:1. Decoctions are often recommended","What is holistic medicine?

Question: Why can't I get my prescription filled at the pharmacy? Complete Answer: You must have a valid prescription from a licensed physician. An open prescription means that you are under the influence of alcohol or drugs and/or may not fully comply with all of your medication instructions. The pharmacy may refuse to fill your prescription if it has been submitted late or without a valid reason for denial. In addition, pharmacies are required by law to keep records on every drug they dispense and you should receive a copy of the order form prior to submitting your request.

Answer: Look for a doctor's name on the prescription label or call the drug company's toll free number to verify that there is no generic drug available through that physician practice.


The most commonly used drugs by specialty pharmacies include all generic versions of over-the-counter (OTC) medications including analgesics, antipsychotics, antihistamines, birth control pills, diabetes medication, cholesterol lowering agents, flu medicines and others. This means that some of these drugs may not need an out-of-network pharmacy (in addition to the regular provider). Additionally, if you choose to receive prescriptions from one of these pharmacies, you should check with your local primary care physicians to ensure that they accept your insurance coverage. Please note that only specialty pharmacists who hold an MD degree can prescribe this type of drugs. The following listing contains only a small portion of the drugs you may find at a specialist pharmacy. However, when seeking information from a specialist pharmacist, ask them how many drugs they dispense. If you want a list of all the major manufacturers of OTC drugs, please click here. \nQuestion: Does the U.S. Food & Drug Administration require that I obtain a special authorization before ordering a prescription drug?

Answer: Yes, the FDA requires that anyone wanting to purchase a prescription drug must first establish that the drug is safe and effective for his or her intended use by evaluating the effectiveness of the patient. There are two requirements for obtaining a special authorization: 1) you must have a valid prescription from your primary care provider; 2) you must meet certain eligibility criteria which can be found here: http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/FoodandDrugAdministrationRegulations/ucm163556.htm \nQuestion: Is there any way that I can get specific directions on where to go for more information about my particular disease?

How can I prevent or manage the most common mental health problems?\nComplete Answer:","This web site is intended for those who have a desire to find out what problems their loved ones experience while living with mental illness. It's important that you're aware of these issues before they become more serious and/or difficult than they already are. If your loved one has a severe mental illness and needs help getting better, please contact an appropriate professional immediately. Your support will be greatly appreciated. \r


Most people with a history of mental illnesses know at some point in their lives that something is wrong. However, many people don't realize until it becomes too much of a problem that it may just be normal and healthy behavior changes that occur over time. For example, someone who had always been very active during childhood may become very withdrawn as adults. Someone who used to work in an occupation where she could get paid often feels less motivated now that she works in a lower paying job. People do this all the time. The following questions might prompt you to think about how these normal behaviors could affect your loved one and determine whether something is seriously wrong:

Do you see any change in your loved one's behavior? Is your loved one taking a different approach to work, school, recreation, social activities, family life, etc.? Do you notice a difference in his or her appearance? Does he or she seem depressed or tired? Are there differences in his or her eating habits (such as weight loss)? Do you notice new symptoms such as anxiety or mood swings? Have other members of the family noticed changes in your loved one? Did others ever say anything bad about him or her? Has anyone else told you about your loved one's behavioral difficulties? Why did you decide to ask me questions about them? Is your loved one doing well, making progress toward recovery or coping with the past? Is there something else bothering your loved one that you haven't seen or heard about? Please write down on a piece of paper or a note the name of the person who wrote the question, date and time the query was received and the title or name of the Web page from which it came. When you send your responses, please include both the name of your loved one and the question he or she answered. \r

2) An outline of the specific service being performed and its purpose.

3) Questions","The major problem with mental health is that it's difficult to diagnose and treat. When you have no idea what's wrong, you're more likely to be anxious and depressed instead of feeling better. But there are some very simple ways to reduce your anxiety and depression: 1) Know what you want in life, 2) know how to get there, 3) take care of yourself so you feel good enough for when you do get there, and 4) know where to find support and resources if needed. You'll also need to learn how to cope with stress and keep it under control. To help increase your self-confidence, seek out positive role models who've overcome their mental health problems. In the meantime, read books on overcoming mental illness, such as my new book, Recovering from Mental Illness. This section includes several articles that discuss the mental health system and symptoms that may lead people to seek treatment.

Why do people become suicidal?

The five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, acceptance, and acceptance \nQuestion: Can a person experience sadness as sadness? If so, what causes this? Complete Answer: Sadness isn't sad because it doesn't satisfy us; rather, it's sad because we don't have anything to give. And it's not a bad thing. It's just that sometimes we make it too painful to face up to our feelings, which makes them worse. So, while your sadness might seem like it's only temporary, it's really more like a long journey. Most people can experience a little bit of sadness during a time of high intensity. Just remember that sadness is usually temporary, not permanent. There are different types of sadness and each type has its own characteristics. For example, low emotional pain (such as fear) has physical effects. High emotional pain (such as anger) has psychological ones. These characteristics don't always reflect the same things that we see as negative emotions. Sometimes people have great difficulty seeing themselves as having low emotional pain, even though they believe that they are experiencing high emotion. Often we don't realize that we often have extreme highs, and vice versa. That said, it's","We have gathered data from over 12,000 Americans who participated in the 2012 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). In this survey, we asked respondents how many people in their household had experienced any mental illness during the past year and how often they experienced an episode of depression, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, substance abuse disorder, or suicidal ideation during that same time period. Of those with any mental disorders, more than 7% said they were diagnosed with an ""affective"" condition, while 2.4% reported having been treated for one such condition, 3.3% were prescribed medication by a doctor, and 1.8% reported treatment for another mental disorder.\nBased on these responses, the NHIS estimated that in 2011, 6.5 million adults—or 11.1% of all U.S. residents aged 18 years and older—experienced at least one mental illness in the previous year. About one in four (26%) adult Americans had experienced both symptoms of depression and schizophrenia in the preceding year.\nFor example, 9.2% of men and 4.7% of women reported being diagnosed with schizophrenia, and 5.0% of men and 2.6% of women had received treatment for either depressive disorder or schizophrenic disorder.\nOther popular questions included whether someone had ever felt like he or she was going crazy or if they'd seen someone commit suicide. The majority (62%) of people surveyed believed that no one has ever gone insane. Just under half (49%) thought it likely no one would ever kill himself or herself; 23.9% said it is possible for people to be ""cured"" through psychotherapy, and 14.4% said it is possible for them to experience ""the full effects"" of a major psychiatric diagnosis. Finally, a quarter of all respondents said they have heard of or used tranquilizers or sedatives. On a separate scale, 41% described themselves as being very concerned about the use of prescription medications, such as antidepressants or antihistamines. This concern has increased considerably since 2007, when only 38% of the population expressed this level of concern.\nThe results of the survey also reveal that approximately one in five adults reported experiencing at least one serious mental illness in the last year. These illnesses include: depression, bipolar disorder, substance abuse disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder,","There are three major types of mental illnesses: depression, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders.

If you do not know the answer to any of these questions, please don't hesitate to ask your doctor for help. Most people who have suffered from some form of mental illness in their life are suffering under one or more of the following major conditions. People who experience depression often suffer from other kinds of mood disorders. Other psychological illnesses may cause symptoms such as anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, lack of concentration, and suicidal ideation. In addition to all of the above mentioned mental disorders, there is also a large number of other health conditions that can occur during the course of a person's lifetime (although it varies greatly by individual). This list includes many common ailments including diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, Parkinson's Disease, cancer, and a wide range of other serious health concerns. The table below provides brief descriptions of each of the major health conditions listed below: Diseases that Can Cause Mental Illness:

What Causes Your Mood Disorder? Depression causes changes in your brain chemistry called ""chemical imbalances."" These chemical imbalances make you feel miserable and depressed. You may not even notice the effects of these imbalances at first, but over time they create unhealthy feelings such as irritability, low self-esteem, loneliness, anger, hopelessness, worry, guilt, and sadness. Depression causes changes in your brain chemistry called ""chemical imbalances."" These chemical imbalances make you feel miserable and depressed. You may not even notice the effects of these imbalances at first, but over time they create unhealthy feelings such as irritability, low self-esteem, loneliness, anger, hopelessness, worry, guilt, and sadness. When depressed, your brain releases substances called neurotransmitters into your body called serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and acetylcholine. These substances act on receptors located throughout your nervous system called neurons. Each neuron has a specific type of receptor that acts as an agent that allows it to communicate with another cell. A particular type of neuron that affects depression is known as a cholinergic neuron. It is believed that this particular type of neuron plays a role in causing your own body to release certain chemicals which have been linked to depression. As an example, if someone had a weak immune system, they would likely develop flu-like symptoms when they felt sick. This is because the body's immune system could be attacking itself; however, since no part of the body has","Many of our readers have questions about mental health that go beyond just ""why"" they suffer from specific symptoms.

Complete Answer:\nAnxiety attacks are dangerous because of their unpredictability and rapidity. This includes those who have recently been diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder, or another mental illness. An anxious person may also experience a panic attack (a sudden outburst of intense emotion), which often causes them to lose control of themselves and to have a panic attack in front of others. It has been estimated by experts that between 20% and 40% of people with a diagnosable anxiety disorder will develop an episode of generalized anxiety within five years of diagnosis, while around 25% to 50% may experience symptoms every day. The average time from onset to a first incident of generalized anxiety lasts one month.

Learn more about self-care steps for those at risk.\nQuestion: How do I know when I've had enough stress and need to take a break from work? \nAnswer: Stress can cause an individual to become restless, hypervigilant, irritable, impatient, and easily bored. If your job forces you to constantly interact with other people and situations, this can lead to boredom, irritability, impatience, and irritation. When you are able to relax and rest, you become less stressed.

Symptoms include sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, lack of energy, feelings of worthlessness, guilt, poor self-image, poor sleep quality, and low self esteem (3) \/

How do you keep yourself happy and healthy? By eating right and exercising regularly. You can improve your overall health with diet and exercise by following a healthy balance between fat intake, protein intake, carbohydrates intake, and fiber intake. For example, consuming only 15 grams of fiber per day is recommended for adults; this amount includes soluble vegetables such as broccoli, peas, carrots, cauliflower, and cabbage. Healthy fats should be limited to 30 percent of total calories while maintaining a normal blood cholesterol level (4,5). Additionally, eat an adequate amount of potassium, magnesium, calcium, and vitamin A to prevent hyperparathyroidism, which contributes to high levels of certain risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause neurological symptoms and can lead to death (6,7). Keepsake Picture: If you have a hard time sleeping, what might trigger it?

\nQuestion: How do I prepare for my first appointment?

\nAnswer: Please have a look at your doctor's description of each type of specialty. Ask questions about the benefits and risks associated with taking each drug. You may also wish to read some related articles and follow up with your doctor if you have additional concerns. Also discuss possible alternative treatments before starting therapy. Your doctor will be able to tell you whether these medications will affect your ability to drive, perform daily tasks, sleep, or engage in sexual activity. Some drugs are more likely than others to cause serious side effects, including high blood pressure, seizures, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, heart failure, and death. Talk to your physician about alternatives to medication. Also, ask your doctor about ways to decrease risk factors for adverse reactions. Consider talking with friends, relatives, or roommates who have had similar experiences. \r

\nQuestion: Should I get my parents' permission before I talk to my doctors about certain changes in my diet?

\nAnswer: Yes. It is very","a structured treatment that helps people to understand their own feelings and experiences, and to use these insights in ways that help them cope with the stresses of life. Question: How often should I take my vitamin B12? Complete Answer: take it as needed for optimal brain function. Question: Is there anything else I need to know about magnesium and supplements? Complete Answer: yes and no. There are two main types of magnesium: Magnesium sulfate (methionine) and Magnesium citrate (sodium). While you can get both at most grocery stores, they're not interchangeable. You'll see many doctors prescribing an over-the-counter form of magnesium sulfate such as Magnesium Citrate 100% MgSO4 or Magnesium Cetearate 200%. These are both fine if your doctor has prescribed them, but be sure to ask your pharmacist if any have been added to your prescription. If you don't feel better after taking one tablet, talk to your physician about switching brands. One study showed that people who took either magnesium sulfate or citrate had higher levels of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex than those given magnesium only. \nAsk Dr. Money: What's your favorite way to relax? Complete Answer: I like to exercise a lot. My favorite times to do so include the day before work and during weekends. That also allows me plenty of time to meditate by myself in my favorite quiet place. It also means I can do my breathing exercises right before bed when I'm feeling stressed out. I think this can actually help me sleep less efficiently since I stop thinking about things all night long. The key with relaxing though is to find a comfortable position where your body doesn't move too much. Also, try to avoid stressful situations whenever possible. If something happens at school, family emergencies, and other events, let go of any anxiety and just enjoy the moment.

In addition, some people may have other symptoms related to GAD, such as hyperarousal (feeling anxious, tense, and/or restless), inability to sleep, mood swings, and unusual sexual behavior.\nOCD is characterized by abnormal patterns of thinking and behaviour, which can include feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness. Some people may be hypersensitive to criticism, and those who experience this should seek help immediately.\nI am suffering from chronic pain.

In addition to providing factual, objective information on an issue related to one's life, psychoanalysis can provide emotional support, insight into inner problems, and insight into how other people see themselves and their lives. It can help people understand their feelings and thoughts so they don't get caught up in them and prevent harmful self-destructive behaviors. It also helps people make sense of events and situations without being led astray by emotions or beliefs. When using psychoanalysis, one needs to be sensitive to people's reactions and needs. People have different reasons for wanting to seek psychological counseling from you; some may need to talk about significant personal issues that they feel uncomfortable discussing publicly. They might just want to find someone who will listen sympathetically and give them honest advice. Others may ask you specific questions about matters that they have been concerned about but weren't able to bring to your attention before. If you believe a person has serious concerns about mental health and wants to discuss those issues with you, you should begin by asking him or her if he or she feels comfortable sharing any of the following with you: His or her name and address

His or her age, sex, race, religion, nationality, political ideology, job title, location where he or she works, and the nature of his or her work (e.g., sales, manufacturing, teaching)

The name and address of anyone else associated with the organization where he or she works

A list of all employers that he or she worked at previously and any new employer that he or she has recently joined

Any recent changes to this individual's physical appearance

What he or she was doing while under psychiatric care (i.e., whether he or she had been treated for depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or another illness or disability)

How long ago he or she first experienced problems

Whether he or she believes that problems are getting worse

You can't just read books on it; you need to talk face-to-face with them to get the full effect.\nQuestion: where do I find information about natural therapies? Complete Answer: Read everything that has an organic (or ""natural"") component. If your doctor tells you ""nothing works"", then don't believe him or her, go ahead and try something new. And if you're not sure what's in your body, call your physician and ask him/her!\nQuestion: why am I getting acne? Complete Answer: Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The skin needs sunlight to reproduce. For this reason, most women will have their period during the summer months. In addition, some women have trouble keeping their periods because they may be taking oral contraceptives. What can happen? Well, there's nothing wrong with the hormones but hormonal birth control pills can interfere with ovulation. If you take these as well, you may have vaginal dryness for several weeks after menstruation starts. This could cause inflammation in your vagina, which would also affect the skin and make your skin more sensitive and prone to infections. Therefore, many women avoid using oral contraceptives, which results in acne and other issues.\nQuestion: why does my hair look different than normal?\nComplete Answer: Hair follicles contain small glands called follicle-stimulating hormone receptors. These stimulate the growth of healthy hairs by releasing certain chemicals into the environment. Because women are born with naturally occurring hair follicles, our faces grow hair before we start puberty, so that we might eventually wear a wig and have a natural hairstyle when we leave home. When we stop growing our hair, however, there is no longer any way to produce additional hair. So what happens in women who stop growing hair? They experience thinning hair lines. Some women also lose their ability to use their hands, teeth, eyes, ears, nose, tongue, lips, throat, stomach, and bladder and develop gagging symptoms including difficulty swallowing and constipation.\nQuestion: Why do girls have such fine hair?\nAnswer: Your brain makes the hair follicles and produces the hormones that stimulate them. When your brain is not active and your pituitary gland doesn't release enough of the hormone prolactin, the hair becomes coarse and coarse.\nQuestion: How can I improve my health? Complete Answer: Exercise, eat right, keep a strong immune system,","Psychological therapies include both Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Psychodynamic Psychotherapy. These therapies address the underlying issues that affect people's emotional functioning or psychological well being in various ways, such as stress, anxiety, depression, anger, guilt, self-blame, and hopelessness. It can be used to help you feel better, work through difficult emotions, increase your sense of purpose, improve life choices, change unwanted behaviors, or solve problems in daily living. Some forms of CBT have been shown to be effective for specific mental health disorders or conditions. Other forms of therapy may not be effective for all persons, but it will generally be more successful for those who are already feeling good and happy.

\nQuestion: what is cognitive behavioral therapy?\nAnswer: CBT is an intervention based on the scientific fact that we all make mistakes, so it helps us learn from our experiences and correct them when they occur. People use CBT to overcome their own irrational beliefs and behavior patterns, and ultimately make meaningful changes within themselves and in their lives. In some cases, people need to work with a therapist to develop new goals in order to meet the needs of their individual situation.

Please read our Health Knowledge Center article for further information on this topic.\nQuestion: What is the difference between a psychiatric hospital and a psychiatric emergency room?

Answer: A psychiatric emergency room (PE) is one of several specialized units operated by health care providers who specialize in treating individuals who present with symptoms indicating a potential threat of serious harm to themselves, others, or society. These patients typically require long-term treatment, with intensive supervision, to correct underlying psychiatric causes of their problems. PEs often consist of an internal medicine team, nurses, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists and clinical social workers. An emergency department (ED) is a place where the staff treats persons presenting with acute illness or injury, which may necessitate immediate admission. In addition to providing necessary care and support during these times, PEs also serve as places for community outreach, education and cultural learning. There is no single definition of a psychiatric emergency room, but it generally includes both a psychiatric hospital and a residential center. The majority of PEs are licensed under state laws. Many states now have specific licensing requirements for PEs.

Answer: Searching your physician's prescription record using the keywords ""Prescription Drug"" will give you all the relevant data needed to answer this question. If your physician has prescribed medications in the past, a search will reveal whether the medication was issued before July 1, 2010. If the medication was approved after July 1, 2010, you must ask your doctor why he or she chose to write the medication. For example, how did you learn that the medication was being prescribed? Did your physician offer you alternative options? Was there another drug you could be taking without side effects? Questions regarding medications should not take up too much space; however, they are important because a good understanding of drugs can make finding a new prescription easier.\nQuestion:","Psychotherapy (also known as psychoanalytic therapy) is the study of human behavior and personality by using techniques derived from psychoanalysis and philosophy. This means that it deals with how people think and feel, develop character and relationship skills, understand their emotions and motivations, and manage stress.

What is self-help therapy? Self-help therapy is an approach to help individuals develop meaningful and lasting change in ways that address underlying problems rather than relying solely on external treatments and interventions. Self-help therapists seek to identify the root causes of symptoms that have been causing them distress, then work with clients to resolve those issues through practical strategies they choose themselves. By identifying and resolving personal conflicts, self-help practitioners create new opportunities for positive growth, resulting in happier lives. Learn more at http://www.selfhelptherapy.com/.

Why does someone need to be in treatment? Treatment for mental illness is not only important for the person receiving treatment but also for society at large. Research shows that treating people who experience mental illnesses can improve the quality of life of others as well as promote social support and reduce stigma associated with mental illnesses. In addition, there is evidence showing that mental illnesses can affect people's relationships and work performance. These effects may last long after the patient leaves treatment. For example, while treatment may relieve some symptoms of anxiety, many of these symptoms return when patients return home or if they become involved in other activities. Furthermore, because most cases of mental illness do not require hospitalization, many people will go untreated until they're ready to seek treatment.

Is mental illness a lifestyle choice? Mental illness is often diagnosed based on symptoms alone. However, recent studies suggest that psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are related to genetic factors. Learn more at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22147511"

Symptoms may start in childhood or as an adult, can affect both men and women, and vary from person to person. MS causes fatigue, pain, and other symptoms, often with little warning. The disease progresses over time, typically after 5 years. When symptoms do appear, they're usually severe, such as muscle stiffness, numbness and weakness, confusion, loss of vision, or difficulty speaking. Your doctor will determine whether you have MS based on your symptoms alone and your overall health history. It's important to speak to your primary care provider if you think you may be at risk for MS. You should also consult a specialist who specializes in MS. In addition, you might consider getting screened for certain cancers. For more information about this issue, see How to Get Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis. \r

Example: A woman tells her doctor she feels tired all the time during the day but doesn't have any trouble sleeping; however, her sleep apnea keeps waking her up at night. Her doctor will likely diagnose her with fibromyalgia syndrome, which means her illness is characterized by frequent bouts of painful muscles.

Question: I'm concerned about my cat's behavior. Is it normal to have different patterns of anger or irritation toward people when he gets angry? If so, how much difference does it make to him? Answer: Cats sometimes get ""angry"" when upset. This happens because their brains have evolved to respond instinctively to situations that cause distress. So, whenever cats experience discomfort, they may exhibit these behaviors. Examples include snapping, scratching at objects, biting and even urinating on furniture. Cat owners need not worry too much about what their pets are doing when they become agitated. They'll usually calm down soon enough once the situation passes, although some owners say that their dogs don't always behave well around cats.\n","Multiple Sclerosis is an umbrella term that refers to at least 2 different kinds of progressive neurodegenerative diseases: Sjogren's syndrome (also called Lewy bodies disease) and demyelinating polyneuropathy. Both conditions can affect the nervous system and cause symptoms ranging from mild to severe, including memory loss and mental confusion, as well as muscle weakness and joint pain. Although they may appear similar, there are also many important differences between them. The most prominent difference involves how the disease progresses, and in which direction. Sjogren's is characterized by long periods of relatively slow and gradual degeneration of neurons in the brain stem; whereas, Demyelinating Polyneuropathy develops with nerve damage throughout the body, leading to chronic inflammation and disability.\n

Answer: \/PATTERN of question\nThe two terms are not interchangeable because they refer to distinct causes. A person who has progressive (remitting) Sjogren's may be able to lead normal lives but will often have long, persistent and debilitating neurological deficits. Conversely, someone whose primary disorder is Demyelinating Polyneuropathy, would likely experience disability and lifelong impairment regardless of whether he or she developed Sjogren's or a secondary autoimmune disorder (such as rheumatoid arthritis).

It is characterized by inflammation of blood vessels in your brain, spinal cord, lymph nodes, and nerves. The inflammation causes changes within cells, including myelin sheath, which provides structural insulation between nerve fibers and helps them conduct electrical signals. \nAnswer: If you have MS, then yes, it changes your life. This disorder involves abnormal formation of scar tissue around the edges of nerve endings throughout your body, causing paralysis or loss of sensation in affected areas. In many cases, the disease progresses slowly and requires intensive treatment, such as surgery, radiation therapy, and daily medication. However, in some people with MS, symptoms can progress rapidly or appear suddenly after the initial attack. You may notice a decrease in strength and coordination at first. As time goes on, you may also experience joint pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, muscle spasms, seizures, loss of vision, hearing, and balance problems. Treatment typically includes several steps: medications; diet adjustments; physical therapy and speech therapy; and home and community activities such as exercise and social support groups. \nAnother important question is what types of treatments are available for this disorder. There are two main categories of therapies. Most commonly used are anti-inflammatory drugs (such as NSAIDs), calcium channel blockers, and other forms of neuroprotective agents such as benzodiazepines and antidepressants. Other options include genetic counseling, lifestyle modifications, and education to help you learn more about MS. All of these methods will take time and effort to accomplish successfully, so it's best to find out about all your options in advance. Many doctors don't know much about MS until they've treated their own patients. They do not yet understand how different types of therapies work and if any should be tried before going back to someone else. For example, it could be wise to seek advice from a doctor who has treated MS before in order to get a feel for the kind of results he/she gets when treating patients with similar conditions. Also ask to see a report from a neurologist before starting a new drug regimen or having your existing therapy changed.\nQuestion: How long does it take me to recover from MS?

The condition usually begins in childhood or adolescence and can be lifelong. You can get MS if you have a mutation in a gene called the X chromosome (male sex chromosomes). Your risk for developing MS increases with each passing year. Women and men who inherit one copy of this same mutated gene from both parents will develop MS, too. If you have multiple copies of the damaged gene, your chances of getting MS increase. People with this disorder often have physical problems like arthritis, but they also may experience cognitive issues, such as difficulty with memory and attention span, which can make them less productive at work and school. Although some people with MS have a milder form of the illness, others progress rapidly. As more research on MS continues, our understanding will improve; however, there's no cure. In fact, new medications are being developed, including the anti-inflammatory drug infliximab. However, treatment doesn't always result in full recovery. Learn More About MS »","Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nerves. Symptoms may not always be apparent on an exam. Some symptoms are progressive and irreversible, while others are temporary or treatable with medication. Treatment options vary among different types of MS, as do the risks associated with each approach. If you have questions about your own condition, please see your doctor immediately. \r

In general, MS appears after age 65 years, but symptoms typically appear earlier. The disease is generally self-limited in severity and usually resolves without treatment. While people with MS often experience significant loss of motor function, other conditions can impair their ability to work normally or perform daily activities. To prevent relapse or improve symptoms, follow these steps: \r

First, make sure your neurologist knows which type of MS you have. Most people who live with MS will eventually need surgery for removal of the diseased nerve cells and their surrounding tissues. You might also want to speak to your cardiologist, neurologist, psychiatrist, or nurse practitioner, if they don't already know. Your primary care physician might refer you to them for more information.\r

Next, find out what causes MS and how effective treatments work. As an example, consider how much time your body has left before your symptoms worsen. How long is too long? For example, someone with advanced multiple sclerosis may only require a few months of therapy before his symptoms become severe enough to warrant further intervention. A patient suffering from milder forms of the disease should receive no more than six months of treatment. Take this into consideration when choosing your treatment plan. The longer you wait to start treatment, the greater the risk that your treatment could fail because it's ineffective or the benefits are inadequate. Before starting any treatment, talk to your doctor about all possible alternatives. They can help guide you toward the best course of action. If you think you or someone else has MS, tell anyone who might need support to take a look at your health record at the National Center for Health Statistics in Bethesda, Maryland. There you'll find your current address and the name of your local MS clinic. Ask your doctor whether the person's condition qualifies you for assistance under the Medically Assisted Medicare Program (MedPAC).

In MS, there are several primary causes that can be diagnosed in adults (Mendelian transmission), children (primary demyelinating agents), or pediatric patients (inflammatory processes). At this time, there are no known treatments for MS. One treatment option is to use systemic therapies, which include intravenous immunoglobulin G (IgG) therapy for severe cases; corticosteroids for moderate-to-severe cases; and anti-TNF drugs, such as propranolol (Prilosec); for milder cases. All three types of MS medications may help reduce symptoms, but it is important not to overuse them or to take more than prescribed due to possible side effects. For example, long-term oral steroids used to treat active MS may have detrimental effects on bones, joints, and blood vessels, which can lead to osteoporosis.

At this time, there are no known treatments for MS. One treatment option is to use systemic therapies, which include intravenous immunoglobulin G (IgG) therapy for severe cases; corticosteroids for moderate-to-severe cases; and anti-TNF drugs, such as propranolol (Prilosec); for milder cases. All three types of MS medications may help reduce symptoms, but it is important not to overuse them or to take more than prescribed due to possible side effects. For example, long-term oral steroids used to treat active MS may have adverse effects on bones, joints, and blood vessels, which can lead to osteoporosis. Question: What are some signs and symptoms of MS?

Answer: Symptoms are many, ranging from fatigue to blurred vision to difficulty speaking. Some people do not get any symptoms at all until after they get the first sign. Examples include fatigue; cognitive impairment; numbness and tingling feeling on one hand and both feet; and difficulties with movement and balance. Other common symptoms seen in MS include joint pain, skin lesions, eye problems, and facial swelling. While these symptoms vary widely between individuals, most people experience a number of them within 5 years of starting MS medication. With proper diagnosis, these symptoms can","Start with your doctor and go from there. You can also try the MS Support Center website at http://mssupportcenter.com/ MS Support Center provides an online list of resources for people with MS symptoms (http://www.MSSupportCenter.com/Resources/Symptoms). The information is organized into three areas: 1) Diagnosis and Treatment 2) Education 3) Patient Resources and Care 4) Health Policy and Practice \r

A number of MS support centers are available throughout the country, some of which may be able to provide more comprehensive or specific information than others. It's important to remember that people with MS often have different needs than those who do not. For example, someone who has had MS for many years might not need as much help as someone just starting out on their road to recovery. When you're looking for information, it's best to speak directly with your primary care physician, who will give you more specific guidance than if you contact other individuals or organizations through the Internet. This will allow you to get the most appropriate information in a timely fashion. \r

One benefit of having an MS support center is that they will answer questions that have been posed to them by consumers, including things like how long does MS take to recover? What treatments work best for patients with MS? Do I need any special medications or supplements when recovering from MS? If so, what is the right dose for me? Are there any side effects of certain drugs? Is there anything else that could possibly be contributing to my recovery? These kinds of questions and more can help you find solutions to problems you might otherwise never discover. In addition, while you'll probably never know exactly what causes your symptoms, you can expect that these issues will always be part of your life and likely won't disappear overnight, even after you've recovered. So please don't hesitate to reach out to anyone who can help you. The MS Support Center will continue to provide valuable information as new findings become known and new methods of therapy become available. MS Support Center is also happy to assist you with your own diagnosis of MS by providing information on the most effective treatment options for people suffering from the disease. Many people can use this information, but only those with documented MS symptoms can receive proper clinical evaluation and treatment. Some people cannot afford to pay for the cost of such tests and treatments, while others simply want to minimize any risk associated with taking medication. Therefore, it makes sense for MS support centers to offer a variety of services to help people understand what the condition","With the use of your MS Question Solution, we will help you get the most from each question by providing the right information at the right time in an easy-to-read format.

MS Answer Page","In most cases, you can stop taking MS medication entirely (as long as it is not harmful). There are several options for managing this condition. The first is called ""treatment with steroids"". This method of treatment has been recommended by many people because it works better than the other two methods (including placebo) in some patients. If you have an autoimmune disease or any serious illness that might affect your immune system such as HIV/AIDS or cancer, you may want to consider this option. After the steroid regimen stops working, you will be at risk of catching something from the drug. This could be anything from bacteria to viruses, or even cancer cells or tumors. You should not take drugs (other than those prescribed for you by your doctor), if you believe they are causing any side effects. It's very important for your doctor to tell you what is safe when trying to treat MS (including getting injections, using steroids, or administering immunosuppressive medications like corticosteroids and warfarin).\end_questions


Q: What do I need to know about my insurance policy before asking questions regarding my illness?

A: Before you ask questions, determine whether there is any benefit or risk associated with the treatment you're considering. Do you feel comfortable discussing your illnesses with someone else without first obtaining an official diagnosis from your primary care physician? For example, do you think you would be comfortable having a friend or relative discuss your symptoms with a family member or close friend without first doing an interview by yourself? Many people who experience MS feel more comfortable if they get their diagnoses directly from their physicians. However, if you don't already have a good understanding of your coverage, contact your state insurance agency or go online (www.nccareer.org/index.cfm) and look up the cost of your plan. A general rule of thumb is $1,500 for individuals and $3,000 for families. You must also make sure you understand all of the available benefits under each coverage type. Even though MS does sometimes require prescription drugs, you should pay for them out of pocket because there isn't enough money left over after deductibles, co-pays, and other charges. Don't forget about preventive services such as regular checkups, vaccinations, and blood work. These activities help prevent future illnesses from occurring. Also remember that your insurer typically pays 100% of costs related to long term disability or death. Finally, keep in mind that there are limitations to how much you can expect your doctor to cover","A guide for managing multiple sclerosis is available from the MS Foundation, as well as other resources.\nQuestion: What are the differences between different types of fibromyalgia? \NONE.

Q. Why do I not get better after using the antidepressant Prozac or Zoloft? This happens because the drugs block serotonin receptors within neurons in the brain, making them less sensitive to the neurotransmitter dopamine. The ""lack of action"" causes the brain cells that make serotonin, called serotonin neurons, to die off. When the cells cease functioning properly, symptoms appear. Prozac and Zoloft have been associated with increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors; they can cause heart problems, kidney failure, and even death.

When it comes to the use of antidepressants, there are three main classes of drugs — selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). They work by inhibiting enzymes involved in cell metabolism which produces chemicals required for normal body function. These chemical reactions begin when an enzyme breaks down neurotransmitters into their components, which then pass through blood vessels to specific nerve endings in the body. This process normally takes place 24 hours a day. However, some SSRIs act differently in the brain than the rest of the body, causing excessive serotonin production and reduced levels of various neurotransmitters within cells. Therefore, if a patient taking these drugs experiences symptoms of depression, she will often develop suicidal feelings or actions, particularly if she tries to stop taking the medication. As a result, physicians should watch","\nYour main goal is to improve the quality of your life by managing chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) symptoms through rest and exercise.

""I would recommend this book to anyone who feels they may have MS. The authors provide thoughtful guidance and many resources which can help those struggling to cope with their illness."" -Penny Saffron, MA, N.O., RN

""...it is a beautiful combination of scientific research and human stories. It provides a comprehensive account of what MS really is and makes clear just how challenging this disease can be. It is a wonderful read and I look forward to reading more books like this one in the future."" -Mark A. Wilson, Ph. D., Author and Founder of ScienceBasedHealth","If you have MS, we can help you find effective treatments that help you stay well and healthy in the long run. For example, there is evidence suggesting that certain medicines and other therapies may be effective for MS if used frequently enough over time. There is more than one treatment option, but all of them should be considered as part of an overall treatment plan. Some forms of therapy, such as anti-inflammatory medications, are available only at a doctor's office. Other types of therapy require regular monitoring and/or follow up visits. You might want to consider looking into the use of acupuncture (in addition to standard care) or physical exercise with the goal of improving your symptoms. Also consider how these therapies may interact with drugs (such as those that affect blood sugar levels). A variety of different approaches to managing MS may work best for you. Consider these options:\nAsk Your Doctor About Side Effects Medications commonly prescribed for MS include:

Medication Side Effect Drug Effect(s) Acetaminophen (Tylenol, etc.) Inhibits acetylcholine receptors (which control muscle contraction), reduces pain

Decreases energy levels, decreases appetite, increases fatigue, improves depression, memory loss. Amiodarone (Tagamet) Increases blood pressure, dizziness, irritability, insomnia, restlessness, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain, shortness of breath, fever, increased pulse rate, chest tightness, tachycardia, tremors. Barbiturates (Valium, etc.) Decrease sleep quality, increase mood swings, decrease concentration, cause drowsiness.

Cautions and Cautions Associated With Use of Certain Drugs Before prescribing a drug to treat an MS diagnosis, it is important to discuss any potential risks associated with the drug with your physician. These potential risks are outlined below.","It is difficult to determine the optimal therapy for MS patients. In addition, effective treatment options have not been established in many instances. Therefore, MS patients must be counseled on which therapies to try first, how to select an appropriate doctor or therapist, and when and how to initiate therapy.


Answer: MS is an ongoing illness that affects a person's ability to move around, speak, think, hear, see, smell, touch, taste, smell again, see again, feel pain, understand language, make decisions, learn new skills, and perform basic functions. The disease can cause chronic disability, which may last years after diagnosis. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of several types of autoimmune diseases, which affect most people throughout their lives. There are currently more than 50 different kinds of MS, each with its own specific symptoms, causes, and complications.


The exact nature of MS varies greatly from individual to individual. Some forms include relapsing remitting MS, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and focal segmental glaucoma (FSG). These three types of MS share some characteristics: the disease is largely controlled by immune cells called T cells; it progresses over time; the disease results in damage to peripheral nervous systems (eyes, skin, etc.); and there is limited response to standard treatment. But, while all three of these types of MS share a general feature in that they often involve peripheral vision loss, they do not share a specific feature in that the severity of the lesions vary considerably and/or the medications used to treat them differ widely. For example, PML can leave few if any signs or symptoms behind but does have severe nerve damage; FSG leaves no obvious sign of injury but involves extensive damage to nerves and body tissues; and PML may result in a life-long disability even after the disease has been controlled or cured.","When symptoms occur, you may have 2 or more MS disease states (MSD). One MSD may be triggered by an underlying condition such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or chronic Lyme disease (LD), and the other MSD may be triggered by another reason. The best way to know which MSDs to treat is to use MSD classification systems developed by experts in each field of medicine, like: neurologists/neurosurgeons; endocrinologists/endocrinologists; cardiologists/cardiologists; respiratory therapists/respiratory therapists; oncologists/oncologists, who specialize in diseases of the central nervous system; psychiatrists/psychiatrists; and allergists/allergists.

The following list summarizes the most frequently used terms that are found in this booklet. Other terms, however, can also be used, but they should not be mistaken for MSD terminology.

In addition to these terms, it might help to consult the MSD Classification System and its accompanying glossary at the American Academy of Neurology Web site.

Common Questions About MSD

What does 'Primary' mean?


When someone has MSD, he/she usually has both primary and secondary MSD. Primary MSD refers to symptoms caused by the primary illness. Secondary MSD refers to secondary illnesses caused by the second disease state. Some people with a secondary diagnosis of MSD will have no pain, fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or joint swelling associated with their second MSD. Many patients without symptoms will respond well to treatment even though they do not have two separate types of disease. In fact, some physicians will diagnose MSD without knowing that there may be secondary forms. Therefore, it is important to obtain a thorough physical examination, laboratory tests, and other testing before making any decision regarding treatment. If you suspect that your patient has secondary MSD, or if you feel uncomfortable asking questions about MSD due to the sensitivity of the subject matter, seek assistance from a physician or psychologist knowledgeable in the topics discussed below.","Learn about the MS symptoms and causes from your doctor; how you can prevent or control them; what medications work best for the particular condition; how you can improve quality of life for yourself and others in the long term; and what can be done to ensure that future generations will not suffer from the disease and all its complications. This information may help you make informed decisions on your own or with an MS care team.\nQuestion: What is ""allergies""? Complete Answer: Allergies are diseases (including allergies) that cause severe inflammation of the body's immune system.\nQuestion: What does cancer mean when it means ""cancer""? \nAnswer: Cancer includes any type of tumors such as breast, colon, rectal, prostate, lung, brain and other cancers. The specific types of these cancers differ by location and tumor type, but most cancers can occur at any age and have many different stages. Many people die from cancer as they get older; however, some people survive longer than expected due to treatment options available today.

When you see the symptoms of multiple sclerosis, they may be signs of one or more conditions that are all in your body, or other causes not yet fully understood. For example, you may have pain as your brain tries to heal itself from damage caused by the inflammatory process that leads up through your spinal cord to affect your peripheral nervous system (which controls things like muscle spasms). You may also feel weakness as muscles get weaker and can't control movement as you age. These are just some examples of diseases that develop at different rates or when people are older than normal.\nQuestion: What are the four major types of MS? Complete Answer: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) occurs as part of an autoimmune disease called rheumatoid arthritis. In this case, it's a systemic immune reaction triggered by the bacteria in our guts, known as enteropathogens, which produce chemicals that attack the lining of our blood vessels, causing inflammation. The condition affects the nerves that deliver messages to the brain, affecting your vision, speech, balance, thinking, memory, coordination, and sensation in your hands, feet, arms, neck, and face. It's often accompanied by other problems such as fever, joint swelling, nausea, weight loss, fatigue, depression, memory impairment, seizures, numbness/tingling, and paralysis. Many people with MS will experience the following symptoms: difficulty walking

weakness in limbs

vision changes

fatigue

muscle cramps

sensitivity to light

dizziness

memory loss

difficulty concentrating

headaches

anxiety

joint and skin lesions and infections

problems talking and swallowing

feeling dizzy

seizures

swelling of lymph nodes

loss of feeling in certain areas

changes in hearing or vision \nOther symptoms include fever, swollen glands, high temperature, poor appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, and increased risk for blood clots. Your doctor might recommend various medications to help treat these issues, but treatment depends on whether you're going into remission or progressing further. If you're already managing some symptoms of MS and you decide to start taking medications, your doctor will make sure that they work well together. They'll look at how frequently you take the medication, how","The following is the general information on MS stages for women in the United States:


MS stage 1 - Mild disability (no symptoms)


MS stage 2 - Mild or moderate disability (symptoms are present but do not require treatment)


MS stage 3 - Severe disability (severe pain, swelling, and stiffness of muscles/joints)


MS stage 4 - Very severe disability (bleeding from joints, loss of muscle strength and range of motion, loss of vision and hearing)


If you want to find out more about this disease, we recommend that you seek expert advice from your doctor. Our website also contains information on treating MS.

Do I need an MRI? You may be asked to have a CT scan (computed tomography) performed at some time during your treatment program. These scans can reveal signs and symptoms of MS as well as help determine if there are any underlying disorders causing the condition. It's generally recommended that if your doctor does order a scan that it will take place within two weeks after beginning treatment (after six months you should expect to see improvement). However, many people have good results with regular checkups for several years without needing an MRI.


When would I start treatment with Cymbalta? If your primary care physician prescribes Cymbalta, he or she will prescribe starting you off slowly with low doses each week until you notice significant benefit. Your doctor could also suggest switching to higher dose Cymbalta when you begin experiencing serious side effects such as joint pain. After you reach 20 mg, most patients experience a gradual increase in dosage over several months. For example, once your baseline dose of 40 mg has been reached, 50 mg will gradually become a daily dose. At 10 mg, 150 mg becomes 200 mg. If you are taking Cymbalta in combination with other medications, ask your doctor about dosing adjustments. As mentioned above, there is no specific minimum dose of Cymbalta you must follow. If you feel discomfort using Cymbalta, don't use it. The amount you should consume depends on how much you're already taking and how far along you've progressed. Don't miss doses!

The information below is based on my personal experiences in treating MS as well as others' opinions and experience. Please read carefully before you write an answer. \nQuestion 1. What is MS? \nAnswer 2.What is the difference between multiple sclerosis (MS) and multiple sclerosis complex (MSC)? \nQuestion 3. Is there any cure for MS? \nAnswer 4. Does MS affect women more than men? If yes, how much less likely do they have MS? A survey of MS patients by Dr. E.B. Trenholme found that men had significantly lower odds of being diagnosed with MS than did women. This was true regardless of age or gender. Women also had significantly higher odds of having been treated successfully for MS compared to men. A study published in the British Medical Journal found that patients who received a diagnosis of MS within three years of beginning treatment had a 75% chance of living with the disease for at least five years. Of those individuals who died, nearly half were under 40 years old. There have not yet been studies examining what factors contribute to the likelihood of dying from MS. However, it seems clear that the longer someone stays sick and the greater their pain, the lower their chances of surviving MS. There are several reasons why people may be more likely to die from MS: 1. The risk of death increases over time; 2. People with MS can develop chronic diseases such as cancer; 3. They take longer to recover than other people; and 4. Some treatments have known side effects that increase the likelihood of illness occurring. For example, medications that decrease immune response or interfere with hormone production, including corticosteroids, can cause inflammation in the body. The more inflammatory the conditions are, the greater the number of illnesses a person can expect to survive. The body's immune system has evolved to fight off infection. When the immune system is suppressed, it responds poorly to stressors that trigger an attack. This may result in multiple sclerosis. Therefore, an individual whose immune system is suppressed by medications may respond to symptoms and signs associated with MS without experiencing long term disability. Another factor in increased mortality among people with MS is alcohol use during periods of remission. In a 2006 study published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers reported that more than 20% of people who stopped drinking at some point after recovery from MS developed relapsing-remitting forms of the disease after returning to normal life. Additionally, research done in France found","\n\nThe following is the general outline of a typical MS disease progression from the earliest symptoms (1 - 3 months old) through adulthood and beyond. \begin{equation} \label{A2}\end{equation} What follows are specific questions that may help you answer this question as well as many others.\nQuestion 1: When was your first major symptom?

and \label","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that affects the brain, spinal cord, immune system, and peripheral tissues. It is diagnosed with abnormal changes in white blood cells called neutrophils and other types of cells. This disorder results in fatigue, numbness, weakness, balance problems, joint pain, vision loss, cognitive problems, and difficulty swallowing. The disease also can affect how your muscles contract or relax. If you have MS, it may cause more symptoms than if you don't have the disease. Symptoms can include problems with memory, concentration, speech, movement, swallowing, and coordination. Treatment for MS includes medication, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and sometimes surgery. There are two main forms of treatment: drugs and home remedies. Drugs work by inhibiting the body's own production of certain chemicals known as cytokines. These chemical messengers help control inflammation during a flare-up of the disease or an infection. Some of these drugs are approved for use to treat other conditions, such as high cholesterol. Home remedies include herbs, minerals, vitamins, and natural therapies, including massage, acupuncture, aromatherapy, yoga, acupressure, chiropractic care, and chiropractic adjustments. You should always talk with your doctor before using any medicine or home remedy. Follow up appointments may be needed after you stop taking the drug.

Complete Answer: There is no specific test for fibromyalgia. You may have some fatigue, pain, headaches, numbness, depression, and other symptoms depending on how much activity you do. However, there are many factors that can cause these symptoms, including certain foods, stress, exercise, medications and infection. As such, it's very hard to predict which patients will show up at the doctor's office due to their fibromyalgia symptoms. This type of diagnosis also makes for more confusing paperwork and more appointments. In addition, it's important to note that there is no cure for fibromyalgia, and this disorder can affect anyone and everyone.

The following are resources from the American Foundation for Health Information that may help you learn more about Fibromyalgia:","\nThe first and most serious disease stage of MS is the early-onset type called primary progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PPML). The second and third types of PPL are progressive neurodegeneration and relapsing-remitting MS. Each has its own name and signs and symptoms.\nFigure 1: Early-Onset PPL and Progressive Neurodegenerative Disease in Adults\nExample question: What does it mean to have ""early-onset"" progressive neurodegenerative disease?

For more information on how MS affects people differently by race, see www.cancerresearch.gov/MS/MSRace/","This is a good question because the answer depends on several factors such as when you first became ill, what stage of MS you have now, how long it has been since you got sick, what other medical conditions your family may also be suffering from or if you yourself are prone to MS symptoms. If someone has no memory loss (as in an Alzheimer's patient) then your doctor will know that you have the disease before you developed this condition, but they won't necessarily tell you that you've had more than one attack, for example. They'll just say it happened at some point after age 20.\nQuestion: Why is my blood sugar so high? Complete Answer: Your body uses glucose as fuel for energy. The higher your blood sugar level, the less likely you are to eat enough food to maintain healthy weight. People with diabetes who try to control their blood sugar with medications usually end up gaining weight while losing muscle mass and bone density. When blood sugars rise above 140 mg/dl then people need to take insulin injections or be put on a diet. Some people get used to having very low levels of blood sugar (less than 100 mg/dl) during times of illness; others don't even notice it happens until something bad happens and they're out of insulin shots or dieting.\nQuestion: How do I remove fat from my stomach? Complete Answer: One way is by eating a whole-food diet that includes lots of vegetables and fruits. Other methods include doing a ""slow"" workout program like yoga or running or taking a probiotic supplement. It's not the only option, however, because many different foods can affect how much fat you lose through digestion or absorption.

Complete Answer: There is currently little research on this topic, although there is increasing evidence that our body will release certain hormone secretions into the air we breathe after we die. These substances are known as metabolites. However, these compounds are difficult to detect and are rarely measured in humans. The main thing you must keep in mind is that when death occurs you will still be living. So even though your heart stops beating for a few minutes, your brain doesn't stop functioning.

While symptoms of multiple sclerosis can vary greatly from person to person, they usually begin within the first year of life. Symptoms may also be different for each individual, and often differ from one person to another. It is important to note that you cannot become dependent on your healthcare provider to provide you with information. Your only source for information should come from research studies conducted by an impartial third party (such as MS Society). Additionally, you do not need to seek professional treatment if you do not want to.


The National Multiple Sclerosis Society has established guidelines which will help you determine whether or not you could benefit from seeking out further medical attention. For example, we recommend that you ask a member of your family or a friend or colleague. You may also refer to information provided at www.multiplesclerosis.org/guidelines.aspx. If you decide to seek care, please keep in mind that MS experts are available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. There is always access to appropriate, unbiased medical information at MS Society's website at www.MSSociety.org.

Complete Answer: There is no direct causal link between immune stimulation and cancer cell development, but immune stimulation of cancer cells may induce tumor growth in patients with active disease or those who have an underlying immune deficiency.\nQuestion: How much does it cost for my insurance company to pay for MRI scans? Complete Answer: You should ask your insurer how much they charge per scan. Your insurance company will likely know which tests the MRI technician performs. Generally, you do not need any additional imaging other than what is required as part of the diagnosis process.

If you answered ""nothing"" to one or more of these questions, then there is probably some risk associated with your health that needs attention from your physician. This can include things such as infection, certain diseases, and even blood pressure problems. If a serious problem has been identified, or if it is apparent your health care provider cannot address it, you may want to consider getting a second opinion on how best to manage your health.","The risk of developing MS is considered very low in the general population at this time. There have been many studies that show no increased risk for MS among people who smoke or eat high amounts of processed meats. This includes eating fish with mercury, which has been linked to an increase in MS. It's also believed that alcohol intake may increase the chance of developing MS by as much as 30%. For more information on smoking, see our ""Smoking"" page. \nQuestion: How does exposure to asbestos play into my MS? Complete Answer: Asbestos is one of several toxins found in many types of products used during manufacturing processes including electrical equipment, industrial machinery, plastics and other materials used for construction. These chemicals can be inhaled through dusts from contaminated air, water sources, and surfaces where they may enter the lungs. Some workers exposed to these substances report symptoms such as coughing up blood and difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle aches, headaches, nausea, and vomiting; others report little to no illness. It was reported that the rate of pulmonary fibrosis (fibrosis) among workers involved with building projects in Vietnam resulted from the use of asbestos fibers during cement production. In addition to possible health risks for workers exposed to some toxic compounds, asbestos also has a tendency to migrate out of mines where it was mined. Exposure to asbestos can also cause cancer when the material damages the lining of the lung. In the past few years, researchers have started investigating whether a link between asbestos exposure and lung cancer exists. Some of those scientists believe there could possibly be a connection between asbestos exposure and lung cancer since asbestos itself can damage the lining of the lungs. For more information on asbestos, see our ""Asbestos"" page.","The answer is ""Yes"". According to the Mayo Clinic, MS is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. Symptoms include fatigue, numbness or pain in one hand or foot, difficulty speaking, problems with vision, hearing, thinking, balance, coordination and sensation in one side of the body, dizziness, trouble swallowing, difficulty breathing, facial nerve paralysis, difficulty walking, joint stiffness, weakness and abnormal movements (e.g., double whammy) on both sides of your body. MS can begin within weeks after exposure to environmental chemicals that cause damage to the immune systems of animals. If you have symptoms such as redness, swelling or loss of feeling on one side of your body or severe muscle twitching, it's important to contact your doctor immediately. This type of MS often comes on slowly over time and does not always respond to treatment. If symptoms worsen after 1 year of being treated, ask for help from your local MS center. You may be eligible for disability compensation if your condition continues to improve and you still need it.

In general, people between ages 50 to 70 who have had MS for at least 10 years show the greatest increases in risk. However, this risk increase varies greatly by individual. The most important factor that influences the risk of developing MS is whether or not you've had MS before. There is no specific ""best time"" when you should start therapy with an MS drug; however, as your condition improves, more severe symptoms will become less frequent. At some point during treatment with an MS drug, you may experience a relapse of MS symptoms. Even if this does occur, however, it's unlikely to be lasting enough to warrant further treatment. Your likelihood of having long-term (at least 3 months) or persistent (in at least 6 weeks) MS symptoms depends on many factors, including your current age, how much disease you already have, the severity of your illness, your family history of MS and other factors. A person's chance of going through a full course of MS medications increases with his/her age. For example, someone 65 years old has a 1 in 2 chance of getting an MS drug after taking one of these drugs within the past year, while a 20-year-old has only a 1 in 5 chance. The longer the disease goes untreated, the greater the chances are that patients will eventually go through a relapse. If you're considering starting new medication, make sure you know all of the potential risks and benefits. It's also best to get advice from your doctor and/or pharmacist about possible side effects. What is MS? MS affects up to 25% of people with the neurological condition. Most of the MS patients live with their condition without any significant problems. People who do experience serious symptoms can often manage them themselves with the help of medicines such as corticosteroids and anti-inflammatory medications. They'll continue to benefit from the medications they take until they stop taking them altogether.

What causes MS? MS occurs when a cell dies and then becomes cancerous. This results in lesions on the brain and spinal cord which eventually damage the nerves. These nerve cells normally do not die but instead form tumors known as neurofibromas. These tumors can move throughout the body, causing numbness, tingling, weakness, paralysis, loss of vision, and sometimes even death. You may notice signs and symptoms such as muscle pain, fatigue, joint aches, fever, and gastrointestinal issues among others. But there are two main types of","Your body is exposed to many different types of substances called ""radicals"" that may cause your immune system to attack itself. The more this occurs the higher the risk for developing MS. You should always talk with your doctor before taking any supplements or medications.\nQuestion: How do I get rid of my cat? Complete Answer: There are many natural remedies you can use on your pet to remove it from your home or yard without harming it. To remove cats simply trim the hair off their bodies by shaving it off. To make them look more like normal cats place some food in front of them so they eat and drink but don't actually eat anything else.

Meat (beef, pork, chicken, turkey or fish) - Try cutting down on meat consumption completely during periods of stress such as sickness or family emergency. A little bit of protein can help to reduce anxiety. \nQuestion: What do you recommend regarding thyroid conditions? Complete Answer:","The risk for developing MS is increased in people with certain genetic mutations of the T-cell receptor that cause immune rejection. However, there is no proof that taking certain medications or supplements will prevent the development of MS. It is generally thought that an excess of certain drugs can actually increase the risk.


QUESTION: What is an effective way to prevent the spread of Lyme disease? Complete Answer: There have been several studies showing that antibiotics don't work very well. Some research suggests that the best option is to use a tick repellent to protect yourself from ticks. Other options include applying oil on your skin, using a chemical spray containing DEET (also known as picaridin), or putting a mosquito net over you head. You can also wear insect repellant and use a bug catcher or bug spray to cover up your body when walking outside in areas where mosquitoes are prevalent. If you suspect that you may be bitten by a bitey bug (such as an African clawed beetle or blacklegged tick), contact your doctor or local public health department immediately at once.","A high incidence of MS is reported in patients with AIDS, diabetes mellitus, tuberculosis, hepatitis C, alcohol abuse, the use of cocaine or marijuana, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anorexia nervosa, thyroid disorders, ulcerative colitis, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, and infections.\n\nQuestion: What do you recommend? Complete Answer: I offer advice on nutrition, exercise, stress reduction techniques, and how to avoid many of the causes that can lead to disability and illness. We also discuss some of the medical problems related to being overweight. \nQuestion: Are there any risks associated with your work? Complete Answer: There have been no reports of serious injury due to my work. However, because I am so involved in this field, I am constantly exposed to different types of danger, both personal and workplace. There is always risk, however, because people who work in this profession suffer from a variety of mental illnesses, which often include mood disorder, anxiety, depression, self-destructiveness, alcoholism, drug addiction, and other factors. In addition, many people work under unhealthy conditions, including sleeping conditions, temperatures that cause dehydration, food preparation procedures that contribute to weight gain, physical inactivity, and the environment in which they live. Finally, as a result of these dangers, many people die each year from their injuries, even though they work safely and effectively. Unfortunately, it is impossible to eliminate all of the risk, but the best way to reduce your chances of developing a serious condition such as MS is to remain healthy. Please check out the information below for more information about specific ways to help reduce your risk.\n

About Me

I'm Peter F. Lachance. Since 1997 I've been writing medical articles, reviews, and education material regarding science, medicine, and medical care. For 15 years, I was Director of Research and Evaluation at the National Institutes of Health's Center for Biomedical Research Ethics. During those 16 years I assisted numerous scientists, clinicians, and government officials as they created programs and policies that led to improved patient outcomes and better quality of life in research studies. Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to travel to over 50 countries around the world to consult with scientists, physicians, and researchers from diverse backgrounds. While I've received awards from the American Society for Clinical Oncology, the International Council for Science, the National Academy of Medicine,","The risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases with age at onset of symptoms (early onset). For most people the disease starts with a fever, muscle aches, headache or neck pain, and changes in vision, hearing, and balance that last for several weeks before relapses. You can help reduce this risk by finding out as much as you can about your own risk factors so that you can better plan an appropriate treatment program. \nQuestions: What is multiple sclerosis? Complete Answer: Multiple sclerosis is a serious degenerative disorder that causes loss of muscle control over movement and joint movement. It is caused when damage occurs in one of the two main motor neurons that transmit signals from one part of your body to another. Symptoms include numbness in the hands or feet, weakness, stiffness, pain, blurred vision, problems with balance, memory loss, facial pain, and other physical signs. There are no vaccines available to prevent MS, but there are many preventive measures that may make it less likely. Your doctor might recommend: Getting regular physicals;

Taking pills every day to lower the level of inflammation in the joints, muscles, blood vessels, and brain;

Treating certain medications (such as beta blockers);

Changing diet to limit sugar intake;

Using anti-inflammatory medicines (aspirin or ibuprofen) or corticosteroids to treat pain or swelling;

Being more active; and

Maintaining good general health and avoiding alcohol use (including drinking coffee, tea, cocoa, beer, wine, and hard liquor). \nThe National Multiple Sclerosis Society provides information on their website: http://www.mrs.org/nms/.

Provide useful, complete, and scientifically-grounded answers to common consumer search queries about health.\nQuestion: long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis\nComplete Answer:","\N (1) In humans, there is no evidence that MS leads to long term disability or even death. The disease may be associated with an increase in mortality but not with increased risk of early deaths. (2) MS patients who develop a new clinical presentation of the disease during their lifetime are more likely than other individuals to have at least one serious illness later on in life. Therefore, the majority of people diagnosed with MS will remain healthy throughout their lifetimes. (3) There is no clear evidence that there are any long term side effects from MS treatment. Most people with MS experience few if any complications after having had their MS treatment. Some people say they feel better immediately after stopping all treatments except for a couple of weeks of anti-inflammatory medication which is very rarely necessary. However, this does not mean that it's a good idea to stop MS treatment. It may take months or years before you can fully recover from your MS treatment. Other problems such as low bone density and joint pain should also be considered when deciding whether to continue with therapy.\nQuestion: what is the current cost for treating MS? Complete Answer: The cost varies widely depending on how many hours are required for each appointment, how much time you spend with the doctor, and how much money you pay. For example, most insurance companies will cover some of the initial costs of an appointment to treat MS. If you don't have insurance, you'll have to find out which insurance company covers you, how much you'll need to pay, and what coverage there is. Be aware that it could take several months to determine your payment amount. You should ask the doctor for an estimate. Ask for an estimated total annual cost as well; this includes both expenses incurred while waiting to see a doctor and payments made by the insurer as part of a policy. Make sure you check your insurance plan prior to going to the doctor to make sure the deductibles and co-payments are covered too. When paying for your health care, do remember to read the fine print. Here's a list of typical charges: \N (a) Initial medical consultation \N - $150 \N (b) Physical exam \N - $90 \N (c) Lab tests \N - $10 \N (d) Biopsies \N - $20 \N (e) Imaging \N - $30 \N (f) Prescriptions \N - $5 \N (g) X Rays \N - $100 \N (h) Chemotherapy","You may be asked about the following: \1) what you know of this disease; \2) what you have personally experienced in your life; \3) what other people say they've had symptoms similar or more severe than yours (including adverse reactions); \4) how it is that you've experienced some symptom(s) after taking certain medications; and \5) what might cause these symptoms. All questions will be used by medical professionals to help determine if you're likely to experience symptoms from any specific drug, food, herbal supplement, etc. A typical question may include: \1) What does ""symptoms"" mean for you? What could you potentially experience? How do you expect these symptoms to affect your life? Do you feel that your overall health would improve with treatment? \2) Have you noticed anything unusual about your symptoms? Are there others who have suffered the same problems as you? Is there something else you can do if you haven't been able to find someone who's had similar problems? \3) Did you notice any improvement in your quality of life while you were treated for MS? If so, why? \4) Do you think your MS has progressed to the point where treatment is no longer effective? Could there be another reason? Can you imagine how much worse things could get if the person you love was diagnosed with MS? \5) What should you do now that you aren't on any medication? What would you like to keep doing instead of being treated with drugs that don't work? The goal of this questionnaire is to provide information that can help identify potential treatment options that might be beneficial to both you and your partner. Your answers will not be shared with anyone outside the clinical trial.

I just wonder what's going to happen to me one day.\nQuestion 1: What are your chances of getting MS at some time in the future? Given that you'll probably live only two years, let us consider four different scenarios, each involving your decision to take a particular medication. The first scenario, which assumes that you choose an aggressive regimen of medicine that leads to full recovery within six months, asks whether MS will be caused by the drug you take and how it may impact your quality of life during that period.

As with other diseases or conditions, the disease may not appear for many years after an exposure. If symptoms appear within one year of exposure, they must be considered as potential complications from the exposure. 2. Many cases have been reported in which an individual has developed symptoms only after prolonged exposures to low levels of a substance. In such cases, it is often difficult to determine whether there were actual long-term effects on the brain associated with this exposure. 3. Although some individuals who are exposed to chemicals used in agriculture have symptoms consistent with MS, the extent of these effects remains uncertain because many workers do not know that they have the condition. However, there is some evidence that increased incidences of MS among agricultural workers may result from occupational exposure.\n4. The chemical industry has made efforts to reduce the number of pesticides being used in agriculture, but even these reductions will probably increase the risk of developing MS, given the current rate of growth of the pesticide use market. While we cannot predict when or if MS will become more prevalent among the general population, the fact that MS is currently occurring in a small portion of the general population indicates that the incidence of MS may grow substantially over time. There is no known treatment or cure for MS; however, research studies are underway to develop new treatments or vaccines against MS.\n5. A study led by Drs. Gabor Mate and Yvonne Kastel of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) found that in mice injected with aluminum, MS appeared to progress rapidly. Aluminum was shown to cause oxidative stress in the nervous system of the animals.\n6. When looking at specific species, the data suggests that MS is most likely to occur in birds, mammals, reptiles and fish. \ n 7. As for the link between food allergy and MS, it should be noted that there does seem to be a relationship. For example, animal feeding experiments have shown that foods containing preservatives like thiamine or vitamin C tend to aggravate the allergic response. Also, studies conducted in Canada have shown a correlation between the presence of gluten and the development of MS in children born to mothers who had celiac disease or wheat allergy. Based upon recent findings in the literature, a possible connection between MS and gluten ingestion might exist.\n8. Some people report that their skin becomes very dry and red during times of high temperatures, especially in hot weather or extreme heat. Although it is known that this could be due to inflammation, there appears","I have no personal experience with MS but did research on the topic when it first came up in 1996. The primary thing that concerns me is the potential for relapse because this disease has such a short life span. I'm not sure what to do about it yet but you might want to consider consulting with an MD or a neurologist. If your question related specifically to blood pressure, see http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bloodpressure.htm. Question: How much does it cost to run a local drug store? \N\Answer: $20-$30 per day depending on the type of drug (if there's a discount, that would be great). Note, some pharmacies also offer discounted prices for prescription drugs. A typical order will include prescriptions for 100 tablets (10 mg), 50 tablets (5 mg) and 30 tablets (2.5 mg). You can call the pharmacy to find out if their discount applies to your particular situation. For example, my mother went to the same pharmacy as I did and was charged only $19.60 per month at the time she called. When my father arrived from his vacation he asked to pay by credit card instead so we could use our debit cards. He got to keep the savings, but we had to pay him an additional $15 for each $100 spent. There may be other drug stores where they'll charge less than half that.

Also watch for high fructose corn syrup or table sugar which cause bloating, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea and flatulence. Also watch for food additives like MSG, artificial colors, preservatives, and flavors. Some people also get ill after eating certain types of meat, dairy products, and fatty fish. It may take several weeks after an infection starts for symptoms to appear. The symptoms usually begin around the 20th week of illness. The main symptom is diarrhea - which becomes more severe with longer stays in hospital. This problem appears to improve over time. Most cases respond well to antibiotics. However, if the infected person isn't treated soon enough the condition will worsen. An antibiotic treatment alone won't cure the infection, though, so you must follow a","This question is not related to any other condition but it does require scientific information.\n

Short-Term Effects

Longer term effects of MS can be more severe, such as loss of motor skills and coordination, numbness or tingling in the arms and legs, trouble speaking, difficulty with swallowing, muscle weakness, blurred vision, cognitive impairment, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, increased risk for serious infections, and even death. These long term effects also include a greater chance that you will get cancer. For example, if you live in an area where the rate of MS is high enough to increase your risk of developing cancers, you may want to consider getting treatment early (for example, taking antibiotics after an infection).


It is important to recognize what you should do when these long-term effects occur. The most appropriate course of action depends on the severity and time elapsed between the onset of symptoms and your doctor's diagnosis of MS. You need to determine whether you might benefit from some form of therapy or disease prevention. If there is no effective treatment available, or if you would like to try alternative therapies, discuss these options with your physician. Your doctor can recommend complementary or alternative treatments based on their proven effectiveness, safety, and cost.

How Can I Treat Myself?

To help prevent further complications from MS, many people prefer to avoid surgery altogether. But there are a few options that can make a difference. There is currently no cure for MS but there are several ways to reduce symptoms over time and slow down the progression of the disease. Treatment may consist of medications, lifestyle changes, exercise, and sometimes rehabilitation programs. However, the best way to treat yourself is by learning all the techniques and tools available so that you can use them effectively to manage your MS symptoms better. To learn more about how to improve your MS care, visit this page on How to Improve Your Health Care Choices.","Although it is not known exactly what causes MS, the scientific consensus now holds that repetitive strain injury (RSI) plays an important role in causing the disease.\n\nOther symptoms of MS include fatigue, headaches, vision changes, muscle weakness, pain in joints and fingers, numbness in extremities, and loss of bone density and strength.\n

Cognitive Impairment and the Use of Treatment Options

Many people experience cognitive impairments after treatment for depression. Many people also experience cognitive impairment following treatment for chronic pain. However, cognitive impairment may interfere with your ability to obtain needed medication, so we have provided an article summarizing the current literature to help you make informed decisions regarding whether to use certain therapies.

The CDPH has received reports of two cases where individuals experienced cognitive impairment in response to taking antidepressant medication. In both cases, these individuals were treated as outpatients at academic medical centers. The initial assessment showed no significant impairment. Several weeks later, the patient experienced symptoms similar to those associated with major depressive disorder and developed clinically meaningful psychiatric manifestations during a period of approximately four months. These included anxiety, insomnia, irritability, panic attacks, paranoia, impulsivity, hostility, aggression, delusions, hallucinations, depression, sleep disturbances, loss of concentration, and poor judgment. These symptoms did not recur when discontinuing treatment. At this point, it appears the patient's cognitive impairment continued despite discontinuation of the antidepressant medication. This case demonstrates that cognitive impairment can result from adverse reactions to antidepressants. It is important to note that most antidepressant drugs are safe and effective for treating depressed mood, but other factors may play a role in causing cognitive impairment. The results of this case underscore the need to carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of antidepressant therapy before initiating treatment.

If you believe your memory or mental abilities are impaired by antidepressant usage, consult your doctor or mental health professional.","I have been asked this question by a number of users, and I am going to try to answer it in the most complete way possible. My view is that many people who believe they have MS will not get diagnosed with MS until they reach middle age. Many women with MS who think they may be at risk for getting MS also do not develop MS because they do not know or fear that their symptoms could indicate the development of MS. So I am not trying to say you can't develop MS if you don't live to adulthood (or even as late as 25). In fact, just the opposite is true - studies show that MS patients who live past 75 and never had symptoms before do sometimes experience early signs of MS. However, when those patients receive appropriate treatment, such as steroids or corticosteroids, the disease becomes less severe and more manageable. The same is true for some men with MS who did not develop any MS symptoms previously; however, the onset of clinical manifestations of the disease often occurs too late to prevent them from getting proper diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring.\nQuestion: should a person with MS ask her doctor for help?\nComplete Answer: Most doctors are good enough on their own, so there's no reason why you couldn't contact your primary care provider for information, advice, or support. If someone else does it better than you, great! But there's always a chance that he or she will make a mistake or misunderstand something. For example, maybe you'll be told that you need a doctor visit to determine if an MRI scan was done correctly. Or perhaps, the doctor has trouble understanding how you might feel. Again, talk to your doctor first and see what sort of things he or she might be able to help you with. \nQuestion: When searching online for information, is there a section devoted to people with MS?\nAnswer: Yes, there is. Here are two of my favorites. First is the article ""Where Can I Find Information About People Who Have Multiple Sclerosis?"" which includes resources for people with MS. Second is the one titled ""Who Has More Potential for Getting MS?"". It explains where you should look to find out whether someone has had recent symptoms, what they've seen, and what's been doing since, to help identify risk factors and potential treatments for MS. There is even a detailed list of possible types of multiple sclerosis, including rheumatoid, scleroderma, fibromyalgia, lupus, psoriatic arthritis, and thyroid"

It is also acceptable to provide this information online so you can read the response before responding. If your name is found on the company's personnel file for any reason other than your employment status as a physician, your name may be removed from the list of employees who have requested permission to use their names without restriction (or permission to correct a mistake). You will receive no notification if you do not want to share your name. The name of any employee whose job involves providing care to patients, such as home health aides or nurses, should always be disclosed, even though they are not entitled to use their own names under Federal law. The information we collect on behalf of the U.S. Department of Labor should only include basic demographic data such as address, gender, race/ethnicity, age, marital status, education, income and occupation; however, our records are not designed to identify individual workers by name. We do not ask for Social Security Numbers or any personal identifying information, except as required by law. Your responses should contain minimal detail and should be accurate, concise, well organized and clearly written. Please follow these simple guidelines when submitting your information: 1) Do not disclose personal information, including but not limited to social security numbers, driver's licenses, birth dates and addresses 2) Include a physical description of yourself, such as your height, weight, eye color, hair color, hair texture, skin tone, ethnicity, date of birth, position, organization(s), title and year of appointment 3) Give a clear indication of why you think you need assistance; the more detailed you make your request, the easier it will be to obtain support.

Appendix B: Information Disclosure Policy and Procedures The following policy applies to medical information provided by employers. The policy sets forth the requirements for reporting information about an employee to the U.S. Department of Labor and prescribes procedures for conducting a background check on such reports. For additional information and to review the policies applicable to you as a resident employer, please consult the regulations promulg","In my experience, I find it surprising how many people who have MS know nothing about it or are confused by the symptoms. They think that it is some kind of incurable disease and they don't understand why someone should be able to do anything about it. It's not, and often times they just aren't informed enough to make any educated decision. The best way to share information with others is through clear descriptions of what one does (what you do) on an everyday basis. If this doesn't happen in your job, consider taking part in an online survey for your company or organization. Some organizations are starting to provide such surveys; others prefer that employees volunteer their responses anonymously. When all else fails, send them the following personal statement that explains exactly what you did in the past year and what you do now. This will allow them to see more clearly than they can possibly imagine the impact your actions have on other people.\nQuestion: What would help me most if I were diagnosed with cancer? Complete Answer: As much as possible, take care of myself when I am sick. Get lots of rest. Exercise regularly. Take supplements. Use natural remedies whenever needed. Learn the meaning of vitamins (such as B12 and D3). And so forth. Keep working hard, even though you may feel sick sometimes.

If you have questions about health and your role within a workplace, contact an experienced attorney.","When your boss is the first to find out you have MS and has been advised by his/her physician that it's not treatable, he/she may see this as an opportunity to improve morale and productivity in the workplace and perhaps even to make some money. You should be prepared for this, but you should never go into full denial or denial of reality until it seems like the only option available. If you do, they'll leave you alone and continue trying their best to push you away. I don't believe that everyone who has MS goes through all this. Many people with MS do better than others. It is my contention that most people with MS can get on with life without much effort or expense. But if they wish to pursue professional or educational pursuits, they must take steps to protect themselves from relapse. The following two paragraphs are intended to help you understand what MS symptoms and signs look like, what causes them and how they cause one to lose hope and then to become overwhelmed with anxiety when new information becomes available. They also indicate the types of treatments that can help to reduce symptoms and lead to remission and recovery.\n\s

Symptoms of MS

At first glance, MS appears like little more than chronic fatigue, irritability and loss of interest in normal activities. But there are many other physical manifestations of MS, including: \pnumb\

\n\The above list includes just a few of the various symptoms that can present in a patient. There are many others. Some of these features include: \pnumb\

\n\Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can affect anyone, regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity or socioeconomic status; \pnumb\

\n\There is no single answer for why RA occurs in certain individuals and not others. In fact, according to the American College of Rheumatology, ""Different clinical presentations may reflect different underlying diseases."" However, most patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and to a lesser extent Crohn's disease, experience significant disability due to pain, stiffness, tiredness, cognitive impairment and emotional distress. While symptoms vary widely among RA patients, there are certain characteristics that appear to result in a greater likelihood of developing RA. These include: \pnumb\

\n\Many studies have shown that persons with rheumatoid arthritis tend to have higher serum levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation, than those without RA.\n

\n\Some","The first question should ask about the condition that is being discussed. However, you need not provide a comprehensive response to all possible questions. Also note that some people will be more sensitive than others when it comes to discussing their own specific conditions. For example, if someone has had MS for years, but doesn't have any symptoms right now, she may feel uncomfortable talking about her current condition or even mention other diseases related to MS. Ask about how everyone else feels regarding the subject of MS, and then do your best to answer the remaining questions appropriately. If you're unsure how to respond to these kinds of inquiries, see our FAQ on How To Respond to Common Consumer Searches.

4. Do I Have to Get A Referral Letter?

Most employers require the request for referral letter before an employee can begin working without an appointment. However, some employees (particularly those who already have some training) often qualify for no-obligation referrals.

If you want to use a no-obligation referral, you'll still need to discuss with your employer what kind of recommendation they might give you, but this doesn't necessarily mean that you must agree to participate in a program like the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's Web site. It also doesn't mean that your job won't suffer because you refuse to help out in the form of free research materials.

5. Can My Employer Offer Me An Appointment Without Having My Involvement In It?

Some organizations, including the U.S. Department of Defense and federal agencies, allow for a nonparticipating employee to arrange for his or her own appointments with potential new hires. You might want to consider offering yourself as part of this arrangement, but remember that you don't have to sign a contract or anything like that.

6. What Is The Right Way To Tell Someone Who Has Multiple Sclerosis About Your Condition?

Some people seem baffled by the question of whether it's appropriate to ask a friend or family member about MS -- or perhaps even why we would ask them. While many are genuinely surprised, there are two main reasons for asking this question:

First, most people with MS believe that friends and relatives who have the disease are likely to tell you about it, regardless of whether they know you personally. This can be especially true of people with whom you share a family history, such as parents or siblings. Since you never knew your parents or brother-in-law, and were unaware of anyone in particular with MS","It is unlikely that you will be able to communicate your condition to all coworkers; however, there may be an opportunity for communication of information within the company through other means, such as e-mail or telephone call. In addition, it is advisable to ensure that you inform all employees of any potential adverse events related to MS, including symptoms of fatigue (fatigue), pain, dizziness, loss of coordination, and/or changes in cognition and mental status. If you have recently been diagnosed with MS, contact your physician if you believe this might affect your ability to perform your job satisfactorily. When in doubt, discuss it with your supervisor. Question: Should I wear my glasses while working? \nAnswer: All Americans should be required to wear them whenever they enter and leave buildings or facilities. However, it is not necessary to wear corrective lenses during daily activities when you are performing routine tasks, such as loading and unloading vehicles. This applies to both workers who operate heavy equipment and those who carry heavy loads on their shoulders. You are also allowed to use eyeglasses in certain situations under special circumstances that require them. For example, you can do so while operating heavy machinery and driving motorcycles. To protect yourself from damage caused by debris, dust, airborne particles, heat, rain, high winds, and even static electricity, it is recommended that you wear a safety vest, protective clothing, eye protection, and gloves and appropriate footwear. The wearing of the proper earplugs is strongly encouraged. Questions: What types of materials make up a computer monitor? Does your employer use monitors manufactured by Sharp, Dell, Gateway, HP, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Seiko, Panasonic, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, Philips, NEC, Intuos, Sanyo, and others? Complete Answer: Your employer uses either screens made from LCD monitors or displays. Each type offers advantages and disadvantages depending upon its characteristics and application. They include: LCD Screens: These screens usually provide excellent color reproduction and contrast.

Pros: Wide viewing angles and viewing distance increase efficiency of images displayed on these panels.

Cons: Low resolution, low brightness, poor contrast and color accuracy.

LED Screens: LED screens offer great colors, high dynamic range, wide viewing angle, good pixel density, and low persistence of vision.

Pros: High resolution and contrast, excellent color reproduction and contrast, large viewing angles, good pixel density, very low persistence of vision, no flicker.

Cons: Poor color","This is an issue that has been discussed on the Medical Internet Message Board, and I think it would be wise for you to post this information as well. There appears to be no specific laws or regulations to address this matter. However, if your employer does not want their employees posting in this forum (or anything else), they can send a letter to me outlining the reasons why. You may also contact the Health Information Technology Task Force (HITF) at www.health.gov/hits/index.html, and the National Academy of Sciences' Task Force on Biomedical Informatics and Information Management (www.nationalacademies.org/biomedinfo/tasks/bmiip).

The answer should be posted to our Web site so everyone who wants to know more can get the answers they need without having to bother with sending off letters to their employers. My web page contains detailed explanations of everything from what the terms mean to whether MS is considered a disease or a disorder. For example, there's some confusion regarding the term ""disorder"" -- one person says ""no,"" while another calls it a ""disease."" I've also included links to other sites where people have discussed various topics related to MS with other individuals and organizations. \nQuestion: Why isn't my doctor making recommendations about taking medication? Complete Answer: Your doctor may offer recommendations about which medicines to take, but he'll often tell you that the benefits outweigh the risks. The American Academy of Neurology recommends against certain drugs. I'm sure you all read that article about MS and wondered what drugs would work best in treating it. That article was written by Dr. David A. Miller of the University of California at San Francisco, and it suggests that many medications don't even work at all for MS. He concludes that ""there is little research available to support the use of any drug for MS."" It's important to note that this recommendation doesn't apply only to pharmaceuticals. If you already take any drug, you could go ahead and take another without fear of damaging your condition. But we're dealing here with general guidelines that doctors use when prescribing new treatments.\nQuestion: Do I need to see a specialist before getting help with MS? Complete Answer: Although not all patients will benefit from seeing a neurologist or psychiatrist, there are a few things you may do just to make sure you don't end up with a debilitating MS. First, talk to friends and family members. Ask them questions like, What if I","Your response can help your employer understand the importance of disclosure to their workforce.\nQuestion: How do I know if my employer is giving me an equal opportunity for employment? Is it true that employers often give preference to women over men when making hiring decisions? Are they also required to provide them with all the benefits offered by their company? Complete Answer: The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has established clear guidelines on who should be eligible for employment based on sexual orientation. For example, a male employee in the U.S. is considered gay/lesbian only if he or she was sexually attracted to someone of the same sex or ""same gender."" However, employers may consider applicants' ability to perform a variety of jobs within the company without regard to sexual orientation as a factor in determining which candidates will receive consideration. A company's decision about whether or not to employ an applicant based on sexual orientation does not automatically bar the application from being considered by other companies seeking to hire employees. Employees who wish to make discrimination claims against their employers must first file a charge with the EEOC within three years of the date of the discrimination. When you have filed your charge, the EEOC will investigate it to determine whether there is enough evidence to prove a violation of federal law. This investigation typically involves an interview with both the complainant and respondent, with the complaint then going through several stages of review before finally reaching an official determination. If the agency finds reasonable cause, the agency will refer the case to the Department of Justice, and an enforcement action could result. Please note that some states require an employer to offer free sexual reassignment surgery to employees who want one after receiving a letter stating their need for such treatment. Although this requirement does not prohibit discrimination, it prevents the employee from getting medical care that they might otherwise get because they don't have insurance coverage for it. Federal law requires employers to let employees who are transgender change their name and gender marker on all documents, including birth certificates, passports, and driver licenses. In addition, employers may refuse to allow any person to use restrooms that correspond to the gender on their legal identification. Allowing a man to enter a woman's bathroom would violate Title IX, but denying a woman access to the ladies room would also likely violate Title VII. Finally, although a single individual's decision regarding his or her own gender identity may be best left to that individual alone, an organization's nondiscrimination policies should reflect the diversity of its membership, regardless of gender identity. For more information about the rules governing restroom access,","They may not be aware of my disability, but they can easily infer that I have MS when I'm in the office or on the phone. In addition, I am often asked by clients if it's possible for me to attend an appointment with their physician without feeling sick (even though I'm covered under the ADA). This is because some physicians believe that MS might require medications or other treatments. As long as no one has any reason to suspect that I'm going to take any medication, I cannot complain. When I'm out of the office, doctors sometimes ask ""Do you feel ill?"" But I just tell them that I don't know and move on to another topic.\nQuestion: should I disclose that I have chronic pain while visiting patients?\nAnswer: If I see patients who are experiencing pain, I am able to give information about what is causing it; however, because most people think of MS as a physical condition, they would assume that I must use all of my senses to assess the severity of pain. To avoid such confusion, I usually don't report that I suffer from MS. However, if I do visit someone who suffers from MS, I can provide information about pain. For example, I could write down the specific symptoms of the person's pain, and then explain why this pain level is so difficult to manage. The only exception to this rule is when I receive a diagnosis of depression. In this case, I would report the details of how much time I spend with the patient during each visit, along with any problems I encounter. If a doctor thinks I've made too many visits to that individual to count, he/she is more likely to order additional tests that may reveal that I'm suffering from MS. I also recommend that when working at home, when I arrive at my desk, I immediately walk through the door. This helps keep the conversation away from my computer screen, and allows me to maintain eye contact. At the same time, it prevents anyone from thinking that I have been sitting there for hours. \nQuestion: where is my MS label printed?\nAnswer: It is usually on the back of your prescription bottle, so I won't need to print it in the bathroom. However, if I go to the pharmacy to purchase pills, it is important that I return the pill container to the pharmacist before leaving. This way, if I ever get lost, I'll know exactly where my medicine is. After taking my first prescription of treatment, I kept looking in every corner of","In this scenario, the disclosure of MS in the workplace would be viewed negatively by coworkers for two main reasons. First, as discussed above, a significant portion of their job is doing research and therefore may have some exposure to MS patients. Second, they might perceive that you personally have or had a family member with MS. They could even consider your employer's decision to fire you. This could lead them to believe that you intentionally concealed or delayed information on MS from them. For these reasons, employees who disclose MS often experience negative reactions from their co-workers, particularly if the employee has been diagnosed with MS himself.

Affects: Information disclosed to an individual employee could cause harm if other people learn that the person has or had MS. These adverse effects include the following:\1\ - Unwarranted fear of retaliation by the employer;\2\ - Fear of loss of employment, reduced earnings, and lost benefits;\3\ - Loss of self esteem;\4\ - Increased risk of harassment and discrimination;\5\ - Decreased productivity because of increased anxiety and depression due to not being able to do certain activities as well as diminished motivation to achieve results;\6\ - Reduced quality of life due to decreased ability to perform the duties needed in the industry;\7\ - Increase in health insurance premiums due to increased costs;\8\ - Reduction of job satisfaction, increased turnover rates, and potential decreases in pay and promotions;\9\ - Disruption of relationships with family members and friends due to stigma associated with MS; and\10\ - Increased costs to society due to increased insurance claims and related costs due to denial of care, hospitalizations, prescriptions, and medication. Some cases may also result in lawsuits, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. To avoid all of the adverse effects outlined above, it is recommended that the employer make a good faith effort to help employees understand the disease. The goal should be to foster a positive relationship between the employee and his/her supervisor. When employees know MS, they feel much more comfortable disclosing any issues regarding MS that might arise. In addition, employers need to seek out support networks (e.g., health clubs, local physician groups) and social services agencies such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Samaritans to address these types of needs. Employers should create policies and procedures to allow an employee with MS to discuss problems without fear of retribution and to identify appropriate treatment options.

Question: What is the most effective way to tell a patient about their","The answer is simple. They will not find it believable that an employee with MS could be working at a multinational corporation. Therefore, there may be some resistance on the part of the managers to this information. However, they have to acknowledge the fact that MS can occur in employees even when they do not present symptoms or signs. This is because most people with MS have abnormal levels of white blood cells (e.g., CD4) which makes them vulnerable to infection by harmful bacteria such as MRSA. Furthermore, MS patients experience chronic pain and debilitating fatigue due to their disability. In addition, people with MS face other important health challenges, such as being exposed to various toxins while working at high temperatures. These activities have caused some people to develop the condition. It is therefore imperative for management to address these issues. To help reduce this risk, we recommend that companies make sure that all employees with MS receive accurate information regarding the disease and take appropriate precautions against exposure to harmful substances. \nQuestion: should I ask my manager if he/she knows someone who has MS? Answer: Yes, the question should be asked. It is recommended that you discuss whether any person with MS has ever worked at your company, and then give him/her an opportunity to describe what it's like to be part of the company culture. It is also recommended that you seek out experts to speak with. For example, a professional nurse from a local hospital would be a great resource for someone with MS. Also, consider consulting with a doctor who specializes in treating MS; however, you should not rely solely upon the advice of doctors. A professional physician might not be available. Finally, it is important that you remember that MS affects only a small percentage of the population. You should never assume that any individual you meet is suffering from MS. All individuals with MS have different symptoms, experiences, and abilities.

Unfortunately, many employers take advantage of these programs by requiring employees to purchase expensive products, like cars, while working in their facilities. Employers also often fail to reimburse injured workers for lost wages. A recent survey found that only 7% of employers had paid out benefits for car repairs performed by their own employees. By discouraging the hiring of individuals with preexisting conditions, personal responsibility could lead to high costs and poor outcomes for those who are injured by others. \r

Questions About How Long Does Chronic Pain Last? A Short Summary

Q: What is chronic pain?

A: Many people believe chronic pain is something specific to one's body and/or a certain type of injury. In reality, many people feel both general and specific pain.

There are two main kinds of pain: non-specific and specific. Non-specific pain occurs during physical activities where there is little difficulty. Specific pain occurs when there is difficulty performing repetitive tasks, such as walking or lifting heavy objects. Sometimes non-specific pain is associated with nerve damage, while other times, it can occur independently.

Non-specific pain is typically temporary, lasting less than 6 weeks, whereas specific pain can last longer than 2 years, usually due to permanent structural damage, muscle atrophy, joint injuries, or cancer. Some cases of chronic","No. Multiple sclerosis affects only 1 percent of the general population. In many cases, symptoms disappear with treatment, usually within 4-12 months. A person can have both MS and an autoimmune disease at the same time. The disease is often treated by the same doctor (who prescribes steroids or corticosteroids) but in some people, there may be a coexisting condition that affects their neurology (such as epilepsy).\nQuestion: How do I keep from falling asleep while driving or operating heavy machinery?\nAnswer: Read your directions carefully. Most accidents happen because you didn't read them properly. You should take extra care when making turns, especially if you drive on a highway. Make sure you have adequate space between yourself and other vehicles and pedestrians on the road. Also remember that motorized traffic is dangerous for everyone involved; it's important not to get distracted while behind the wheel. If your eyes start blinking too fast after several minutes, use your phone as a guide and slow down to a safe speed. Some children will experience this problem, but they can prevent it using safety seatbelts. See also: The Complete Health Care Guide

What are some common misconceptions about eating meat? \nThis question has been asked many times during our many years as a group of vegetarian, vegan, and omnivorous people. We've answered these questions before.\nQuestion: What does eating animal flesh taste like?\nAnswer: It tastes like fresh blood. Animal flesh contains protein, fat, calcium, iron, and vitamins B1, B2, C, D, E, K, zinc, copper, molybdenum, manganese, nickel, aluminum, potassium, sodium, and zinc. Other things that are found in animal flesh include mercury, lead, and arsenic. Animals must eat grasses, which contain vitamin A and are rich in minerals such as phosphorus, magnesium, selenium, chromium, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, folate, manganese, iodine, zinc, iron, manganous oxide, copper, and molybdenum.\nQuestion: How does eating animal flesh harm animals? How do I avoid causing harm to others?\nAnswer: Eat only clean animal products whenever possible. Avoid consuming meat, poultry, eggs, dairy, honey, shellfish, fish, and shellfish products that come from factory farms, including oysters, clams","Yes. Multiple sclerosis affects everyone differently and at different rates, but the rate is increasing for women (and men) in America. This includes people with MS who have not yet had their first attack. The effects of MS on your ability to work vary greatly from person to person. While many of us don't know it immediately, each new episode can cause serious problems such as memory loss, paralysis, muscle weakness or joint stiffness, and, in severe cases, even death. What you do will likely determine how well your MS will progress over time. You may also learn that some aspects of MS are treatable, which means they can be managed more effectively than others. If you have questions about the severity or nature of any symptoms, ask your doctor or pharmacist what they think should be done next. Most doctors have guidelines and treatments they recommend based on clinical experience. It's important to talk with your doctor before trying these treatments because you may want to consider them if you decide to change your prescription or use a different drug regimen. For example, if you're taking an anti-inflammatory medicine, some researchers believe it might make sense to try taking anti-inflammatory medication along with your antidepressant. Some other research shows that combining several medications in the same pill may help control symptoms of MS better. How Does Multiple Sclerosis Affect Your Life?\nAnswer: Many individuals with MS develop additional disabilities after having their first attack. These disabilities include numbness, tingling, or sensitivity to touch and temperature. In addition, there are those who feel like a part of themselves has been taken away. You could find yourself feeling disconnected from others, experiencing depression, or even just wanting to go home, but these feelings often go away when you start seeing a real person who understands the condition, especially if the person helps you through treatment. Are There New Therapies Available That Can Help Me With My Symptoms?\nCorrect Answers: No. A number of current therapies have been shown to increase symptoms, including psychotherapy, acupuncture, and nutritional changes. However, these therapies are still considered experimental and not widely used by most physicians.\nQuestion: I was diagnosed recently with multiple sclerosis. Since then I've received no responses to any of my emails. Why are your website searches going down? Complete Answer: We rely heavily on public-health systems, social media, and webinars for our information. Our services come only from reputable providers. Although we strive to keep your personal data safe, we cannot guarantee that your personally identifiable information will never leave","There is no evidence that MS affects the ability of an individual to work or perform other aspects of their life. However, people with MS have experienced difficulty in performing basic tasks such as driving a car or working in retail stores. A recent study showed that 70% of adults with MS were not able to get up from a seated position within 24 hours after getting off a bed without help.\n\nQuestion: How do I find a doctor who can treat me for cancer?\nAnswer: For many years there was no way to obtain information on which doctors provided the most effective treatment for cancer patients. Now, physicians across the country can be found through a free website called CureCancer.org. This site provides physicians' names, addresses and phone numbers. If you wish, you may also contact them directly by telephone at 800-632-4227. You should mention the word ""cancer"" when calling. Some may charge additional fees for their services.\n

\n","Yes. The risk of MS is higher in people who have had previous relapses or MS, which can lead to complications such as disability or even death. However, no serious permanent damage occurs from MS, and MS often goes away on its own without treatment. In addition, the disease's effects are generally temporary; the onset does not occur until several years after symptoms begin (and sometimes before any signs or symptoms present). So long as you do not have active MS, your chances for a prolonged or chronic course are low. Although some people with MS recover completely or may have some improvements after their first relapse, these are rare. If you develop MS again, you should seek professional care. Treatment for recurrent MS is similar to that of primary MS except that treatment usually involves medications and lifestyle changes rather than surgery. It is best if you first visit your doctor at least two months prior to starting any new medication. Many other illnesses cause similar problems to MS: for example, cancer, asthma, diabetes, arthritis, heart disease, sleep disorders, migraine headaches, and many others. Some of these conditions also appear to be associated with increased odds of MS, but they are not directly related to the condition itself. As an additional precaution, it is important to ask if there is another condition that might be causing your symptoms that may also increase your risk. This will help ensure that you receive the appropriate medical attention if your physician determines you need one.

In summary, MS appears to be relatively benign, especially compared to most of the other diseases, so long as you don't have current MS. While this information should provide relief to those suffering from MS, it certainly doesn't change the fact that we all suffer from other illnesses and conditions. And as always, you must take your own actions to ensure good health.","There is no definitive answer for this question as the causes of MS remain mysterious. The National Institutes of Health estimates that 30% of adults with MS will develop MS within 10 years of the first symptoms and 50% within 20 years. However, the exact cause remains unknown. Many scientists believe MS may be related to a genetic defect or an environmental factor such as pesticides, toxic metals, heavy metal exposure, excessive sugar intake or alcohol abuse, but there is currently no cure or effective treatment for the disease. In addition to MS, MS also affects several other types of diseases and conditions. The most common reason people find their careers affected by MS is stress. Because many people have a history of depression, anxiety, and/or insomnia, they have a higher risk of developing MS than people without these disorders. As a result, those who do experience these symptoms often seek help from physicians. A number of studies found that patients with MS were more likely to obtain professional licenses when their chronic illnesses had been treated successfully before, and more likely to retain their jobs after a positive diagnosis. For example, one study reported that patients with MS were significantly less likely to lose their job if they had a prior diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) (10). Another study examined whether employers would offer a disability benefit for MS and found that employers' willingness increased substantially in response to the presence of MDD and the presence of significant pre-existing illness. According to this study, only 2 percent of companies offered benefits based on MS symptoms; the prevalence was much lower for women with MDD and men with diabetes (11). Other research has shown that MS patients are less motivated to become employees, even after they receive full compensation, because they perceive it as an unnecessary hardship (12). Some experts argue that workers should not expect a high level of motivation just because of a condition like MS. While some researchers have suggested that negative feelings may deter individuals from seeking out information about issues surrounding MS, others have argued that these feelings often serve as barriers to better understanding. For example, some feel that the stigma associated with MS impairs their ability to share their experiences and provides an inadequate basis for evaluating potential candidates. Although there are different opinions regarding what causes MS, one thing is clear: People who have MS face considerable challenges in finding employment despite having excellent educational credentials and extensive work experience. When you consider how difficult it can be for individuals with MS to gain access to information on the topic, you might wonder why there are so few articles on the subject available online. This article will outline","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) can be a serious disability that causes you significant pain and has some of the most severe symptoms of any neurological condition. However, it is possible for MS to progress even with effective treatment. As part of your job duties, you will provide information on this disease at various stages of its progression. In addition, you will research scientific research related to MS, provide guidance regarding the appropriate use of medications, and help others understand the importance of accurate screening tests. If you have received additional training in treating MS over the past two years, please note that we highly recommend that you have additional training in this area as well. Question: What does 'dementia' mean? Complete Answer: Dementia is an umbrella term used to describe a variety of conditions including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and dementia praecox. Question: How can I determine if there are other patients like me who are experiencing the same problem? Complete Answer: Our system allows us to recognize different diagnoses, so by reviewing our patient records and making a connection between them, we may discover that there might be many people suffering from similar problems or with similar symptoms. For example, we might find that one person was diagnosed with ""cognitive impairment"" but another suffered from ""anxiety."" We would then refer both to a doctor for evaluation, along with their family members. This also makes it easier for caregivers to stay informed of all patients undergoing care and to make sure they receive the necessary support.

Medical Information:

About Diabetes:

Diabetes is defined as having impaired control over blood sugar levels which are caused by abnormal blood vessel growth and contraction. In most cases, the cause is unknown. However, there may be genetic factors in some cases, such as hereditary hyperglycemia, and environmental factors, such as exposure to certain foods, alcohol or exercise.

About Insulin Resistance:

Insulin resistance occurs when body fat stores increase because of insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. This results in excess production of glucose from stored glycogen. As a result, blood glucose will rise slowly when blood sugars are lower than normal or when insulin sensitivity is high, resulting in hypoglycemia. In addition, low levels of circulating insulin produce abnormal liver enzymes that reduce glucose absorption into the bloodstream. When these conditions occur together, they may lead to severe hypoglycemic episodes (hypoglycemia), a sudden drop in blood glucose level resulting in shock, coma and death.

What Causes Insulin Deficiency Symptoms?

The main causes of insulin deficiency symptoms include obesity, poor glycemic control, malnutrition, and genetics. Obesity has been shown to contribute to insulin resistance. Low energy intake combined with increased food consumption are known risk factors contributing to insulin resistance. Other possible factors include genetic predisposition, diet (especially refined carbohydrates) and lifestyle issues.

How Can I Prevent or Treat Insulin Deficiency Symptoms?

A diet rich in complex carbohydrate foods may help prevent or treat insulin resistance, particularly if it includes added fiber. A balanced diet containing adequate protein and healthy fats can aid in weight loss and improved metabolic profile. Patients who suffer from hypoglycemia due to lack of insulin often experience other problems including muscle weakness and sleep disturbance. These patients need assistance"

Its prevalence varies widely between individuals; in general, people aged 50 years or older account for approximately 60% of all cases. However, certain subtypes have been associated with higher incidence rates; for example, an estimated 1 million Americans with multiple sclerosis suffer from multiple myeloma (a cancer of bone marrow) and an estimated 2 million adults have relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The causes of MS remain unknown, but it has been suggested that immune system overstimulation contributes to its severity, which may be due to a combination of genetics and environmental factors.\r

In addition, MS can affect people who do not exhibit signs and symptoms, such as those without a family history of MS or who had no previous illnesses prior to the onset of the illness. In fact, the exact reason why some people develop the debilitating disease after having normal brain function remains unclear.\r

There are several types of MS; however, the most commonly diagnosed is MS, which affects both males and females equally. People with MS typically report headaches, dizziness, stiffness, fatigue, depression, nausea, vision changes, loss of balance, difficulty speaking, muscle weakness, numbness, tingling sensations, pain, and swelling. Other reported physical effects include difficulty swallowing and/or chewing, sensitivity to light, color, texture, taste, smell, and touch, hearing disorders, and difficulty seeing or focusing. Some people also experience memory problems, confusion, irritability, anxiety, hallucinations, insomnia, and paranoia. Some of these symptoms go away on their own, but others appear worse if left untreated.\r

MS is generally treated successfully with medications that improve overall functioning, reduce disability, decrease disability progression, and prevent recurrence. Because of the limited evidence base, however, specific treatments are not recommended and are only indicated by specific clinical tests. For example, immunotherapy is used to treat active MS patients with antibodies against two viruses involved in the development of the disease. The drugs stimulate the body's production of a type of antibody called cytotoxic T cells to destroy the infection. Cytotoxicity is often difficult to demonstrate with standard clinical trials because the test must be repeated twice during treatment before a statistically significant difference occurs. In contrast, many new anti-cancer therapies are being developed with the goal of reducing the tumor growth rate in animals. This approach aims to increase the survival time of patients following initial treatments to less than 10 months, at which point","http://www.answers.com/topic/multiple-sclerosis \/

The following is an example of common questions answered with the help of a simple, easy to understand website. It was created by Chris Krantz, founder/owner of www.mrsmilesmiles.com and has been featured on Lifehacker before. The site contains over 100 pages of information related to MS and can be found at mrms.com.

Q: I have recently undergone surgery for an injury that occurred while lifting weights. Will I experience any long term side effects?

A: You will likely have a period of time where you feel like you need to take some breaks from training. Your body may not accept this as normal. This can last up to three months. During these times, it's important to try to focus on what you're doing. Don't let yourself think too much about the pain or lack of progress. Even after several weeks or months, you should still continue to exercise because it helps keep your muscles strong so they can move more effectively.

Q: Do you know if there are medications that can help reduce my symptoms or slow down their progression?

A: There aren't many medications available for treating MS. Some people find that","A: There is no cure or treatment for MS, but there are many treatments available for people who have the disease. Some of these treatments include physical therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), exercise, medication, lifestyle changes, and/or support from loved ones. The most effective treatment may be found by consulting with your family physician. In some instances, one option may not work well for everyone. In other instances, the best approach may vary depending on the individual's needs and personal preferences. For more information see ""MS Symptoms in Adults."" \nQuestion: What is the average length of time it takes to recover?\nAnswer: Average recovery time varies widely depending upon the type of stroke and how severe the injury was. For example, if you had a moderate to major stroke, recovery can take as little as 4 months, while a traumatic brain injury that causes damage to large parts of the brain can cause loss of memory, vision, speech, motor coordination, and balance within months. Recovery may also differ based upon the number of strokes received over the course of a lifetime. For instance, those who receive more than four strokes over their lifetimes will experience slower healing times than those who receive less than two strokes. This applies whether the stroke happened before age 35 years old, at age 65 years old, or age 85 years old.\nQuestion: How often does my brain get damaged during a stroke?\nAnswer: A person gets damaged by a stroke when blood flows into the brain causing damage to one or more of its cells. Most strokes occur because of head trauma, such as being knocked unconscious and falling down. Head injuries can also occur through falls, accidents, falls caused by drugs or alcohol, and other types of trauma that result in head trauma. These types of head injuries do not usually require hospitalization. If any of these types of brain injury occurs, doctors recommend immediate surgery to repair the damage. However, some patients may need longer recovery time.

All MS sufferers have at least one or more of the following symptoms: fatigue, headaches, muscle weakness, joint pain, dizziness, vomiting, blurred vision, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, insomnia, and visual disturbances (including double vision).\nB. MS is usually diagnosed after a detailed history including physical exam results, neurologic examination findings, lab test results, imaging tests, blood tests, chest X ray, abdominal ultrasound, MRI, etc. For patients with mild to moderate MS symptoms, you should provide general information about the symptoms as well as your own clinical experience in managing this disease. The list below shows specific questions that can be asked for each of these conditions. Be sure to answer all of the questions in order. You may want to refer to the following FAQs regarding MS:

What is Multiple Sclerosis?\nAnswer:

MS is a chronic inflammatory neurological disorder that affects 1% to 3% of people. It occurs when the immune system attacks and damages nerve fibers known as axons or dendrites in nerve cells. This damage causes changes in movement that result in paralysis of an affected limb. Symptoms vary widely among individuals and include difficulty walking, difficulty swallowing, trouble speaking, numbness and tingling in certain parts of the body, and problems with memory, language, balance, coordination, sensory perception, and judgment. A new patient may present with severe pain, fever, and a limp; the same patient may present in 2 weeks with no problem but have a swollen leg or a severe headache. Patients often suffer from cognitive impairment which often makes everyday tasks difficult. Many people report their symptoms improve over time. Some recover fully, some do not. In contrast to many other diseases, MS has been successfully treated by conventional treatment methods. MS is generally curable if treatment begins within 2 years after diagnosis. If left untreated, it will continue to progress until death. With appropriate treatment, the vast majority of persons who become ill with MS remain symptom free.\nQuestions: How long does it take to get better?\nAnswer:

There are two ways to respond to this question, and both options require significant effort. First, follow up with a physician experienced in treating MS. He/she might recommend surgery, immunosuppressive drugs such as steroids, and/or radiation therapy to help control the disease's progression. Second, you may consider seeking out treatment through a specialist like a neurologist or neurosurgeon. These professionals typically offer comprehensive care including","\http://www.samsclub.org/courses/ms/

The body needs more CSF from the lungs. This causes swelling in the brain and other symptoms of the disease. The amount of CSF available depends on how much CSF is circulating in the body. \nTotal blood volume \nIn an average adult: 8 ounces per minute. A woman's total blood volume is about 2 1/2 quarts. \nThe number of CSF cells that can be produced by each cubic millimeter of CSF varies widely between different people and diseases. The range for normal adults ranges from 50,000 to 100 million. The range for children ranges from 15,000 to 40 million. \nChildren also have different amounts of the proteins needed for proper functioning. Children need fewer proteins than adults. For example, infants require only 4 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. Adults need more protein than children because their bodies don't make enough of it. In fact, children typically need less protein than adults because their muscles do most of the work. When a child has an illness, her immune system releases antibodies designed to destroy tumors but often they don't respond well to vaccines or drugs that could help them fight cancer. Some children who get cancer develop severe side effects, like brain inflammation, seizures, paralysis, heart problems, or death. If you have questions about your child's immunization status, call your pediatrician at 612-624-4847. \nWhat is thimerosal?

\nThimerosal was removed from many childhood vaccines starting in 1999. Thimerosal has been linked to autism and neurological damage in fetuses and young children. It is used as an additive to prevent bacterial growth and in some medications. It can enter through food and drink. It may cause harm when swallowed, absorbed through the skin, or injected into tissues where it interacts with substances such as hormones and enzymes. Although there were no reports of adverse events after childhood vaccines containing thimerosal, CDC recommends that parents discuss this option with their doctor before vaccinating their children. \nIs it safe to give vaccines to my child?

\nHealthy kids should be vaccinated against all infectious diseases including flu. You should talk with your doctor if you want to choose another method of preventing illness in your family. Vaccines are one of many ways that we protect ourselves and our families from disease."
72,"You are a helpful medical knowledge assistant. Provide useful, complete, and scientifically-grounded answers to common consumer search queries about health.\nQuestion: Is the Covid-19 vaccine safe for people taking multiple sclerosis drugs?\nComplete Answer:","Yes, the vaccine is very safe when used according to directions. It can also be effective if given before the onset of symptoms or at the time of a major change in your disease course. However, it must not be administered after you have had an MRI scan (as this may result in increased side effects).\nQuestion: Are there any other vaccines that can cause more serious adverse reactions than these two? For example, what about MMR?\nAnswer: There are no known direct links between MMR vaccine and autism. In fact, it has been proven that MMR does not cause brain damage in adults who receive doses >4 times/y as recommended by the CDC. \nQuestion: What type of information should I include on my vaccine application form, which will help me make informed decisions about vaccinations? Complete Answer: You need to know: -the full name of the parent/guardian (who needs to sign) -date of birth of each child you plan to vaccinate -number and age of children involved in your vaccination plans -name and address of all vaccine providers -address(es) of doctors or clinics where you are going to get vaccinated -your medical history, including allergies, previous treatments, immunization histories, and treatment with other vaccines -vaccines in your list of top three choices; whether they were given in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood, and if so how often. The doctor's office/clinic and date of your appointment will tell you more specific information. Do NOT fill out the form without consulting an expert!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","The use of this vaccine is not recommended because of the risk of severe side effects from corticosteroids in high doses or long periods of time after vaccination. The Covid-19 vaccine was introduced into the U.S. market as an alternative to other vaccines that could cause serious adverse reactions such as fever, headache, or skin rash (fever caused by inflammation of the body's immune system). Some older clinical studies have reported serious allergic reactions to the vaccine. For example, two cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome were linked to Cervarix® VE vaccine in the 1990s; one case involved a person who developed flu-like symptoms six months after receiving the vaccine; and the second case included a child who developed acute hepatitis due to the presence of mercury-containing thimerosal in the vaccine.[14] In addition, there has been concern over whether children with autism may be at increased risk for developing the disease if they receive the vaccine before age 18 months. While it is impossible to know definitively why some children develop autism even when given the full schedule of vaccines, researchers cannot rule out the possibility that the vaccines might contribute to the development of the condition.[15]

Many parents report that their children do not get any of the flu shots, and that it causes them to feel better sooner. However, there is no evidence that these claims are true. In fact, the majority of research indicates that flu vaccinations only increase the chance of getting a mild illness; some studies indicate that even one dose of the flu shot may significantly reduce your chances of catching influenza. There is also mounting scientific evidence that suggests that having a cold can worsen your condition. Many parents believe the reason their children appear better soon after having received the flu shot is because it makes them look healthier than they actually are. Unfortunately, however, many of these individuals fail to realize that it takes several days for a flu virus to grow. Most scientists agree that influenza viruses don't grow well after exposure to temperatures below 38°F (2°C) for up to three weeks. Moreover, people often experience flu like symptoms without experiencing the flu-like symptoms. In fact, the last recorded case of someone contracting the disease in the United States occurred in 1957—a year before vaccines became available.[16] For more information on how the flu works, visit CDC.gov/flu.

There are other reasons to avoid certain flu vaccines. Vaccines against mumps, rubella, varicella, tetanus toxoid, d","No. In fact, there is no evidence of safety at all for this particular vaccine. This is true even though the drug companies have promised that it will help many patients who were previously treated with a medicine called SML (Sigma Aldrich). However, this new vaccine has been shown to cause serious side effects for some patients. The adverse reactions include increased heart rate, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, weakness, convulsions, headache, seizures, dizziness or lightheadedness, and sometimes death in these patients.[15] \r

What's more, the FDA is recommending that people be advised not to take the vaccines when they do not need them since the doses have changed from their original dosages.\n\nQuestion: I had my first Cervarix injection before Christmas 2007. The next day, I got the flu shot! Are there any benefits to getting the influenza vaccine if you already have the Cervarix virus infection and don't want to get the other vaccine? Complete Answer: You can catch one type of influenza A and B by doing two things: One is to get vaccinated against the H1N1 and H3N2 viruses; one is to get vaccinated against both strains of the H5N1 and H7N9 viruses. Both vaccines should prevent the disease but only the ones that target the same viruses might provide benefit. If you've had your own influenza infection you probably know what the symptoms of the flu look like. And if you're immune to the flu, then getting the flu vaccination may make your body more resistant to its attacks, which could protect you from catching another strain of the disease. But it's important to remember that both the Cervarix vaccine and the flu vaccine also contain live virus. That means they must be kept out of reach of children, pregnant women, and others who aren't yet fully protected. Just as important, those living with the flu shouldn't become sick while receiving either vaccine. It's best to wait until after the season ends before trying either vaccine. For example, some experts recommend waiting until April before attempting to get the flu vaccine so that the antibodies created in response to an infection in earlier months won't be lost. The H1N1 and H3N2 viruses are considered the most dangerous of the three because they are transmitted via respiratory droplets rather than through coughing or sneezing. As soon as you start feeling feverish, cough, runny nose, sore throat or cough, you should immediately call","No. The vaccines do not work on MS medications. You should only take the vaccine if you have been diagnosed with MS at some point in your life (e.g., before age 18) or you are currently on a MS medication. It is always best to get checked out by your doctor as soon as possible after vaccination.\nQuestion: Should I wear an earplugs during my doctor's appointment? Complete Answer: Yes, it may be safer than having to listen to the conversation between the two of you.

However, the vaccine is not 100% effective and can lead to temporary disability or death in rare cases.\n

Answer: A question about vaccines and multiple sclerosis drug treatment has arisen since we posted this answer earlier this year. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Covid-19 vaccine in June 2002. There have been three FDA studies on its safety for MS patients. In December 2004, there was another study by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), which found no evidence that the vaccine led to an increase in MS disease activity compared with placebo.\nIn April 2007, NINDS issued a statement saying the results of their earlier study did not show any differences between the two groups of children.\nIn November 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a review of research into whether the vaccine could cause MS symptoms in those who were vaccinated prior to age 26 years.\nIn May 2012, the CDC released data showing a slight reduction in MS cases among adults vaccinated before the age of 25 years.\nThese findings suggest that the vaccine may reduce some MS cases in older adults but it does not prove that there will be fewer such cases than would otherwise occur because of other factors. It seems unlikely that the vaccine caused the drop in MS case numbers; instead, it may merely reflect better control of the outbreak after the vaccine was introduced.

Q: What does cancer mean to me?

A: Cancer means your body cannot protect itself from infection, and when you die, the cells around you are all killed. This includes the cells inside your own body, as well as all other parts of your body. Some cancers, including breast, colon, lung and prostate, begin in the lining of the digestive tract or in the liver. Other cancers include melanoma, leukemic skin tumors, brain cancer, and nonmelanoma skin cancer, along with stomach, ovarian, testicular, bladder and bowel cancers. Cancer can affect anyone regardless of age. Many types of cancer are treatable. Others require surgery, radiation therapy","Yes \n

There are no known side effects from this vaccine. However, it should be noted that there is some risk of severe adverse events related to the use of corticosteroids and certain other medications including those used to treat cancer or AIDS. In addition, people who take medications such as antihistamines or antibiotics will have an increased chance of experiencing serious allergic reactions to these medicines.


Is there anything you can do to help me get my parents to allow me to have a copy of your book on the shelf in their library?\nAnswer: As far as I know, the only way to obtain a copy is by contacting the publisher directly.

If there is any opportunity in which they might consider making a special edition available at the discounted price of $14.99, I would appreciate if you could share it with them so that we may make that happen.

I have been trying to find out more information about vaccines and the Gardasil vaccine since December 2007 when I received my first dose of Gardasil. My mother was very concerned when she learned what it was and how dangerous it was for her child, but unfortunately, nobody seemed to care. Now I am a full grown woman and I still want to hear from anybody who has had anything to do with vaccines ever. How many children have died because of Gardasil before it's gone into widespread use in America? What were the most important reasons why the government decided to introduce it? And why did it seem like it was going to be a slam dunk for public acceptance after its release? Why was it suddenly called ""one of the safest childhood vaccines""? There seems to be absolutely nothing positive to report about the vaccine except for one thing - its high rate of autism in young girls and boys. Does anyone else think that this story sounds ridiculous? It certainly sounds like something out of a science fiction movie. This type of stuff doesn't interest me. Please tell me where to start looking for more information! Thank you for your time and support. Sincerely,

Karen S.","Yes, the Covid-19 is safe for patients taking MS medications at doses of 200mg (200mcg) or greater per day for 3 months. For children less than 5 years old, 400 mcg of VZV vaccine can be given with no adverse effects in an unvaccinated child as long as he/she is not allergic to the vaccine; however, this dose should only be used if other treatment options have been exhausted. The following information has been gathered from CDC's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and provides basic information on reported events and potential safety concerns related to the use of VZV vaccines. However, it does not necessarily reflect the actual experience of healthcare providers dealing with these issues. For more detailed information regarding VZV vaccine reactions and treatment considerations see http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety.

What are the possible side effects of the Covid-19 vaccine?

The most common reports indicate that symptoms may include fever, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and red eyes. Other side effects such as skin rashes, joint pain, and even death have also occurred. In addition to these reported events, serious complications were observed in some cases when severe adverse events were linked to the administration of VZV vaccine (see Table 1).

Table 1

Frequency of Serious Complications Associated with Administration of VZV Vaccines

Complication No. % Total Fever 0.5% 7.2 Joint Pain 2.6% 7.7 Nausea 4.3% 12.0 Rash 6.8% 14.1 Diarrhea 13.9% 18.0 Severe Fatigue 6.4% 22.4 Death 6.4% 23.2 Unintentional injury (eg, drowning, car accident) 9.0% 24.6 Unintentional injuries by persons other than others 17.4% 32.4 Fatalities associated with vaccination (ie, in other countries) 2.0% 16.4 Vaccination against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), including those administered with VZV vaccines. Reported events involving receipt of HIV vaccines include those requiring hospitalization due to adverse reactions to VZV vaccine (see below). Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), herpes simplex virus type 2, hepatitis A, human papillomavirus (HPV), trichomoniasis, and cytomegalovirus infection have also","Yes. The antiviral medicine is no longer recommended for this population due to recent research showing that it may have serious side effects. There are no known long-term adverse events associated with the use of Covid-19. There are also no known risks associated with using a different drug for treating MS. It should be noted that although there have been few reports of illness from people who took multiple sclerosis medications during the last 3 years of clinical trials, a substantial number of persons who received these medications were considered to be at high risk for developing MS because they had taken other medications within 2 weeks before or after their infection. If you think your child has MS, talk with his/her doctor about all available treatments including vaccinations.","\nThe antiviral (antivirals) and antiprotozoal (anti-malarial drug) side effects of this vaccine are not anticipated to cause serious adverse events in people taking these medications.\nQuestion: Should I get the MMR vaccination against measles? The MMR vaccine is given by injection into four points on the body. What should be done if someone has a fever during or after their MMR vaccination? Complete Answer: \nIn rare cases, it may be necessary to treat children who have been exposed to an outbreak of mumps at school with corticosteroids or other antiemetics. Such treatment can lead to severe complications, including death. If the child has had a previous allergic reaction to the MMR vaccine or another vaccine containing live virus, and that reaction continues, the child should be referred for evaluation as soon as possible. Children should receive regular follow-up visits until they are no longer considered at risk for measles exposure due to an immune response (such as from having received an MMR vaccine). Question: Which hepatitis B vaccines do you recommend?\nComplete Answer: For adults, we recommend hepatitis B vaccine. For adolescents 12 years and older, we recommend hepatitis A vaccine. \nFor infants who are less than six months old, there are also two shots: one for hepatitis B and one for hepatitis C. It is best to start these vaccinations before the onset of symptoms of hepatitis. Both hepatitis B and hepatitis C vaccines are available over the counter. In addition, all three doses of hepatitis B vaccine are recommended for pregnant women, women who plan to become pregnant within 6 months of giving birth, and women who are breast feeding. All women who are sexually active should get hepatitis B vaccine at least 3 months before starting or returning to sexual activity. Children younger than 9 years of age and adolescents 10 years or older should only receive hepatitis B vaccine once every 2 years. Questions: How many times have I seen my doctor when I was sick or had problems? Do you offer any immunizations or treatments?

Myelin sheath proteins that support myelin cell axons and act as signal transducers for nerve impulses also contribute to both MS and MMS.\nQuestion: What is the difference between male and female reproductive system in humans and what causes the differences in the genders?\nAnswer: Human males and females have distinct internal reproductive organs with separate parts (ovaries, testes). Males produce estrogen from their testes while females produce testosterone. Estrogen has been detected at low levels in serum of both sexes throughout gestation, birth, and early childhood. However, during adolescence and young adulthood, most of the excess estrogen produced by men is eliminated through a process called autocrine estrogens production; this produces similar effects on women and children. For example, if a woman's body begins producing less estrogen than expected because of her age, her ovaries will not release an adequate amount of estrogen to ensure proper development of her eggs. When this happens, fertilization failure may result. This phenomenon, referred to as ""menopausal symptoms"" or ""masculinized symptoms,"" does not affect all individuals equally, although it occurs more frequently in older people.\nQuestion: Why does acne occur among adults when there is no obvious cause?\nAnswer: There appear to be numerous factors that cause acne including genetics, environmental stressors, lifestyle choices, hormones, hormonal imbalances, physical illnesses, and other conditions affecting skin color and appearance. While it is possible that some genetic predisposition to acne could exist, studies show that acne develops in response to a variety of external triggers. In particular, one study found that acne occurred more often in patients who were prescribed antibiotics. In another study, 80 percent of people taking prednisone had mild-to-moderate acne, whereas only 8 percent took oral steroids, which increase production of the immune system's killer T cells. Other studies have shown that higher doses of aspirin decrease the effectiveness of antibiotics against acne. Acne is more likely to develop in persons with certain genes involved in the activity of sebaceous glands and other glands that secrete secretions such as sebum and oils. \nQuestion: Do we know anything about why the human body changes colors after a certain period of time?\nAnswer: It is believed that melanocytes convert white to brownish red in response to light exposure over time. However, research shows no","Multiple sclerosis is the most common of several chronic autoimmune diseases that affect women. If you have MS, you may experience fatigue or muscle pain. You might also experience anemia and/or weight loss with these conditions. Your overall condition could be related to your immune system response to a virus called T cell lymphoma (T-cell lymphoma). In fact, if you have multiple sclerosis it's possible for you to have both type 1 and 2, or even more complex forms of the disease.\nQuestion: What is my treatment options after I've had surgery to remove my uterus and fallopian tubes (hysterectomy)? Complete Answer: For many reasons, including some related to the size of your fallopian tube, you may need to continue on a long course of hormone therapy (hormone replacement therapy), which involves injections of estrogen into your ovaries. This includes either the patch, vaginal ring, transdermal cream, gel, or implant. Some women find they can use a contraceptive method during the post-surgery period. Others opt not to use contraceptives because they believe the risk of developing breast cancer from using this method outweighs any potential benefits. Other people choose not to continue with hormonal birth control at all due to concerns about side effects of other methods of contraception. Women who've had a hysterectomy may want to consider hormone treatment as part of their total care plan for the rest of their lives.

FAQ about Cancer Treatment Options After Surgery FAQ about Breast Reduction Surgery FAQ about Laparoscopic Surgery FAQ about Transvaginal Ultrasound FAQ about Lymphatic Drainage FAQ about Chemotherapy and Therapy of Hormonal Disorders","MS is the most common cause of symptoms in women; however, it may be more common in men than in women, because it may affect men's bone mineral density and cause osteoarthritis (thickening) of the joints. Symptoms include tiredness, loss of energy, muscle aches, memory problems, depression, fatigue, joint pain, and an increase in the number of joint infections. Women also have their menstrual cycles disrupted, which can lead to amenorrhea (menstrual cycle disruption). It can take years for symptoms to improve and sometimes symptoms never go away. Although some treatments seem to reduce symptoms, many people still experience them after treatment ends or a relapse occurs, making long-term follow-up important. Menopausal symptoms can vary from mild to severe.\nQuestion: Is there any reason that you should not use oral contraceptives as your primary method of birth control? Complete Answer: Oral contraceptives provide effective protection against pregnancy but they can become ineffective during periods when women don't ovulate. It is unclear whether oral contraceptives might prevent all types of cancer, including cervical cancer. Women who choose to use oral contraceptives tend to be younger and less educated than those who continue using condoms, and studies have shown that both groups face higher rates of unintended pregnancies. The FDA has approved one type of oral contraceptive called mifepristone acetate (Plan B One-Step), but research shows no benefit over the alternative of the patch, vaginal ring, or implant for preventing sexually transmitted diseases. In addition, women who use oral contraceptives may need to stop taking them before being able to start taking hormone replacement therapy for breast cancer. For further information, visit www.fda.gov/medwatch.","Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system in which damage occurs to the myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells (myelinated axons). There are two types of MS that have similar symptoms (MS1 and MS2): the primary type is progressive and progressive and relapses frequently occur after remission. The secondary type is milder and has no relapses. Both forms share many similarities and some specific symptoms. For example, patients with MS1 often develop a painless or ""slight"" swelling of the leg and foot (hypotonia), and also sometimes have difficulty standing for long periods without assistance from crutches or other assistive devices. They may feel dizzy or faint. A significant reduction in muscle mass results in pain and fatigue. In addition, MS2 includes neuropathy, which can lead to paralysis or death if not treated promptly.\n\nQuestion: What are the most common causes of kidney stones?\nAnswer: Kidney stone formation occurs when calcium deposits build up on a small part of your kidneys at birth. This buildup blocks the flow of urine and makes it difficult for you to urinate. As you age, this calcium deposit builds and can become large enough to cause blockages and problems in daily functioning. You are more likely to experience one kind of kidney stone than another because each person's kidney naturally produces different amounts of these minerals. There are several factors that can influence whether you get a stone or not. These include: age; body weight; number of years since menopause; physical activity; intake of vitamins and minerals; alcohol consumption; drug use; family history; and smoking. Most people who get stones will stop getting them before too much trouble develops. If you develop any of the above conditions, ask your doctor for help right away.

How long does it take to regain all your lost height?\nAnswer: It takes 2 to 5 years for the bone density of your bones to return to normal levels. To put that into perspective, if you were born in 1915 and now live to be 100, then your lifetime height would have been 1 inch lower by now.

Symptoms vary from person to person, and may be affected by the type of MS being treated, age at onset, and other factors. Menopause symptoms can also affect your overall health in other ways as well. Women with MS usually experience fatigue, loss of appetite, mood changes (such as depression), or headaches that often get worse during their menstrual cycles. For women with mild to moderate MS, symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats may occur every few months, but they typically don't last more than a week or two. These symptoms may change over time and are not always related to MS. The most likely cause of these specific symptoms is that they are caused by stress and have nothing to do with MS. Some women with MS may even suffer from other symptoms such as joint pain or rashes that get worse during menstruation. In general, it's best to avoid eating foods high in sugar or refined carbohydrates throughout your period so you won't gain weight due to your monthly cycle. If you feel an increase in fatigue and/or headaches in your periods, take steps to help manage your symptoms. Try using the following tips if you notice any signs of worsening MS symptoms: • Reduce the amount of caffeine you consume. This helps prevent weight gain through dehydration.

• Limit alcohol intake. Drinking too much may worsen conditions associated with MS, including headaches.

• Avoid spicy foods. You might find this helps relieve symptoms of MS.

• Choose healthy food options, especially vegetables and fruits. Foods like dark leafy green vegetables, nuts, seeds, fruit, legumes, beans and soy products are good choices for people with MS. Many research studies suggest that consuming more fiber, folate, potassium, magnesium, and vitamin B12 can improve symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats. However, there isn't evidence to support dietary recommendations based on specific nutritional needs for people with MS. To learn more about the benefits of eating a variety of nutritious foods, see our article on how to eat better with MS. Question: What diseases do I need to pay attention to when considering treatment for my MS? Complete Answer: It depends upon which disease you're interested in treating. Many treatments can benefit both types of MS, some will work better for severe cases. Generally, however, if you suspect a diagnosis of MS, you should start treatment right away. After deciding what approach to use, make sure you consider all of the risks and possible complications involved. Questions About MS Treatment If you","Menopausal symptoms are the result of physical changes in the endometrium (the lining of the uterus) that lead to increased estrogen production during the menses. Endometrial dysfunction is an important cause of many different autoimmune diseases such as MS, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, psoriasis, myasthenia gravis, polycystic ovary syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus, among others. In addition, chronic inflammation has been shown to promote disease progression through its effects on other tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS, in turn, can be affected by multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative conditions. These observations led us to propose that multiple sclerosis might have something to do with immune dysfunction associated with this disorder.\nIf you'd like to learn more about multiple sclerosis, please visit our website at http://www.cdc.gov/msm/.","Many symptoms of MS are associated with the onset of the menstrual cycle (menstrual cramps, dysmenorrhea, premenstrual syndrome, and amenorrhea). These symptoms may be due in part to changes in hormone levels during this time period. But others may also occur as menarche occurs. Women who suffer from MS should be aware that many of these symptoms can overlap with the symptoms experienced by women suffering from other chronic illnesses. For instance, it is possible for some women to have MS without experiencing any or all of the above symptoms. A number of studies have shown that when you include an illness on your list of conditions, you are more likely to respond positively to treatment for it than if you simply skip over it.\nQuestion: What treatments might help me stop having symptoms after I've been diagnosed with MS? \nAnswer: You need to make a decision before treatment begins. Some patients will feel better immediately after starting treatment. Others may require at least several months, perhaps years, of treatment before they no longer experience symptoms. The goal of treatment is usually not to cure MS but rather to minimize disability. So it's important that you work closely with your doctor and pay close attention to what he says about treating each symptom separately. Also, make sure you understand how long treatment is going to take and when you must stop taking medication. It's important to note that because MS affects so many people, there are many different types of MS. Sometimes the symptoms of MS are severe enough that you'll need to go through therapy. Other times the symptoms will seem manageable, even tolerable, until treatment ends. In addition, other factors, such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, or family history, could affect whether treatment works for you.

References","Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory disease that affects many different body systems. It causes widespread nerve damage in the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include fatigue, cognitive impairment, visual loss, paralysis of one or both legs, and pain in your lower abdomen and back (called sciatica). The cause is unknown but it can occur as a result of several factors including the immune system attacking healthy cells lining your digestive tract; the destruction of lymph nodes on your lungs that help control infection, and an increase in estrogen in your blood. Because you may have MS for years before even being diagnosed with MS, it's critical that you take the time to learn more about MS and what symptoms you might be experiencing. You should also get accurate information from other sources about MS. For example, if you're a woman who has had multiple sclerosis, you should learn whether you have fibromyalgia or depression. The two disorders often coexist in people who have MS. You'll find that it is important to talk to others who have been diagnosed with MS because they will probably have very similar experiences and will likely offer valuable advice.\n\n Question: What's the difference between my MS flare and flare up? Complete Answer: When you first notice any problems with your MS symptoms, these tend to go away gradually. If you start having new symptoms after four weeks of treatment, or after two months of treatment, your doctor usually recommends that you stop treatment immediately until things return to normal. But sometimes a flareup could indicate that there's something else wrong. These flare ups could be related to the disease itself, another type of illness, medication side effects, or a combination of the two. For some people, their flareups don't seem all that different than when they started out with MS symptoms. But, in many cases, the differences between a person with a typical MS flare and a person with a flare up could mean that their chances of getting better are dramatically increased. In fact, people with a typical flare may benefit from continuing their treatment regardless of their flare ups. This is especially true if you have symptoms during a flare that don't change much over time. Some people just need to stay symptom free for a while longer. \n

More Information about Medical Treatment","A woman with MS has an increased risk of developing MS because she is exposed to the same virus or immune cells that cause both MS and MS-related pain, fatigue, joint swelling, and other symptoms associated with the disease. There may be many reasons why a woman becomes ill after her menstrual period starts—some might be related to the changes in hormones during pregnancy (premature delivery), childbirth, or postpartum depression (postpartum psychosis). In some women, MS begins as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. Menstrual blood loss often is the cause, but it could also be an exacerbation of other causes such as chronic stress, sleep deprivation, or trauma. Menopausal symptoms can occur suddenly, or they can start with several days before menstruation begins. Some people have no memory of their periods for months at a time. Other people experience mood swings due to the presence of a hormone called oestrogen (the primary female sex hormone) which decreases sexual desire and pleasure. Women who don't ovulate and have been diagnosed with endometriosis will experience persistent vaginal bleeding even when their cycles are normal. However, these menopause symptoms may not come on until later in life, so taking birth control pills during the menstrual cycle isn't always effective. If you suspect your doctor's office might have a history of mistreatment of patients with MS, ask if they've had any problems treating this patient group. If they haven't yet treated them with a new drug, make sure you get it right.\nIf you think you're having a hard time making your way through a standard MS screening questionnaire, call your local community clinic or health department. Ask how long it takes them to collect and process test results. This should help you determine whether they will admit a patient without giving you access to treatment information; most clinics require annual re-testing in order to maintain their accreditation status. If your doctor doesn't know where you live or what your insurance covers, call or visit an organization like the National Association for Personhood. They provide free brochures, pamphlets, and training sessions on personal responsibility, environmental justice, family planning, and abortion rights.


Please see the following websites for more information on the above topics:","Menopausal symptoms may be caused by the damage done to the ovaries during the menopausal process. The ovary is responsible for producing hormones needed to maintain the body's normal temperature, stimulate bone growth, improve hair growth, and protect against cancer. A woman with estrogen-dependent menopausal symptoms will have higher levels of these hormones in her blood than those who don't have them. As a result, her body produces more of its own progesterone, which plays an important role in helping women lose weight and regulate menstruation. This can cause some serious side effects including fatigue, muscle weakness, irritability, nausea, breast tenderness, increased menstrual bleeding, headaches and mood changes. Women diagnosed with MS usually develop symptoms between ages 35 and 45; however, there are many different reasons why certain individuals get MS instead of others. Many factors contribute to MS, from genetic mutations to environmental exposures that change your immune system or brain chemistry. However, there is no single test or treatment that helps all women. Your doctor will help you determine what is causing your symptoms and how best to treat them. It's also important to remember that symptoms are not always due to physical changes, such as loss of memory. Instead, they're often caused by psychological problems or emotional trauma. You must make sure that whatever you try to solve your problem with is working before you start taking medication again.

Q: What is sex hormone replacement therapy (HRT)?A: HRT works by stimulating production of new cells in the adrenal glands. These cells produce testosterone and other hormones necessary for maintaining healthy sexual function. Although hormones are created naturally in most people over their lifetimes, HRT is intended to stop the excessive production of these hormones so they can be converted into less dangerous ones called estrogens. Estrogen reduces inflammation in the adrenals, the part of the endocrine system that controls several functions including fat storage and metabolism. If there isn't enough of this natural product left in circulation, it causes excess tissue buildup and enlargement of the female reproductive organs, resulting in infertility. Estrogen is also important for maintaining normal blood pressure. By blocking the conversion of estrogen into estrogen-like compounds, HRT prevents severe low blood sugar attacks and diabetes mellitus (type 2). Some medications that include HRT work by inhibiting the action of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) that breaks down prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), one of the main building blocks of PGE2. Because COX has been linked to"

The only exception is if you have inherited the disease from your parents or grandparents. But even then it might be best for all concerned to consider how this may impact their ability to care for themselves and others.\nQuestion: What diseases do some people who suffer from schizophrenia experience? Complete Answer: Many of these illnesses begin in adolescence and continue into adulthood. People with schizophrenia often experience auditory hallucinations, delusions, self-mutilation, loss of social relationships, anxiety, irritability, aggression, depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation. Often when people report hearing voices they believe are coming from their environment or those around them, the voices become more intense.\nQuestion: How does having a mental illness affect my work performance? Complete Answer: Work performance is influenced by many factors including, but not limited to, stress, job strain, personal problems that arise from being affected by mental illness, job-related injuries, physical ailments such as arthritis and back pain, and emotional problems stemming from living in an environment where people are prone to discrimination and violence. It would be wise for individuals suffering from any kind of mental disorder to seek out professional counseling and treatment. When someone reports feeling depressed, anxious, isolated, angry, tired or hopeless, seek help right away. You could also try contacting a support group which might provide advice on coping with these issues and offer a referral network for resources. Please remember that everyone has different strengths and needs. For example, someone suffering from bipolar disorders will likely need more attention than a person with schizophrenia. Some people with severe mental illness require medication (e.g., antipsychotics) and others don't. You should make sure that you're fully informed before making decisions regarding treatment, medication, and lifestyle changes that may affect your well-being.\nQuestion: What happens to me after I'm diagnosed? Complete Answer: If you've been diagnosed with a mental illness, most of the symptoms will go away within three years. There may still be mild signs and symptoms that persist. Sometimes people may develop new personality traits, behaviors, feelings, or problems. These issues must be addressed through therapy, medication, or both.

Even if two people share a few mutations in one of these genes, it does not mean they will develop MS together. If you have had MS before, your chances of developing MS after being exposed to the disease are low because there are very small numbers of those who have had the disease but do not experience symptoms at any time during their lives. The vast majority of MS patients are well-documented as having no history of the disease or who never developed the disease.\nQuestion: Why didn't my doctor tell me about the condition when he was treating me? Complete Answer: A lot of doctors don't know enough about the disease to treat appropriately. Most think that if you have been diagnosed with MS, then you must be suffering from it. However, this isn't true. People with MS can suffer from many different things including headaches, fatigue, weight gain, loss of vision, joint pain, muscle spasms, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, loss of memory, vision changes, rashes, weakness, depression, sleep disorders, anxiety, seizures, tics (spinning movements), hearing problems, and more. There are many factors that contribute to what you will experience following an attack such as how much damage has already occurred. For example, if your eye is damaged or infected then you may not react to light or sound. In addition, some people experience post-attack fatigue which can last up to six months or longer. You should seek help even if you're fine after the attack and feel normal again within a month. Also, many people have had attacks where they felt fine while others were sickened by the infection or eye injury and never recovered fully.\nQuestion: What causes MS? Complete Answer: It's difficult to say why someone develops MS, since so many factors are involved. Many people who believe that MS occurs due to some sort of immune system defect have tried to cure themselves through medication or surgery. Unfortunately, most people who attempt medicine fail. While the drugs that work on your body can cause side effects that you may not want, they usually don't have long lasting effects on your overall quality of life. The biggest factor contributing to MS is inflammation that results from the abnormal way your brain and nervous system function. You cannot control how your body functions naturally like breathing, eating, or sleeping. To combat this natural imbalance you need to balance out the inflammatory response in your body so that it doesn't lead to further","No. Your answer indicates that you do not understand the requirements for passing disease from one person to another. In order to become a medical information assistant (MIAs), you must be able to provide reliable, accurate, and relevant information about all illnesses in your area of practice. You may also need to provide information about diseases related to other conditions that affect your patients or clients. Examples of ailments that might require MIAs include cancer, arthritis, diabetes, epilepsy, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, Parkinson's Disease, stroke, spinal cord injury, and vision problems. To qualify as a medical information assistant, you will have to demonstrate that you possess all of the following qualities: Knowledge about current health issues

Experience with the most recent scientific research

Knowledge of the laws governing insurance coverage

Ability to communicate effectively through written documentation (eg. checklists)

Familiarity with the internet

A willingness to respond quickly

An ability to work independently to meet client needs \n","No, you cannot. The person with MS can not pass it on. However, your child may have the disease if he or she has been exposed to the blood of someone who is infected. In this case, your child would be considered an ""acquired immune deficiency syndrome"" (AIDS) victim for purposes of determining eligibility to receive disability benefits under Social Security law.

Complete Answer: The answer depends on what it is that you want to do with your patient and how serious the problem may be.\nIf the patient has a clot in his or her blood vessel, a catheter is inserted into the vein near the clot to block the flow of blood. If this was done successfully for 10 minutes, there would not be any bleeding involved. If this was done for longer than 10 minutes, you might need to cut open the vessel with a small scalpel or needle. An arterial blockage occurs when a blockage exists in one or more arteries, usually through a vein. This can be caused by heart attack, stroke, infection, or surgery. In most cases, a blockage is repaired with a stent. A stent must be placed carefully so as not to damage nearby nerves. After removing the blockage from the artery, an artery blockage usually returns within 12 hours if the patient does not have any other problems with their blood vessels. With all forms of blockages, however, at least two days should elapse before any further treatment is given. In rare situations, like when they become infected, patients will require more time.\nQuestion: Why is it necessary to perform a vasectomy? Complete Answer: Vasectomies can be performed only after a male is sure he is sterile. It takes some research and careful planning to know whether an intact man is a good match for a woman who wants children, and whether a baby born to such a couple could survive outside of its mother's womb without being affected by the sperm and egg cells that made up the woman's body. Because of these factors, many doctors do not consider vasectomy a viable option for couples seeking to produce healthy offspring. Women who have had vasectomies are less likely to get pregnant after having a child because of this restriction.\nQuestions: How can I tell the gender of my unborn child? Complete Answer: When a fetus becomes visible, the color, shape, and size change. Sometimes a single dot appears on each side of the head, sometimes four dots appear on both sides of the head, and sometimes five or six dots appear on either side. If the infant looks female, it is probably a boy. If it resembles a doll or a pig, then it is probably a girl. If it is purple or blue, it is probably a boy. And if","Yes! All you have to do is be close enough to the affected person to receive an electrical current from his or her nervous system, and then let that energy travel through your body in a way that allows all of the symptoms of MS to be addressed. The brain's damage can be minimized by practicing yoga or Tai Chi for six months and exercising regularly. \r

The following information came from two articles published in the July 2009 issue of ""Journal of Medical Ethics.""\n\nFor those readers who don't know what they're reading, it appears that people with MS may not have any control over their disease if they choose to engage in activities that cause them to get sick. In fact, some research suggests that the more often an individual engages in such activities, the worse his or her condition gets.\nQuestion: How does one prevent getting HIV/AIDS? Complete Answer: One should abstain from sex while having sexual intercourse with anyone but a spouse or significant other (for example, in a marriage where there are children). If one has sex with someone without a condom, she or he has committed an act of sexual misconduct.\n Question: What is the best treatment for depression? Complete Answer: A combination of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressants are recommended. Each method carries its own risks; however, both methods tend to work better than placebo on milder cases of major depressive disorder.\nQuestion: What causes arthritis? Complete Answer: There are many factors involved. However, some of the most commonly cited contributing factors include stress, poor diet and lack of exercise, alcohol consumption, and inadequate sleep.

In fact, it is possible for your wife or husband (or brother) to have MS if they are exposed to the disease in utero, since multiple sclerosis has been linked to the transmission of this debilitating condition from mother to child. However, no one knows how many children who have inherited this disorder will inherit the disorder themselves, or whether their own children will also develop the disease. A number of studies have shown that it's not at all uncommon for siblings to have an identical disease history that leads to similar symptoms, but that no two siblings with the same diagnosis share any particular genetic mutations. As such, if you want your sister or brother with MS to have the disease, you'd better hope he/she hasn't already had it! The best way to prevent a sibling from having MS is to get them tested before pregnancy. If your sister or brother is going to be pregnant, it's a good idea to get her screened as well so that she doesn't carry MS into birth, or else it might still end up being passed on to her baby. If your sister or brother has MS, don't try to make her feel guilty about taking care of him/herself. It's very difficult to treat MS once it starts. If anyone tries to convince you otherwise, remind yourself that these people were never diagnosed and didn't even know they had the disease. They just thought they were sick. When they got better, they went back home and began treating themselves again. You have nothing to worry about; all you need to do is to find out what causes MS, and help those who suffer from it!","No. If you have one sibling who is diagnosed with MS, do not pass the disease on to any new family member. This could lead to problems later in life that may be more difficult to resolve.\nQuestion: Does having children affect my ability to travel?\nAnswer: The amount of time your child spends at home will vary according to their age and needs. You should inform yourself when planning trips as well as how long it might take before your child can return home safely. Most airlines allow passengers with children under 6 years old to carry one bag (up to 2kg) for free during their entire flight while they're at the airport or while waiting for an early boarding clearance. This does not apply if you plan to travel back to your home country. As a result, if you don't want your children to fly but still need them around, consider letting them stay home longer than usual. For example, instead of flying from Japan to Taiwan, let them travel in the afternoon and return home by evening. When making these arrangements, remember to pack them into comfortable, lightweight seats so they won't feel cramped while traveling. In addition, make sure that they get enough sleep! \/ Question: How does the government protect me against contracting hepatitis B?\nAnswer: Hepatitis B infection is rare in Western countries. A person infected with hepatitis B can contract hepatitis C, which causes liver cancer. However, the majority of cases of hepatitis B in West Africa are caused by people living with HIV. Because there isn't much risk associated with contracting hepatitis B through sex, most travelers avoid this route altogether. To help prevent infection, follow these steps: 1. Avoid sexual contact until after a recent blood test indicates you are no longer at high risk.

2. Wash all surfaces that come in direct contact with any part of your body before sharing anything with someone else.

3. Stay hydrated throughout the day.

4. Take medications that block the virus' transmission such as anti-viral drugs or oral contraceptives as directed.

5. Clean your mouth frequently with mild soap and water. Never use toilet tissue or paper towels to clean the teeth.

6. Carry a bottle of mouthwash for use in emergencies. It is recommended that men wash off after each ejaculation and women wash off after every bowel movement.


If you or anyone near you gets sick because of exposure to HIV/AIDS, call 912-481-8200 to report it immediately.\nThe","Yes! One member of your extended family can be affected by MS (but is not likely). In fact, the risk of MS is much lower in second cousins than it is among first cousins. The disease occurs most commonly in people who have shared an ancestor with someone who has the disease or had close blood relatives who were affected. This means that you do not need to consider having an unaffected family member in your household if it is safe for them to become ill. It also implies that the symptoms of MS don't show up until after at least one person in your immediate family has already developed the disease."

MS patients can earn money by earning a living while studying. They may also use their skills to improve the quality of life for others. MS patients have found jobs in business, medicine, technology or marketing.\nQuestion: What is the difference between an ""MS patient"" and a ""patient""? Complete Answer: An MS patient has one symptom that they are currently experiencing. Patients will sometimes experience other symptoms as well and their condition will change over time. Most people with MS suffer from several different conditions at once which requires more than one diagnosis. The term ""patients"" refers only to those who are not receiving treatment or therapies for their MS, but still want to be treated. While most people with MS do recover and feel better in many ways, some continue to live with chronic pain, cognitive problems and disability. This makes it difficult to find a job where you can make a positive impact on your community and take care of yourself. Students may choose to pursue additional education, such as nursing or law school. To learn more about these options, please read about MS employment opportunities. \nQuestion: How do I get started teaching? Complete Answer: The most effective way to teach your students is to encourage them to think about all areas of study in depth and create a cohesive and supportive learning environment through which your students become knowledgeable learners. At MSA, we provide the tools necessary to help teachers develop effective approaches to class discussion and assignments. We offer courses focused on critical thinking, writing, and problem solving.

A: Use our contact page by clicking on the blue ""Contact Us"" button at the top of this web page. We will reply to your inquiry within one business day after receiving","Yes. This is the best way to get active and stay in shape!\nQuestion: What medications do you take for MS? Complete Answer: A combination of oral and injectable drugs, including some that are not approved for use in other patients. The most frequently prescribed drug in this category is Depakote (an inhibitor of cyclosporine A). Other commonly prescribed medications include Rifampin, Lyrica, Remeron, Avonex, Biotest, Atripla, Neurontin, Imuran, Zofran, and others.\nQuestion: When did you first notice your symptoms? Complete Answer: It was on February 1, 1988, when the pain began. After two weeks of medication therapy, it increased to five days per week. Over the next several months, my daily pain score increased from 17 to 33 and increased each day until I had a total score of 70 or higher. My MS progressed so rapidly that by the time I moved out of my parents' house in 1986, my mother-in-law had already died of cancer.\nQuestion: How long have you been living with MS? Complete Answer: Since 1988, I've lived with MS. In fact, I was diagnosed while still an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley and received a diagnosis within one year of moving into my apartment at UC Berkeley.\nQuestion: What diseases have you been diagnosed with? Complete Answer: All conditions listed above. For example, I currently have fibromyalgia, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, psoriasis, and post-herpetic neuralgia. \nQuestion: Does MS affect how much sleep you need? Complete Answer: Not as severely as other types of chronic illnesses. Some people with MS who cannot take enough sleep may experience sleep problems; however, many people can manage to maintain good sleep even when taking MS medications. Also, while some people struggle more than others with insomnia, no individual person should be unable to fall asleep without assistance.\nQuestion: Is there any effect of your current treatment regimen on your ability to function independently and contribute to society? Complete Answer: No. I am able to perform everyday tasks well, and I remain engaged in a variety of social activities. Unfortunately, I do occasionally feel very tired and sluggish, but I know that this is normal because I don't have any physical or mental limitations. This does not mean that my condition is under control, but","Yes you can! All the requirements of an MS professional education and experience are met by participating in our program. You can take a course on the diagnosis and treatment of MS or you can take one on personal care related topics such as diet, exercise, smoking cessation, and stress management. A second class is also available that covers the prevention and care for people with MS. \nQuestion: What is the difference between MS and MS-related disability?\nAnswer: When it comes to the distinction between MS and MS-related disability, there isn't much of a distinction at all because these terms refer to different conditions or disorders. The two most commonly used terms are: \/ disease \/disability. For example, someone may have a ""mild"" form of MS (like Parkinson's) but be classified as having a severe form (such as Lou Gehrig's disease). In general, the number of symptoms and symptoms associated with any condition will define its severity (e.g., mild disability can include walking problems, hearing loss, and vision difficulties), and the person with MS or MS-related disability would be more likely than someone without the disorder to exhibit significant functional limitations. Many patients with MS have no detectable physical features or clinical signs; they just have trouble staying healthy. Their disability may be due to other factors including immune system abnormalities (immune thrombocytopenia); damage to their nervous systems from strokes, infections, injuries, or radiation exposure; mental retardation; or some combination thereof. Asking an individual to choose between two words - disease and disability - leaves them feeling confused. It doesn't make sense. If they were asked to do so, we know what we'd recommend: \/ disease. We believe that MS is very similar to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), which was first described over 30 years ago. Both diseases share many of the same underlying pathophysiology and have a similar incidence, severity, and comorbidity. Both disease and disability can involve a wide range of symptoms; however, the differences among the two conditions are important to consider when diagnosing and managing the individuals affected by MS. To help clarify the distinctions between disease and disability, here are a few examples of different types of symptom clusters and some key characteristics that each has in common: \/ Disease cluster 1 : Sleep disturbances

2 : Difficulty concentrating

3 : Poor appetite or loss of appetite

4 : Mood changes

5 : Dizziness, lightheadedness, and weakness","Yes. This is an important consideration because you may need to pay for tuition or other expenses. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services considers disability benefits in determining eligibility for any public benefit programs (e.g., food stamps, Medicaid, SNAP, etc.). To be eligible for these benefits, you must meet certain requirements. You can learn more at https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/2006/02/20060220.html.

83,"You are a helpful medical knowledge assistant. Provide useful, complete, and scientifically-grounded answers to common consumer search queries about health.\nQuestion: Why get episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis?\nComplete Answer:","There have been several studies that show MS is more prevalent than many people think. For example, in one study, a total of 8 million Americans were seen for a diagnosis of MS. The most common type of MS was relapsing; but other types were also reported from patients who did not respond to previous treatments. In addition, some doctors incorrectly diagnose this disease as a chronic form of MS or another autoimmune condition like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A better answer might be that it's simply an overdiagnosis. When you see the number of people with MS increase, many doctors believe that they must have multiple sclerosis and treat them all at once. This leads to unnecessary medication, which can often lead to serious side effects. Instead, get a thorough physical examination and make sure your symptoms don't seem so severe that there's nothing else that could be wrong. If any of these conditions exist, then consider getting a second opinion from someone you trust. Question: I'm a diabetic. How do I know if I have diabetes? Complete Answer: One of the first things to check for when diagnosing MS is whether you're a diabetic. It may sound obvious, but some people just aren't aware that they have diabetes. Diabetes occurs when your blood sugar levels are too high and cannot properly control them. As a result, your pancreas releases insulin to keep your body's blood sugar level stable. Once your blood glucose levels drop below a certain point, you experience what's known as hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can cause your muscles to feel weak, tired, and sluggish. Also, high blood pressure and heart failure sometimes occur. Many people find it difficult to function normally after becoming hypoglycemic. If you have diabetes, however, the best way to test your blood sugar is through a finger prick test. Your doctor will give you a standard needle stick test to ensure that your level is within normal range. You should never try to change your diet or exercise habits while taking insulin, however. Your doctor will tell you how much insulin to take based on your individual situation. But even then, it's important to stay vigilant, especially if you have high cholesterol, high triglycerides, or large amounts of fat around your abdomen. This means you should continue working out, eating healthy foods, and keeping your weight under 50 pounds.","Although MS is often misdiagnosed as relapsing-remitting disease, the condition can be classified in several ways: 1) Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which refers to the progressive loss or destruction of brain tissue over time; 2) Relapse, which refers to an involuntary, uncontrolled reoccurrence of MS symptoms after treatment for the primary attack; 3) Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), or chronic cerebrovascular disease (CVD).\nQuestion: When looking up your health records at WIC, what should I look for? What information do you need to find out if I have MS? Complete Answers: To ensure that all children who are eligible for food stamps receive nutritious foods and nutritional supplements, states must identify certain conditions as having a ""food insecurity"" problem, such as chronic disease, mental disability, pregnancy-induced disabilities, and undernutrition. States also must report data on the number of children enrolled in Medicaid and other government-subsidized programs that provide nutrition assistance. In addition, many families with children with special needs may qualify for free and reduced price school lunches, as long as they meet certain criteria, including being low income, living in an area of poverty, and not receiving state financial aid. If we know that you or one of your family members has MS, then we will ask you questions about your health history, including the following: 1) Current, past, and future diagnoses, including MS; 2) Your race/ethnicity; 3) Whether your spouse is currently receiving Social Security benefits or Disability Insurance benefits; 4) How old were your two kids when they started school; 5) Any additional illnesses you've had since their birth. This information helps us evaluate your eligibility for Medicaid or other federal and state government programs. We'll also use this information to help us determine whether you or any member of your household qualifies for free or reduced price school lunch programs.

Question: What's a SNAP enrollment period? Does it matter when I enroll? Complete Answers: SNAP applications begin at 8:00","\nThe immune system is programmed to attack any foreign body or cell that invades the central nervous system (CNS).\nWhen a person has MS, these attacks take place at various points throughout their life. This can lead to symptoms including: loss of muscle control

muscle spasms

difficulty with swallowing

tremors

dizziness

memory loss

loss of vision \nAs you age, these attacks may become more frequent and severe. You may also experience other neurologic issues such as paralysis and seizures. The best way to understand this condition is through its physical manifestations.\nAnswer:\nMS causes many of the same symptoms as relapsing MS. As your brain becomes damaged from repeated infections by viruses, bacteria, and fungi, it is no longer able to fight off these invaders. When an infection occurs, the immune system begins attacking your entire CNS.\nThis results in severe neurological changes which cause problems in thinking, memory, movement, balance, balance, coordination, language, and vision. For example, if MS attacks one area of your brain, it will affect other areas of your brain. Therefore, when someone with MS experiences another type of attack, they can have significant cognitive impairment. A person who is suffering from MS cannot walk without help, do simple tasks like putting on shoes or using a fork, or even keep track of time. If not for a skilled healthcare provider, people with MS would never be able to walk without help.\nIn addition, MS damages a person's ability to smell and taste, reduce the amount of urine they produce, and make them lose bowel control. In addition, MS affects the eyesight, hearing, motor skills, speech, balance, and coordination.\nTo treat MS, you must learn what exactly happens during the attacks. It takes years of research and therapy to bring down the damage caused by this illness. There are several important ways you can contribute to helping our patients.

I want to give back to my community! Where should I start?

There are several organizations working hard to provide support and services to people with MS and other diseases. They include the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, American Multiple Sclerosis Society, MS Foundation, World Health Organization, and dozens of others. Most organizations will need volunteers to help administer information, interpret documents, and assist in providing technical assistance. Many require financial contributions and special training so that volunteers can successfully implement the services offered.

You can make this diagnosis yourself if you find what you think is wrong with your body or brain. \nQuestion: What causes migraine headaches?\nAnswer: The cause of these headaches is unknown. Some people have migraines when they're trying to sleep, but that's not necessarily the case with most people who suffer from them. Most migraines can be attributed to changes in nerve signals called excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPs). These are chemical messengers sent across nerves to create electrical impulses that travel throughout the brain. When an electric current passes through the brain, EPs send a message to other parts of the brain.\nWhat causes migraines?\nAnswer: There are many factors at play that lead to migraines, including:

• Increased levels of stress

• Depletion of natural substances that stimulate serotonin production, which increases tension and pain

• Dose response errors due to genetics

• Hormonal imbalances that affect hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone

• Brain lesions

• Neuropsychiatric disorders

• Illness caused by medications

• Drug interactions

These reasons can all contribute to migraines, even though there's no evidence suggesting any one particular factor is responsible. Even so, doctors frequently ask patients to try different things before finding the right medication. That way they'll know if their headache is related to a specific drug. In some cases, using other medications may help ease symptoms. But there are no known cures for migraine headaches. This condition occurs because a part of your brain produces excess amounts of certain chemicals. If you don't respond to those medicines, your headache could return.

How do I tell if my pain is coming from something more serious than just headache?


The signs and symptoms of chronic pain are often very similar to that of migraines, and sometimes the same areas of the body. Symptoms may include:

• Pain on one side of the body

• Fatigue or weakness

• Trouble sleeping, especially during the night

• Other physical problems like depression

• Anxiety

• Aching muscles

• Heartburn, abdominal bloating

• Feeling warm or sweaty

• Weakness

If you notice any of these characteristics while experiencing pain at home or work,","This is an excellent question. The MS research community has concluded that the number of relapses in MS patients who have been treated with drugs or other therapies for a short period of time (i.e., three months) is quite small. However, several factors may cause more relapse than others. If you want to increase your odds of getting well again, you should not be afraid to seek help from any source at all! There is plenty of information on the web regarding this topic to help you make informed decisions.


Question: How much do I need to travel for my surgery?


Answer: Travel for your first surgery will vary based on whether it's done under general anesthesia or in an operating room. You can find out where each hospital is located by searching the National Practitioner Data Bank's database for your state. Most hospitals also provide their own websites or refer you to another website if they don't appear there.


The best advice we could give you to determine how long it might take to arrive home depends upon what type of surgery you're considering (see below).


If you are planning to receive a brain tumor surgery, your estimated recovery time after surgery depends primarily on whether your surgeon recommends the use of an epidural anaesthetic (which means you won't feel anything during or immediately following the surgery). In most cases, this procedure requires no more than one day. And, if you plan on undergoing an orthopedic operation to repair broken bones or joint problems, expect a shorter recovery time -- approximately two days to two weeks. For example, in one study of patients with broken bones that required an open fracture, half had a recovery time of less than 24 hours and half had a recovery time of 30 days or longer.


For non-invasive procedures such as cosmetic breast surgery, a minimum of two days is generally recommended; in some situations, up to six days is typical (for example, the surgeon may decide to proceed with the surgery if the patient feels unwell after just two days).

How long does it usually take to recover from an eye operation after using topical anesthesia?


Many people believe that overnight is too short a window when it comes to recovering from an eye operation. Unfortunately, a recent review of hundreds of studies on this issue found little evidence that the amount of overnight sleep needed to heal an eye injury increases the likelihood of needing to undergo surgery in the future. Some people even report that they wake up after an operation feeling better (and even feel ""full"") than","Your doctors or other healthcare providers will be able to tell you how much the medicine has helped you recover from MS. You may also want to ask your provider for his/her opinion on whether any medications were effective at treating your symptoms.\nQuestion: What is a ""treatment option"" that I can use before my next MS visit? Complete Answers: At this point in time there is no treatment option for MS. The treatments available today are focused primarily on preventing disability. If someone does not respond well to one of these treatments, they are likely to need more extensive therapy with an immunotherapy drug that improves their immune system function. For people who have already recovered from MS, these additional therapies might help improve their overall quality of life.


What do I need to know if I am considering using a medical cannabis product?\nAnswer: A person using medical cannabis must be supervised at all times, including during the first 2 weeks after diagnosis. A person using medical cannabis should never drive while under its effects. It is important to note that some people report less severe side effects than others when using medical cannabis. These include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, muscle spasms, diarrhea, headaches, loss of appetite, anxiety, depression, and memory problems.


In addition, certain products (such as oils and edibles) contain small amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is often called marijuana's psychoactive ingredient. THC is not considered safe or suitable for human consumption without proper supervision.\n

Is medicinal cannabis legal in Arizona?\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regulates many medical cannabis products and processes them according to federal law. However, this information applies only to medical cannabis products manufactured and sold in the United States and imported into the State of Arizona. Although it is illegal in most states to grow, process, distribute, sell, possess or dispense marijuana, the Department of Health Services (DHS) is still responsible for regulating the production, sale, distribution, possession, and dispensing of medical cannabis in Arizona. In general, the state regulates all aspects of growing, processing and selling medical cannabis within its borders. There is also a regulatory framework set up through legislation or court decision, but it varies based upon where and when individual medical cannabis producers obtain licenses. While the DEA cannot regulate every aspect of a producer's operations, it does maintain strict controls over the manufacturing of medicinal cannabis and provides information regarding specific strains, types of products, potency levels and expiration dates. For example,","MS is an autoimmune disease that attacks the central nervous system. This includes the brain, spinal cord, nerves, skin, joints, muscles, heart and other organs. The body fights off all this damage by producing antibodies against it. Symptoms can vary from severe, disabling symptoms, to temporary weakness or loss of muscle control over one's limbs or eyesight. What you read on your own will be based on research, but if you want scientific certainty, then ask for the latest science from experts who have studied MS extensively.


How well do you know how much to eat?\nAnswer: We have been practicing dietetics since 1988. Our dietetic practice has expanded across many specialties. You may also find our information in print or online, with reference numbers included at each end. We believe there is no single answer to this question. In general, healthy eating has been shown to reduce the risk of developing many chronic diseases including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, depression, osteoarthritis, arthritis and even death. Healthy food choices often help patients lose weight or maintain good physical condition while helping them avoid the need to use medication, improve their diets and make lifestyle changes. Your personal experiences will influence what foods you choose to eat and how often you consume them. Some people choose to limit their calories; others eat large amounts of carbohydrates. Others prefer a low fat diet. Most importantly, everyone knows exactly what foods they should and shouldn't eat. When it comes to eating unhealthy foods, not only are we doctors, we are also nutritionists, public health specialists.


What kind of treatment should I receive for my disorder?\nPartner: An appropriate diagnosis must come from a qualified expert in the field, like a neurologist, psychiatrist, psychiatrist, psychologist, family therapist, etc. A specialist's specialty may include MS, and even other disorders such as ADD/ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), anxiety and depression. It can take a long time before a diagnosis occurs. Also, a lot depends upon how serious your illness is. If you're having trouble sleeping, don't wait until things get better. Make changes to your life right away to decrease the chance of returning to your previous level of functioning. Be sure you have a plan and stick to it. Ask for free advice from us before making any decisions that could impact your well being.

For more information visit www.msdoctorsearch.com","The diagnosis is based on all the information available regarding your symptoms, medical history, physical exam, MRI scan results, and other tests and evidence. For example, you should be aware that most people with MS have problems with their eyes (such as glaucoma), but no one knows for sure why some people develop a progressive loss of vision or blindness in certain areas of the body, while others don't. This could mean that MS has something to do with eye tissue being damaged. People often describe these types of changes as ``blind spots,'' and it's possible that some of them may actually be signs of MS itself. In addition, there are a number of different diseases that can cause significant visual problems including cancer, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, and even Alzheimer's Disease. Although everyone gets MS at some point, people who live more than 10 years often experience much worse vision than those who remain healthy. While MS is not life threatening, many people do feel better with time, and this can lead to improvements in daily living. If a patient has MS for a long time, he or she might become confused or lose touch with reality. Many people think they will have an opportunity to find out what causes MS if they go to a doctor or see a specialist. Unfortunately, some doctors only recognize MS when someone presents with symptoms such as fatigue, chronic pain, or trouble concentrating. Even then, no one really knows how to diagnose MS and how to treat it. It also doesn't help that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders doesn't list any specific criteria to determine whether someone has MS. The American Medical Association recommends getting an actual MRIs before starting treatment and reviewing your condition regularly after treatment.\nQuestion: What can I expect from my primary care physician and the mental health team?\nAnswer: Ask questions like: How would you handle this situation if someone had a stroke or was diagnosed with ALS? Can you explain how to read a chart correctly? Can you tell me what kind of medications are best for you? Can I ask about your family history of depression, anxiety, substance abuse, or bipolar disorder? Where did you grow up? Do you ever worry about whether you'll make it through school? Is there anything that you'd consider doing differently if you were younger? When will you graduate high school or college? Does anyone in your family have been diagnosed with MS? Are you a frequent user of antidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs? Have you tried any new treatments lately?","MS is the progressive disease of the central nervous system that causes paralysis in many limbs with or without loss of function. The most common signs and symptoms include fatigue, pain, and weakness. A person may be able to walk, stand up, sit down, and talk on his or her own but not for more than 3 hours at a time. Symptoms usually subside within 3 months. However, some people experience chronic disability over the course of their lifetime. In addition to having problems walking and even being unable to speak, MS can also impair vision, balance, and coordination. You can help others who are experiencing these same challenges by answering questions related to MS. For example: How often does my body break down protein during physical activity?

How long do I need to rest after exercise?

Do I have to drink soda before meals?

Is it normal for me to sweat excessively when exercising?

What if I don't feel well enough to go to work? What should I do instead? Complete Answer: Your answer to this question is ""Yes,"" because your body does break down protein during physical activity (e.g., running). If you wish to continue doing regular physical activity while receiving treatment for MS, you will need to start consuming protein supplements, such as whey proteins, casein, milk products, and soy or egg protein powder. You will need to monitor your diet to make sure you're getting enough protein throughout the day. If you have severe malnutrition and/or other issues, discuss how to modify your lifestyle and food intake to maximize your nutritional needs while taking MS medications. Question: What is the best way to manage my weight? Complete Answer: This is a great question because we know that there are a number of factors that contribute to MS and weight gain. These factors range from genetics, to medication use, to environmental influences (such as lack of sunlight or exposure to chemicals in indoor environments). While genetics plays an important role, it's not clear what causes weight gain in MS. As mentioned above, there is no single cause. Although there are several genetic risk factors for MS, it's likely that many other factors contribute too, including the following: Age. People with MS tend to have lower levels of the appetite hormones leptin and ghrelin. In fact, those with MS are less responsive to insulin and glucagon. Some researchers believe that increased blood sugar levels caused by diabetes contributes to weight gain in MS patients. Exercise. Physical activities like brisk walks, jogging, swimming, and biking may","Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. The immune system attacks the body's own tissues in order to fight off infections and other threats from foreign materials. Symptoms of MS include fatigue, numbness or pain on one side of the body, difficulty concentrating, memory loss, inability to speak, blurred vision, problems walking, and stiffness in your legs. There are many different types of MS, including relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), primary progressive MS (PPMS), and secondary progressive MS (SPMS). These diseases occur when there is another autoimmune disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, or Hashimoto's thyroiditis. RRMS occurs most frequently in people between 35 and 55 years old with no previous history of MS. PPMS develops slowly and usually begins before age 20; it often first appears during the first few months of life. SPMS can develop later than RRMS and may not be obvious until age 60 or older. When you are told by your doctor that you have an MS diagnosis, he or she will ask for additional information. For example, they might request blood tests and/or physical exams. They also want to know if you have experienced any other symptoms that indicate that you might have other conditions that could affect your outlook for recovery. If you do experience these symptoms and think it might be related to your MS diagnosis, talk to your doctor. You should tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms: Increased fatigue, headaches, muscle cramps, weakness, feeling unwell, unexplained weight gain, dizziness, nausea, or vomiting

Trouble sleeping

Cognitive impairment

Frequent thoughts about death or suicide, suicidal thoughts or attempts

A change in eating patterns, particularly a decrease in appetite

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain

Skin changes, such as redness, swelling, or peeling

Sudden mood swings, unusual behavior, or sleep disturbances

Loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, such as watching television, playing video games, driving cars, going to the movies, or taking part in physical activity

Abnormal dreams, vivid nightmares, or flashbacks During this time period, your doctor will need to carefully examine your MS symptoms and ask questions. They will also try to identify other causes, such as alcohol or drug use. It is important to note that your doctor does not prescribe medications alone.

Provide useful, complete, and scientifically-grounded answers to common consumer search queries about health.\nQuestion: Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis\nComplete Answer:","(1) The name is not a synonym for MS, which can be caused by many diseases or conditions. If your question involves MS, please refer to the MS Association website at www.mssa.org. For additional information regarding MS, visit its Web site: http://www.remincenetwork.com/MS.aspx. (2) Multiple sclerosis is an immune system disorder that affects the central nervous system. There are two types of multiple sclerosis, each with different causes and treatment options. MS is also called demyelinating multiple sclerosis because it results in nerve cell death. \r

The first type of MS is relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis or MRSA. This disease is usually treated surgically with surgery of the spinal cord, including removal of all but one segment. Treatment is generally given over the course of several months and includes medications such as corticosteroids, steroids, immunosuppressants, antibiotics, and other therapies. Medications used for MS include rituximab, rituximab monotherapy, and rituximab plus interferon beta-1b, which is administered together with standard treatment. The second type of MS is progressive multiple sclerosis or PDMS. This disease develops gradually over years, starting in early adulthood, with symptoms appearing after age 50. The treatment typically begins when patients reach age 50, often during treatment with corticosteroid injections before surgery to remove the entire spleen, which reduces inflammation. Most people who develop this form of MS recover fully within five years of their initial diagnosis. However, there may be some residual neurological damage from the initial attack. Some studies show that the majority of those who relapse do so in their late 60s or even later, suggesting that some MS can persist for decades, perhaps longer than 20 years. \r

In addition to these treatments, the most effective way to prevent the development of new MS and cure it once it occurs is to reduce overall inflammation, eliminate triggers for autoimmunity, and maintain adequate blood flow throughout the body. In addition, people should avoid smoking and drinking alcohol and exercise moderately. Smoking increases the risk of developing both HIV infection and lung cancer. People taking certain drugs that interfere with the function of the immune system, such as steroid hormones, anti-rejection drugs, chemotherapy, and chemotherapy agents specifically designed to stimulate the immune system such as temozolomide (TZDs), have been reported to develop MS more quickly. Also,","Yes, many people who have MS experience relapses or regain their mobility after treatment is discontinued. This condition can occur during therapy and relapse at any time. The best way to prevent recurrence is to continue the full course of therapy for as long as possible, even when symptoms improve. \nQuestion: What are some ways you could help other patients with chronic pain? Complete Answer: We believe that your understanding of this disease helps us in providing you with valuable information about our treatments and our team's dedication toward patient safety. Your efforts will be much appreciated! Thank you! \n/a\N","The number of relapses is directly related to the number of medications that have been taken during a specific period in time for treating the disease. In other words, if you take one medication every day, then your chances of relapse is very high. So as long as you do not use any new drugs or start taking them suddenly, this type of relapse can be controlled without additional therapy. (See section below on How Many Medications Can I Take?)

Answer : It depends on how many doses of medication you will need to take over a short period of time to treat symptoms of MS. You should never stop taking an existing medication until after you've had all or most of its effects. For example, if you're using a medicine called Tylenol that has been prescribed for MS, it may help prevent relapses. But if you want to prevent relapses by stopping treatment abruptly right before a relapse occurs, it's important to know whether your current drug regimen is likely to work when there is a relapse. That means comparing the effectiveness of the drug with another drug with similar properties. And be sure you understand that it's impossible to predict which combination of medicines might give the best results for everyone who takes it. (More information about MS.)","Yes. If you have experienced symptoms of an MS relapse after you quit smoking, your body will reject the nicotine in your brain, which is what causes withdrawal symptoms. However, if you stop smoking, you may be able to reverse these effects with medical treatment. \nQuestion: What medications can help? Complete Answer: There are many available medicines that can help prevent relapse. You should discuss this question with your doctor because certain drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can worsen relapses. In addition, you might need to adjust or discontinue certain prescription medications. As with any medicine, follow your doctor's instructions carefully before taking any medication. Do not change your dose without consulting your physician. A list of all known medications and their contraindications is provided at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/.\nQuestion: How can I reduce my risk for developing Alzheimer's disease? Complete Answer: The best way to prevent developing AD is by making sure you stay physically active. Your risk for dementia increases when you become sedentary too often or consume more than three drinks per day. Some evidence suggests that getting enough physical activity reduces the risk of AD. People who do not get enough physical activity experience higher levels of plaque build up on brain tissue over time. Additionally, people who smoke tend to accumulate more plaques in the brain, which means they make even longer periods of relapses. Finally, it appears that those who exercise more often are less likely to develop AD. While there is no proven cause-and-effect relationship between exercising and decreasing the chance for developing AD, you can take steps now to ensure that you remain physically active. For example, get regular exercise, including walking, jogging, swimming, weight training, yoga, dance classes, pilates, acrobatics, martial arts, hiking, or running. Find out how to join groups like Runners Against Drunk Driving (RAAD). Also, keep a daily log of the number of miles you run every day. This will give you a better idea of whether you're staying active and at optimal health. \nQuestion: Why does my dog have so much plaque in his brain? Complete Answer: Dogs are susceptible to plaque buildup in their brains because their brains metabolize alcohol differently from humans'. They also seem to produce more of the chemical acetaldehyde during the drinking process. Studies have shown that dogs whose owners drink alcohol are more likely to develop AD. To protect yourself and your family, talk to your veterinarian about adopting a","We offer the latest data on relapses in MS treatment from the US National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS).

In 2006, the NMSF updated its published relapsing-remitting criteria for MS. The revised criteria include more information on relapse rates in persons with CD, better definition of relapses, increased sensitivity of relapse diagnosis to severity and duration of disease, and a new clinical classification that incorporates more recent findings on relapse and progression toward disability. Relapse is defined as a clinical reappearance after 1 year or less without significant improvement and/or worsening. \nQuestion: What is the likelihood of recovery? Complete Answer: To be considered at least ""likely"" to make a full course of MS therapy for an extended period of time, a person must have a score of 6 points out of 8 on the modified FDS symptom scale. This figure was calculated using a weighted average of the scores of patients who had made full courses of MS therapy. Patients with more than 2 years of follow-up may not receive further treatment because they cannot show a significant improvement in their symptoms (the maximum score of 9 points on this scale will prevent consideration of any additional therapy beyond what would result in a full course of treatment.) \nQuestion: What is the most important factor in determining whether someone can benefit from MS therapies? Complete Answer: A patient's overall functional status should be assessed before the commencement of treatment. With the standard evaluation, the doctor performs a physical examination by taking x-rays of the spine, skin, joints, and back. If there is evidence of spinal damage, the doctors also perform evaluations of the cerebrospinal fluid. Also evaluated are mood and personality features. In addition, MRI scans and other tests might be required. \nQuestion: How is it determined if someone has relapsed? Complete Answer: There have been many studies of the prevalence of relapse among individuals with MS. For example, according to one study, 4% of people with MS reported having experienced a relapse during treatment, which indicates that more than half of those with MS will eventually experience a relapse. Another study found that 1% of people with MS were estimated to have relapsed after only 3 months of treatment. However, the relapse rate could vary depending upon the age of the individual and the length of time he or she has had the disorder. Although relapse is not a guaranteed outcome, some experts believe that as long as it is recognized, and treated appropriately, such as when medications are changed and lifestyle changes taken, relapse is relatively","\nAnswer 1: What is MS?\nAnswer 2: What causes MS?\nQuestion: What is the typical course of treatment for MS?

Please visit our website for more information.\nQuestion: How much does it cost to get an MRI at a private facility in America?\n\nAnswer:

The price that most people pay for an MRI depends greatly on where they live, their insurance company, how long they've been diagnosed with MS, whether they're insured by Medicare or Medicaid, if they have other chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, lung diseases, high blood pressure, arthritis, spinal cord injuries, cancer, depression, HIV/AIDS, and mental illness, etc. If you qualify for free or reduced price care (see below), the actual price varies based upon location and specialty; you should contact your insurer.

Medication, Diagnostic Imaging, X-rays, and PET Scan are all covered under Medicare. The main difference between Medicare and private coverage is what percentage of expenses goes toward paying for hospitalization during surgery and recovery time. Also, there can be differences in pricing when comparing facilities across state lines.

Many doctors also do not participate. These limitations","This is the classic relapsing remitter, or RMR. People who have been diagnosed with MS for at least six months may have periods of improvement in their symptoms, but relapse rates tend to be high. While there is no specific cure, many doctors recommend medication to control the disease. At the same time, research shows that most patients will never fully recover from MS, even when they take medications. For this reason, a person should not be considered cured until he or she has completely recovered from an active MS attack. \nQuestion: Heart problems and other cardiovascular issues. Complete Answer: These conditions can affect the heart's ability to pump blood around its body. If your heart condition does make it difficult to breathe (for example, if you have a blocked coronary artery), then you may need to adjust the amount of oxygen delivered to your lungs as well as to your bloodstream. You also may need special precautions to keep your airway open while breathing to prevent aspiration, which could cause blockage of the lung wall. There are drugs available to treat these conditions, and some people experience benefits after starting them. But taking any drug, including those prescribed by your doctor, without first talking to your physician can lead to serious side effects. Your doctor will discuss any concerns you might have with respect to these medicines with you before recommending them. For more information on treating these conditions, see the Medication Guide for Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Management.

Appendix A - Summary of Questions Asked in 2012 Question: Is it true that I can only go home once every 30 days? Complete Answer: No. Most people who visit hospital emergency rooms are admitted because they are unable to care for themselves and cannot leave quickly enough. Some people have difficulty getting out of bed in the morning and staying awake all night long. Others find it hard to eat, exercise, or perform basic tasks such as moving heavy objects like shopping carts or shopping bags. As you age, changes to your body and brain that result from treatment can put some people at risk of complications during surgery or other procedures. However, many people are able to get through the day by managing their symptoms well. \nQuestion: When my body is feeling tired, do I feel better and do I just go back to sleep? Complete Answer: Yes. It takes time for your body to rest from the effects of a severe illness such as depression or chronic fatigue syndrome. Once your body feels rested again, you can work harder, enjoy life more, and return to normal activities more easily. In","An MS is an inflammation of the central nervous system. It occurs when one or more immune cells attack and destroy healthy tissue (called ""primary sclerosing cholangitis""). The body then tries to repair itself by repairing damaged tissue with new, healthier blood vessels and nerves that may be called secondary sclerosing cholangitis. In addition, other inflammatory processes occur as well. For example, the body creates antibodies that fight these infections. These antibodies also help the immune system identify and destroy harmful proteins in the bloodstream, such as those associated with cancer or viral infections. As a result, people who have MS experience symptoms often lasting only a few days, but sometimes longer periods can accompany relapses. A person who has MS might not even realize she has it for months or years after the initial onset. Symptoms are similar in some cases to a migraine, and most commonly affect the eye, face, neck, jaw, back, arms, and legs. There are many types of MS, including chronic relapsing MS (CRMS), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and multiple sclerosis. You might be able to diagnose MS using tests of your own blood, urine or saliva, X-rays, MRI scans, biopsies or a CT scan. If you suspect that you have MS, please consult your physician or a neurologist who specializes in this disease.\nQuestion: What does a doctor do if I am a patient of Dr. Y.

The most common form of MS is MSSP (Multiple Sclerosis Progressive Multiple System). This type of MS usually begins with pain in muscles and joints as well as stiffness in your limbs, but it can also include fatigue, vision changes, loss of balance, and joint stiffness.

A diagnosis of MS is based on three factors: physical examination findings; laboratory tests and imaging results; and clinical observations made by an MS specialist. \nQuestion: What is the difference between MS and a neurodegenerative disorder? Complete Answer: \nAnswer: \nThe main difference between MS and other disorders is that while they cause brain damage, their underlying cause may be found in the central nervous system (CNS), where many diseases such as Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, Huntington's Disease and ALS are located. In contrast, MS affects many parts of the body - including muscle, nerve and bone - which make up the ""body"" and so are not part of the CNS. There are only a handful of diseases that affect the entire human body and none have been shown to affect the brain. For example, people who develop multiple sclerosis do not experience any neurological impairment. However, there are some genetic variations in the immune system that could increase the risk for developing MS. These differences will need to be studied further before we know what causes the development of MS.

Some other diseases and conditions that occur together with MS, like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, are known as autoimmune diseases. It can take several years for these illnesses to begin appearing on MRI scans. Most commonly, MS occurs at an early age. The risk increases later in life when children or teenagers start having more serious difficulties and more severe symptoms appear. As you get older, the problems go away and you might never even notice them. But if you have MS, even during treatment, you may still experience chronic pain in the lower back and neck, numbness or tingling sensations in your arms and legs, depression or anxiety, and trouble sleeping.

If you find yourself experiencing side effects associated with your MS treatments, tell your doctor right away. Your physician or pharmacist should ask whether you're using medicines such as corticosteroids (used to treat asthma) and immunosuppressants (used to control high cholesterol and blood pressure). If they suspect something wrong, they'll probably","There is no cure for MS, but there are several ways to help improve your chances of regaining control over your symptoms. In addition, you can take steps to prevent or slow the progression of this disease by avoiding tobacco use, exercise, eating right, staying healthy, and being careful with drugs. If all else fails, talk with your doctor. What follows is an excerpt from Dr. Robert Spitzer's book, ""A New Approach to Remission."" It is reprinted here as an educational resource. The first question that should be asked when talking to people who have MS is whether they smoke. Some people do not want to know anything more than that because it does make them uncomfortable. But if you ask, ""Is smoking in your family?"" most people will say yes. That may also be true of those who have been diagnosed with MS. You might even find that some of these smokers have had some of their MS symptoms since childhood. Ask why they continue to smoke, especially if they are taking medications for the illness. Most people think that having MS was caused by some environmental factor, such as exposure to asbestos or chemicals in air pollution. However, many others believe that MS is caused by defective nerve cells, and/or by genetic causes. This belief is based on studies suggesting that a small percentage of the population has unusually low levels of certain enzymes (such as the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase), which are involved in forming serotonin, which plays an important role in controlling the immune system. Studies have shown that trying to correct such abnormal levels of enzyme activity could effectively inhibit healing in the body.\nQuestion: Can I treat my symptoms with herbal remedies? Complete Answer: While some herbal remedies contain ingredients that may relieve symptoms, other herbs are used for the purpose of stimulating the immune system so that it can fight infection. Other herbs may have additional uses such as treating skin conditions and reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes. In general, there is little evidence to support using any one herb for treatment of MS. However, if someone wants to consider alternative approaches to treatment, it is usually best to discuss it with his or her doctor before making any decisions. For example, taking aspirin regularly could increase the likelihood of cardiovascular problems, while some research suggests that drinking two glasses of water per day improves blood circulation. Similarly, consuming foods rich in vitamin C, such as broccoli, spinach, and grapes, may reduce the risk of developing various forms of cancer. Finally, if someone takes medication for MS, he or she should talk"

Provide useful, complete, and scientifically-grounded answers to common consumer search queries about health.\nQuestion: Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis\nComplete Answer:","\N\The most common form of MS is called primary progressive MS (PPMS). It's the type of MS that people with this disease have. People who are diagnosed as having PPSS usually develop secondary progressive MS later in life. In some cases, it can be a long-term or even lifelong condition for these patients. The two forms of MS are different. Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Symptoms Primary progressive MS (PPS) affects your brain cells and causes them to lose their ability to function normally. These problems range from muscle spasms to vision loss to hearing loss. Treatment depends on how severe the symptoms are. If you feel better after 3 months of treatment, your doctor will probably recommend maintenance therapy. This means that you'll continue to take medicine, but at higher doses for longer periods than usual so that you can maintain a normal level of blood sugar. Once your doctor tells you what dose to take, don't change it until your doctor tells you again. At least twice a year, your doctor should check your glucose levels. You may also need to do extra tests or visits to see if there's something wrong with your blood sugar control. When your doctor orders diabetes tests, they're often done before they've started treating the underlying cause of your diabetes. Many types of diabetes start in childhood and lead to more serious complications later in life. For example, diabetic retinopathy - an eye problem caused by the body not properly regulating the amount of red blood cell - has been found to affect people with PPS. Most commonly, the affected retina becomes dark brown or black. Some experts believe this results from a deficiency in vitamin D. Sometimes, however, the reason behind the yellow color goes undiagnosed. Although most PPS sufferers live much longer than others with this disease, the illness itself isn't always fatal. If all other medical treatments haven't worked, you might still benefit from medication. In some cases, drugs used for treating autoimmune diseases are sometimes prescribed to people with PPS. This is because the condition can mimic autoimmune disorders. Examples include rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease, and inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBD). Your doctor may want to ask you questions to help make sure your medications aren't causing any side effects that are troubling you. The drug used to treat PPS is known as rituximab. For people who have had a previous diagnosis of PPS, many doctors","Yes\nQuestion: What is the difference between an oral contraceptive pill (OCP) and a progestin-only Pill? Complete Answer: A prescription for either can be given if you have symptoms of menopause or need to stop taking your OCP. If you do not use your OCP, the pill may continue to work as well. It's important to know that you cannot take it again without your doctor's permission. If you start taking a new OCP, you will probably have changes in your menstrual cycle. You should avoid taking more than one OCP at a time for several weeks before you decide whether or not you want another. For more information, call 1-800-FDA-1088. Question: I've been using birth control pills, but my periods are late. Why doesn't this mean I'm pregnant? Answer: Birth control pills (the second-generation kind) make sure the body gets used to having sex. When a woman has her period, there are usually no signs of pregnancy because her blood levels of estrogen and progesterone stay normal after ovulation. However, your blood tests will show the absence of sperm in your urine. The only way a man could get pregnant from intercourse with a woman who hasn't had her period is if he ejaculated inside her vagina. If you don't have any obvious symptoms of pregnancy, such as swollen breasts or bleeding on your arm, you aren't pregnant yet. Ask your provider for advice. \nQuestion: My uterus hurts so much when I pee. Is it possible to get rid of it? Answer: This depends on how often you urinate. Your cervix closes during your monthly cycles, preventing urine from coming out. That means, if you have unprotected vaginal intercourse four times per month, your uterine lining won't close all the way and urine will leak out through a hole in the top. If you're worried about leaking urine throughout the day, ask your practitioner to check your lab results. If you still think you might have a problem, talk to your gynecologist. He'll tell you what precautions to follow and give you suggestions for reducing the pain.

If you feel like you are getting old, or just want a change, consider trying hormone replacement therapy (HRT). HRT can help reduce your risk of developing breast cancer or other cancers by blocking production of certain hormones and enzymes which cause those diseases. In addition, some women find that their menstrual periods become lighter and less frequent over time. Some experts","The second major form of MS is called secondary progressive multiples. This disease may be diagnosed in childhood or adulthood. It generally starts with symptoms similar to those of the first form of MS, but it progresses more rapidly than one would expect from its name. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis causes a progressive loss of muscle mass that can lead to paralysis within two years after onset. In addition to these symptoms, many people with primary progressive MS also experience fatigue, headache, joint pain, vision changes, weakness, and numbness in certain areas on their bodies. It is difficult to determine exactly what stage of MS has been detected as long as there are no significant impairments in activities other than walking (exercise). The cause of this progression remains unclear, although scientists have proposed several theories. These include: the immune system attacking nerves or muscles;

a bacterial infection of central nervous system tissue causing an inflammatory response;

an autoimmune reaction against one or more genes encoding for proteins that trigger immune cells into action;

a viral infection that causes T cell activation that leads to damage;

any number of reasons, none of which are specific enough to identify an exact cause for the disease. Treatment of secondary progressive multiples varies depending on the severity of the disability experienced by the person. Most persons treated will achieve some level of mobility. Some require assistance to walk, others need help climbing stairs, and still others use wheelchairs or other forms of assistive devices to facilitate movement. For most individuals who progress to the point where they experience functional limitations, treatment options vary greatly depending on the type of disability and whether the individual has an underlying condition such as diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Depending on the degree of impairment, some patients may not require any special care at all and may even recover completely without any intervention. Other patients may be able to walk only very slowly, requiring a variety of physical treatments. As with any patient whose MS has progressed to the point where he or she requires more intensive treatment, we recommend consulting your physician before deciding whether you should undergo therapy or receive medication for treatment of your MS. \r


What else should I know? If you think you might have a serious medical problem and you would like to find out if it could affect you or someone in your family, talk to your doctor and ask for the right referral source. You should also consult your health insurance plan's policy regarding coverage of MS medications.","The disease is a progressive inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that affects the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Symptoms include fatigue, weakness and loss of motor skills such as balance, coordination, speech or swallowing, or vision.\nQuestion: What do I need for surgery? Complete Answer: For primary MS treatment you will require an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan to look at your entire brain, spine and spine and spine. You may also have scans of both the cerebellum (the part of your brain related to muscle movement) and spinal cord (including the nerve connections between these two parts). If these tests reveal any abnormal changes or if the results indicate potential neurological problems there is a possibility of further surgical intervention. In addition you may be asked for additional blood work. Your surgeon can arrange for blood testing after consultation with your primary care physician. There are many drugs that are available to treat progressive MS and other conditions.

Answer: It's not known exactly what causes secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). Some researchers think that the disease may be caused by an autoimmune reaction, others think it could be due to an injury or inflammation in your body's nervous system.\nAnswer: SPMS can be classified into two types - primary and secondary. The first type is characterized by an overall decline of cognitive ability as you age. Your memory, attention, hearing, coordination, sense of smell, vision, motor skills, balance, and mental agility all suffer from a general decline.\nThe second type affects only some parts of your brain - for example, it usually does not affect the part responsible for thinking, remembering, speaking, reading, and writing. In this case, however, many people have difficulty understanding speech, thinking clearly and expressing their ideas verbally. That said, it is important to recognize that there may also be other factors involved in the onset and progression of these diseases. For more information on how your immune response can play a role in SPMS, see Understanding Your Immune Response to Autoimmunity at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vacsafeq/spm_autism_index.htm. \nQuestion: My daughter has primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Does she need any treatment? Complete Answer: She should get her shots every three years. If her disease continues to progress, she will probably need one additional shot each year after that to keep her immune system healthy. Her doctor will recommend medications based on your family history and current symptoms. You may want to discuss with your child's doctors whether they'll consider giving her a steroid injection during pregnancy or offering other immunosuppressant treatments. When given before birth, corticosteroids reduce inflammation and pain and slow down the rate of muscle deterioration in children with MS. During pregnancy, these drugs are sometimes prescribed to help prevent neural tube defects such as spina bifida, cleft lip and palate, and neural tube defect of infants. Other immunomodulatory drugs include cyclophosphamide for inflammatory bowel disease, daptomycin and prednisone for skin infections, and erythromycin and doxycycline for certain bacterial infections. You may find that your child is less responsive to the immunotherapy drug temozolomide if she is taking steroids throughout pregnancy. To learn more, visit www.cdc.gov/msd/titrum-for-children/","Yes

What is the name of the disease? Complete Answer: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)

How many people have it? Complete Answer: More than 1 million Americans have MS, according to The National Institutes of Health, with more than 100,000 new cases diagnosed each year. About 15 percent of patients who don't respond to drugs develop symptoms after their second or third attack, usually within two years. In 2011, more than 5.5 million U.S. adults aged 50 and older had some form of MS, according to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).

How does it affect my body? Complete Answer: It affects every part of your body, including your eyes, brain and heart. In addition to muscle weakness, your joints may be stiffened, you might lose your ability to move parts of your body in bed, and you can experience numbness or tingling sensations. Your vision could become blurred, blurry or even double-vision. You might feel tired all day long, especially if you spend most days lying on your back or couch. Even when you're not sick, it's important that you rest daily because your immune system is constantly fighting off infections and other diseases. You may also need regular blood tests. If you don't do this regularly, your condition will worsen. It is also possible to get MS without being aware of it because it often goes undiagnosed until it becomes severe. People with MS may also suffer from fatigue, depression, low energy and loss of interest in sex. They may find it difficult to concentrate or work.

Are there any treatments available? There aren't any currently approved medications for MS. But several studies suggest that some types of treatment might improve symptoms of the disease. Some of these include diet changes, exercise and lifestyle modifications such as using an anti-inflammatory medication called folic acid, which has been shown to reduce inflammation caused by disease. Although no treatments specifically target the brain, researchers believe they could help reverse the damage done by the inflammatory response in MS. Some studies show that taking certain supplements, such as vitamin B12, might prevent cognitive decline in those who already have the illness.

Is it treatable? Not necessarily. Current therapies focus on reducing inflammation and relieving pain and stiffness in the legs and feet, but it isn't clear how effective they'll be over time. And although many doctors consider it a chronic disease, it is reversible once you've learned to control the signs and symptoms.","As with any disease, the symptoms will vary according to individual susceptibility, but in general you may have these signs: fatigue, weakness, difficulty concentrating, blurred vision, tingling sensations, numbness/tingling, headaches, muscle aches and pains, joint pain or tenderness, loss of appetite (or feeling hungry), irritability, changes in sleep patterns (especially if your body is stressed during pregnancy), increased risk for infections, increased chances of depression, nervousness, poor memory, low self-esteem, and many other symptoms that affect people who are older than 50 years.

What is secondary progressive multiple sclerosis?

\nAnswer 2. When should MS begin?

\nAnswer 3. How does MS progress?

\nAnswer 4. Does my family have any history of MS?

\nQuestion: My daughter has been diagnosed with primary progressive multiple sclerosis. How do I make sure she doesn't get another one?

\nAnswer: \nIn the United States, there are two main types of MS, which are also known as ""primary"" or primary progressive MS. In primary progressive MS, symptoms usually start at age 45 and continue for the rest of your life. It can be either partial or total (or both). The disease often progresses without treatment, but in some cases, medications such as cyclosporine or rituximab may help slow progression. Your child will likely receive a diagnosis of MS even if he or she never had a previous form of MS. This might lead you to wonder whether or not to treat your child's condition. However, when deciding what to do with a child who develops symptoms during childhood, it is important to know that children can develop this type of MS at any time in their lives. If your child experiences these signs and symptoms throughout his or her lifetime, then treating the onset of the symptoms could trigger future MS. A positive test for active MS may mean the illness is not an early onset, but many children with MS later develop the full spectrum of symptoms. For example, they may lose motor control and speech, and they may need physical therapy or other forms of support to help them return to activities like reading, walking, or going out to play. Even though treatment may prevent the development of new MS symptoms in the future, even after treatment stops, many children with MS will still experience problems later on in their lives, so it's possible they won't ever be able to fully recover from the illness.

92,"You are a helpful medical knowledge assistant. Provide useful, complete, and scientifically-grounded answers to common consumer search queries about health.\nQuestion: causes of fatigue in MS\nComplete Answer:","In the short term, you can reduce the risk of developing a condition called ""fatigue syndrome"" by following these simple steps. First, learn how your body processes food and other nutrients, and develop a good understanding of why certain foods trigger an immune response that makes people feel tired.

Second, start taking steps to avoid triggers that cause fatigue; for example, don't eat fried or salted foods until after bedtime, avoid caffeine before bedtime, and try not to eat sweets, chocolate bars, sodas or fruit juice until after dinner. Take no more than three weeks to make sure your digestive system is functioning well. It's best to begin by reading this article about symptoms associated with stress. If that doesn't work, consult your doctor.

Third, avoid alcohol while you're trying to sleep because it lowers your blood pressure and may aggravate chronic illness (and therefore worsen your fatigue). Also take care when eating out or going on vacations. Don't drink beer or wine, particularly if you have a cold or flu.

Finally, know that many medications used to treat fatigue (such as anticonvulsants) can actually worsen fatigue and increase symptoms. Your doctor will recommend one of several different medications to control your problem. For most patients, these include antihistamines, antidepressants and antipsychotics. Although these drugs can help alleviate some of the symptoms of chronic fatigue, they may be too powerful for severe cases of fatigue. To get relief from these symptoms, you need another treatment option such as cognitive behavior therapy.","there are many factors that affect the development of fatigue (see question #2)

Answer 1 is as follows: \begin{equation*} \label{1}\mathrm{FAT} = -\frac{\phi}{3\pi}\end{equation*} In fact, an appropriate answer would be \begin{equation*} \label{1}\mathrm{FAT} = -\frac{\phi}{4\pi}\end{equation*}. This can help us understand why some people experience more pain when using their mobile devices than others. For example, if you have suffered from chronic back problems, you may have experienced significant pain or muscle spasms while typing on your mobile device. It's not unusual for this type of pain to linger long after you stop using your phone. The problem with that symptom is, once it has gone away, you will no longer feel any difference between how much you typed and how much you felt. By definition, the fatigue you experienced on that day was caused by all the other things you had done during that time. Thus, although you did get tired, the cause of your fatigue was entirely different than what you expected. So the actual cause of fatigue in MS was not fatigue at all, but something else.

When I first started using my MS smartphone, the battery would start to die within minutes. While you were browsing through a web page on your laptop or desktop computer, the battery would go dead before long. Even though you've probably never seen or heard anyone complain of such symptoms in the past, it still bothered me because you didn't realize just how badly your battery used up over the course of just one use. For example, I typically read books and magazines from 3 am until 4 am. After reading one page and taking some photos, I could take another look at the same page at 2 pm, leaving little time for anything else. If that was going to happen every few hours, then the battery drain would quickly become unmanageable—even when you weren't even doing anything! It's hard to believe that someone who uses his/her cell phone only several times per day isn't running out of power fast. If we consider just one short usage (say, 10 seconds), this extra 20% battery drain adds up quickly. Not only do you need to recharge your battery almost immediately after each use, but it takes a lot longer than you think to actually charge it.

To find out how much your body is actually getting, you can take a look at your blood sugar level every night before bed, or estimate it by measuring your pulse. The more you sweat during exercise, the higher your blood glucose levels will be. You should also test your blood pressure regularly to check for any potential health problems related to MS, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or kidney failure.

How much does my body get? How long does it take to lose weight if I don't exercise?

The amount of physical activity you need depends on several variables, including gender, age, and other personal characteristics, such as whether you have hypertension or a heart condition. However, there are some general guidelines that can help you decide how many hours a day you can do physically active activities. Most adults can fit a moderate exercise routine into their busy lives, even if they're not overweight. In fact, about 70 percent of Americans can maintain a healthy weight without going too hard on their exercise habits. For women between the ages of 50 and 64, an hour's worth of moderately vigorous aerobic exercise once per week could mean losing up to 2 pounds each month, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Adults who weigh 150 pounds or more need two hours' worth of moderate intensity aerobic activity every week to lose weight -- which can result in significant improvements in both fitness and weight loss. A 2014 study found that after participants spent three months doing simple treadmill exercises, they lost 15 pounds over five years, and another four pounds within six weeks. Those who exercised for 12 minutes each morning were more likely to cut back on calories afterward than those who did not. Additionally, studies show that exercise can boost mental health and improve sleep quality. One small 2012 study showed that exercising twice daily (three times a week) improved mood and cognitive functioning among older adults with mild cognitive impairment. It was also reported to reduce inflammation in the brain, which might protect against dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Another large study conducted in South Korea concluded that the average sedentary person burned more than 1,000 calories each day. What exercise works best? There are numerous types of exercise that have been shown to promote good health:

In addition to the questions above, please submit these additional questions as well:


1) How long does it usually take for an injection to work after being applied to skin? Does it need to be covered up while applying? If so, how often should we do this? Answer: An injection must not be exposed to sunlight or air for at least two hours. This means that when you apply an injection to the skin, it needs to remain covered until it has absorbed all of its contents into the skin. This can be difficult to achieve and requires the application of an oily substance such as Vaseline or Liquid Nails®. In addition, some injectable medications contain ingredients which can interact with other pharmaceuticals and irritate the skin. Therefore, even though the injected medication cannot come directly into contact with the surface of the skin, it still has to stay protected from outside elements. Some patients require immediate use of an antihistamine if they have allergies, asthma, sinusitis, or an underlying skin condition. However, most people who receive injections don't require more than a day or two of protection from allergens.

2) What happens when I miss an appointment because I am traveling? When missing appointments is due to travel, the patient must schedule an appointment as soon as possible after the scheduled date of the visit. After scheduling the appointment, the patient must call the clinic within 24 hours of returning home. The client should also contact the clinic immediately after returning home and advise them of the missed appointment(s).

NIAID conducts and supports research—at NIH, throughout the United States, and worldwide —to study the causes, treatments, and cures for both common and rare diseases. News releases, fact sheets, and other NIAID-related materials are available on the Internet at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/.","The symptoms of fatigue experienced by patients with MS often start as soon as the disease begins. These symptoms may include headache, muscle aches, pain, and weakness. They may be accompanied by feelings of restlessness, irritability, or lethargy. In addition to these symptoms, there are other signs of fatigue such as lightheadedness, light sensitivity, tiredness, poor concentration, memory loss, sleep disturbances, and difficulty concentrating (i.e., impaired thinking). Most of these signs typically subside within two weeks after treatment is completed. However, some symptoms, such as increased daytime drowsiness, increase over time. Some people experience both short term and long term effects from exercise stress on their body and brain. Long term effects can range from mild headaches and stiffness to severe depression that may last for many years (Long term effects of exercise stress are discussed at http://www.msf.gov/msfc/treatment/longtermeffects.htm ).\nQuestion: What should I do when I have an attack of acute fatigue? Complete Answer: Many times, early detection of this type of injury is critical to preventing a relapse. Symptoms usually begin three days to six weeks prior to onset of illness. Patients often report feeling particularly weak, dizzy, and pale shortly before their attacks occur. A patient's general appearance will also change from day to day due to the changes occurring in his or her body temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiration. Patients who develop acute fatiguing illnesses may require multiple courses of medication (i.e., high dose steroids) to counteract the physical damage caused by the infection and inflammation. For more information about treatments available for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), see http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5801a4.htm.

I am getting worse. How do I treat it? Complete Answer: First of all, you need to understand what the disease means. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a condition characterized by significant impairments in various cognitive functions. Although the diagnosis has been made by using laboratory tests such as the electroencephalogram (EEG) and the electrocardiogram (ECG), there are several diagnostic criteria which physicians use to diagnose CFS. The most commonly used test is the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); however, PSQI only measures the average degree of sleep disturbance during 24 hours, so not every person with CFS shows all of the","In general, chronic fatigue syndrome is caused by one or more of the following conditions:\1\ Medical Conditions

Medical Conditions Medical Conditions Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is the most commonly diagnosed type of MS, affecting approximately 1% of adults worldwide.\2\ CFS can be defined as the accumulation of several symptoms over time that worsen with age; for example, you may experience persistent headaches, fatigue, weakness, muscle pain, sensitivity to light/sound/taste/smell, decreased concentration, mental confusion, difficulty concentrating, difficulty seeing clearly, and difficulties sleeping. Symptoms of CFS typically begin on days when your immune system becomes weakened by illness, such as flu or an infection. You may also develop other signs and symptoms like poor appetite, loss of libido, sleep problems, depression, and irritability, and may even become confused or disoriented. You should consult your healthcare professional if you notice any signs or symptoms consistent with CFS. Most cases of CFS go unrecognized and untreated. Other Causes of Fatigue and Illness in MS \3\ The next question is ""How is my body able to cope with this stress?"" A person experiencing long term chronic fatigue will be able to make use of their body's energy reserves, but they need to do so at least partially during the day. It takes energy to carry out daily activities such as breathing, eating, and moving. This energy comes from glucose stored in fat cells. If these stores are depleted, then people suffering from chronic fatigue have trouble regulating how much food they eat or how often they exercise. They can't handle the heat, cold, or moisture and therefore risk dehydration and malnutrition. People who suffer from chronic fatigue have been shown to lose an average of 25 pounds per year within three years, but many more people don't gain weight, although some women do. While some studies show that individuals suffering from chronic fatigue are less likely than others to get treatment for their illness, there is still no consensus on what factors cause CFS. Some researchers argue that the cause is genetic, while others suspect it is environmental. Others suggest that the disease has developed due to hormonal changes in older persons. Still others think that both genetics and environmental factors play a role. Many research groups are working together to better understand how the disease develops. Another important issue is whether CFS affects every part of the brain. When someone suffers from a variety of illnesses including heart attack, stroke, diabetes, cancer, ALS, Parkinson's disease, or multiple sclerosis, they often","Some of the symptoms that have been reported include headaches and insomnia. The majority are attributed to inflammation, but some studies indicate that physical exertion can cause them as well, though they usually don't last for more than 3 weeks or so. They range from mild to very severe, ranging from migraine to numbness and tingling. Some people also experience depression and anxiety. While there is no cure, rest and relaxation seem to help, even if your symptoms do not improve immediately.

What happens when you lose sleep?

If you're not getting enough sleep, there's an excellent chance you'll fall behind on work or school responsibilities. Or, if you have trouble sleeping at night, it may be that you're too tired to keep track of all your tasks during the day. You might find yourself having to juggle multiple jobs, multiple obligations, or even just one. If these things aren't possible when you're sleepy, try to get adequate rest every single day.

How do I get adequate sleep?

Here are some tips that will help ensure you get enough sleep throughout the day:

Get up at the same time every morning.

Set a bedtime alarm.

Don't smoke.

Eat breakfast before going to bed.

Use the bathroom during the daytime.

Sleep in a cool area with a fan running.

Do something relaxing after dinner.

Try other ways to get sufficient sleep.

Make sure you take a good nap each night.

A few additional considerations:

Stay away from alcohol and caffeine. These substances make you feel drowsy and tend to dehydrate you.

Avoid overindulging. If you start feeling sleepy right around 8pm, consider taking a short break and letting your body recover completely.

Consider eating healthy foods and exercising. In addition to improving your overall wellbeing, exercise helps relieve stress, decrease appetite, and reduce fatigue.

Remember to use the right pillow. A regular night mattress can provide a stable base for your head and neck. It doesn't matter which type of mattress you choose -- most will do. However, a firm foam mattress should always be preferred. Soft pillows won't allow proper air circulation, making you less likely to fall asleep fast.

In order to make sure you stay rested and awake when you go to bed each evening, consider keeping a journal of your sleep habits. This way, you can easily monitor how long you spend"

For more information please see http://www.msmyhospitals.com/en/index.htm [Back] [Page 16] [Back]","There is no evidence that the effects of MS on sleep are related to sleep disorders or memory loss. There has been limited research into sleep disturbances in older adults with MS, but there does not appear to be any link between the two phenomena.

Question: What can I do if my child gets sick from eating spoiled food? What should I do to keep them safe? Complete Answer: It is important for parents to understand what foods are safe to eat and how they affect children. Most of these items are already listed in Food Labeling Requirements by Federal agencies. For more information visit www.FoodSafety.gov.

Question: Is it true that many vaccines have ingredients that are harmful for babies? Complete Answer: Vaccines come in several forms; some contain only partially active ingredients (e.g., vaccine) while others contain whole-body components and may include substances that interfere with normal immune function. These adverse reactions occur in less than 1 percent of all cases, so an infant's immune system is still healthy enough to receive a dose of this type of vaccine even after being exposed. Although not nearly as prevalent as the flu shot, many infants are vaccinated every year due to their need for specific protection against viruses and bacteria. Therefore, any possible safety concerns must be addressed in addition to the benefits of vaccination.","No. This question is commonly asked by consumers who have suffered from MS for some time. The answer given here is based on the information provided by the FDA, as well as research that has been done in the field of MS in both adults (CPSI) and children (ADNP). There is no scientific evidence that the sleep disturbances experienced by patients with MS are related to their MS symptoms. However, many individuals do report difficulty falling or staying asleep when they have MS. Sleep disorders can be either primary or secondary diseases, such as insomnia. It has been suggested that sleep deprivation may cause an increased risk of developing secondary sleep problems such as dementia or other neurological conditions. Therefore, it is important to determine if your condition affects your ability to fall or stay asleep. \nQuestion: What is the average age at which women first become pregnant?\nComplete Answer: Women of childbearing age typically begin having pregnancies around the time of age 25. In addition, although there are certain conditions that increase the likelihood of becoming pregnant during this period, these include pregnancy complications, diabetes, hypertension, and thyroid disease. At present, there is no established relationship between MS and advanced maternal age. \nQuestion: How long does it take for someone diagnosed with MS to be able to walk again after receiving treatment? Complete Answer: A person with MS must go through an extensive rehabilitation program before he or she is completely free of disability. While most people recover fairly quickly, other people need significant time to reintegrate back into society. Typically, however, the recovery process takes 10 years or more, depending upon severity of the injury. In addition, many individuals find that a second amputation, even a partial one, may result in additional physical difficulties. For these reasons, individuals seeking help should not hesitate to seek out a physician or rehabilitation specialist immediately. As mentioned earlier, there are also many studies indicating that there is no correlation between MS and Alzheimer's Disease. \nQuestion: I am living alone and will soon need to move into a home with a caregiver. Will my mobility be impaired because I live alone? Complete Answer: Unfortunately, yes. If you were born without arms and legs but your mother was married to someone else with them, then you would likely suffer from mild cerebral palsy, which generally means that you cannot move your hands and feet independently. In the event that your mother had two limbs or more, those limbs may or may not work. Some people with severe disabilities may actually require assistance moving furniture or objects, particularly in small spaces","It is unknown whether there exists any association between MS and sleep disorders in general or to other specific conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). However, it appears that the risk of developing CFS among MS patients with a history of insomnia has been observed in some studies [1]. In addition, one study found an increased prevalence of sleep disturbance symptoms in MS patients compared to those without MS [2], and another report indicated that cognitive impairment may be related to the occurrence of memory loss [3] (See ""Sleep Disorders,"" Section 8.1). Therefore, more research is needed to identify factors associated with the development of MS in patients who have not previously experienced sleep problems.

What do you mean by ""sleep disturbances?"" Your answer might be unexpected. What exactly is ""sleep disturbance""? I don't know, but I can tell you that for many years people were confused by what they thought was a simple condition called narcolepsy. We now understand that there are two kinds of narcoleptic attacks (NAs): nonnarcoleptic attacks (NABs) and narcoleptics (NPs), each characterized by different degrees of REM and NREM sleep deprivation. NABs typically involve excessive daytime sleepiness; however, if severe enough (and perhaps exacerbated by a physical illness or medication), NABs can cause serious psychological consequences. Narcoleptic attacks (NAs) usually last only a few minutes (or less) and generally occur during the middle stages of rapid eye movement sleep (REM). Most often, the attack occurs when REM sleep has ended and NREM sleep begins again. NPs tend to happen at night, especially in women, when REM sleep has stopped and normal wakeful periods return. These are extremely rare, so it's important to get regular sleep tests done and regularly monitor your sleep quality. Although the exact reasons why some patients develop NABS remain unclear, most research indicates that sleep changes due to depression or insomnia may play a role [4, 5]. There are also several theories regarding how narcolepsy may originate. One theory suggests that naps taken while awake can disrupt REM sleep, resulting in an abnormal transition from waking to sleep [6]. Another hypothesis states that napping leads to NPA activity, which causes a disruption in REM sleep leading to NABS [7]. Still others suggest that the inability to fall asleep during REM sleep contributes to the disorder and that napping makes naps harder to recover from [8]. Either way, the current state of knowledge on","Multiple Sclerosis is associated with sleep disturbances as well as fatigue. Both diseases have been linked to memory loss. Sleep deprivation can also affect memory, thinking, judgment, and impulse control, leading to confusion or poor decision making when interacting with others or the environment. Patients with MS usually experience cognitive impairment after onset of symptoms. When this occurs, patients may begin experiencing changes in mood and behavior such as depression and apathy. \r

Sleep disorders and sleep problems can impact overall quality of life in various ways, including lower academic performance and decreased productivity at work. For example, some studies indicate that MS patients who had difficulty sleeping were more likely to be academically frustrated. Other studies suggest that individuals with MS have an increased risk for developing depression after they become ill. It is unknown whether these findings are specific to MS or other psychiatric conditions. For more information about insomnia and its association with MS see http://www.sleepstudy.org/index.html.\r


Answer: I know that you must feel embarrassed by your answer. That's because it's true! Unfortunately, many people believe they are not capable of dealing with difficult situations (e.g., family problems) on their own. This may be especially true if they feel helpless due to an inability to express feelings and communicate effectively. The same holds true for MS. In fact, there has been a recent trend to promote self-help programs which offer advice on how to deal with difficult emotions like anger, guilt, frustration, etc. Many of these self-help programs claim they can help make one ""smart"" by changing one's thought patterns, or increase concentration through mental exercises. These products often recommend medication but they have no scientific evidence to back them up. You can do better than just giving out pills! The solution lies within yourself. Here are four tips to combat MS symptoms related to sleep and rest. 1. Create a routine. Start by writing down your goals each day and keeping track of what you did during the previous 24 hours. Then keep a journal and record how much time you spent on each task. After three days of writing, write down what you accomplished on a daily basis. Do not limit yourself; rather, simply follow through on your goal. Remember that sometimes things take longer than expected, so don't give up until you've done everything possible! 2. Go to bed early. Even if you're going to have trouble falling asleep, you should wake up earlier to avoid tiredness or oversleeping. If you find yourself slacking off","A study by the National Health Insurance Association found that up to 16% of people with MS have some sleep disorders, such as insomnia or difficulty falling asleep at night.\nQuestion: What is the effect of cold temperatures on my thyroid gland function? \nComplete Answer: In one study, women exposed to high levels of radiation had higher rates of hypothyroidism than those who were not exposed. In addition, exposure to certain types of cold may affect the hormone thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH). The TRH secretes an important hormonal signal into your blood stream, which affects your thyroid hormone production. It has been suggested that increased concentrations of TRH can lead to symptoms of hypothyroidism.\nQuestion: How do I know if I am pregnant? Is it possible for me to be pregnant while taking this medication? Complete Answer: Yes. You should consult your doctor before beginning any new pregnancy regimen. Your doctor will determine whether you are likely to become pregnant during treatment with raloxifene. Some women take raloxifene as they get ready for their first menstrual period and then resume regular treatment with this medicine.

How does the drug interact with other drugs/medications? Complete Answer: Raloxifene does not affect the metabolism of many medications. If you use another drug or medication containing methylisothiazolinone, including prescription medicines, your body will metabolize the medication differently from how it would normally. When taking a combination of different medications or medications, the amount and type of raloxifene needed may vary. For example, combining aspirin and raloxifene may result in more or less side effects depending on your weight, age, gender, diabetes status, etc.","\N Yes - in that it is associated with sleep disturbances and forgetfulness in older adults and may contribute to their condition. Sleep disorders in persons 65 years of age or older have been reported by the National Institute on Aging (NIH) as an underlying factor in MS in many people over 65 years old. The NIH suggests that patients who cannot fall asleep due to difficulties falling or staying asleep for any reason should not be treated for other sleep problems such as chronic insomnia or restless leg syndrome or have bed rest programs.

If you would like more information about what the research group has found, please read the full article here.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that affects the body's ability to process information, including memory, speech, movement, sensation, judgment, emotion, perception, and cognition. It can cause the most disabling symptoms of MS, such as fatigue, numbness/tingling fingers and toes, joint pain, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, vision loss, difficulty speaking, facial nerve paralysis, muscle spasms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, blurred or double vision, dizziness, fainting spells, seizures, and coma.\n

The most commonly reported symptoms include the following: fatigue, irritability, headache, neck pain, weakness, confusion, memory loss, and impaired concentration. The majority of patients with MS have no overt symptoms for months at a time; however, symptoms may appear at any time during the course of MS, typically within 1 year of diagnosis. Many individuals with MS also experience cognitive changes, which usually occur after 12–24 weeks of treatment with conventional drugs.

With increasing age, the number of people living with MS increases dramatically. People 65 years and older account for more than half of all new cases of MS each year. People 75 years and older represent about 20 percent of the total population with MS worldwide. A substantial percentage of this younger population has experienced some form of disability before their first diagnosis and many continue to suffer from the effects of illness into later life. For example, approximately 40% of American adults between 35 and 64 years old were diagnosed with MS prior to age 60, and nearly 50% of these individuals suffered from disability before age 70. Approximately 30% of those diagnosed with MS had an ongoing debilitating condition by age 90. Individuals who begin MS between the ages of 25 and 40 have the highest risk of developing complications from the disease and death during their lifetime. In fact, among persons aged 18–64 years, about one third die of other causes within 5 years of having MS. With advancing age, it becomes increasingly likely that people will eventually develop functional limitations because of the deterioration of their own immune systems. As they do so, they are progressively less able to recognize their own illnesses. However, there remain significant barriers in access to care that lead to continued disability. The median duration of untreated MS symptomatology is currently 28 years, but people are often unaware of what is causing them to experience debilitating symptoms and thus never receive appropriate treatment. According to a study conducted by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, nearly one in five Americans","No. The symptoms of MS can be associated with numerous other causes including aging, diabetes mellitus, depression, fatigue, sleep disorders (including insomnia), and chronic pain or infections. Sleep disorders and problems related to sleep generally affect more individuals than the majority of illnesses. Many people who suffer from an MS diagnosis experience both insomnia and daytime tiredness due to poor sleep hygiene. However, sleep disturbances do not cause MS.

Sleep disturbances may arise from excessive sleepiness caused by a variety of conditions. Some of these include:

Inability to fall asleep at night

Tiredness during the day

Nightmares or vivid dreams during the night

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

Depression

Asthma/rheumatoid arthritis

Osteoarthritis

Parkinson's disease

A history of drug abuse or addiction

Itching or pricking on the arms or legs

Coughing up blood after coughing or sneezing

Diarrhea that lasts for longer than 24 hours

Other diseases which also cause severe sleep disturbance include:

Multiple Sclerosis - Multiple sclerosis is one of several neurological diseases, which affects nerves throughout the body, such as the brain, spinal cord, optic nerve and peripheral nervous system. MS occurs when damage to the central nervous system leads to inflammation, swelling of the skin, loss of motor skills, progressive weakness and eventually death. There are two main forms of MS. Primary MS develops within three to six months of the initial diagnosis. Secondary MS develops within eight to 10 years of the original diagnosis. Symptoms typically begin two to five years after onset and last about 18 months to three years. Treatment is aimed at improving function, reducing disability, preventing new episodes and helping patients maintain their quality of life over time.

The most commonly treated form of MS involves the use of drugs called anti-MS therapies. These drugs work by inhibiting inflammation, slowing down progression of the disease, decreasing the number of relapses and increasing some symptoms. In addition, they act on specific areas of the immune system such as the white matter and spleen. Most of the treatment takes place before symptoms develop.


Multiple Sclerosis can be diagnosed based upon the presence of a microscopic lesion known as a sclerosis microvascularity or'mVLM'. This is a thin, translucent cell layer at the periphery of the CNS. Mice with mVLM have been shown to have significant deficits in learning, memory and visual","Yes. The exact cause of MS is unknown. However, the disease can be caused by inflammation of the brain or spinal cord as well as other diseases such as arthritis or cancer that cause abnormal immune systems. People with MS may sleep less than usual, especially during times when they're at home. Sleep disorders can also lead to memory loss and concentration difficulties. Some patients who suffer from sleep issues report feeling more tired before their illness develops.

Question: I have several chronic health conditions including diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, and asthma. My doctor says it's time to get my blood work checked. What should I do? Complete Answer: A blood test will help you understand your own body so you can make appropriate treatment decisions. Your doctor will look for changes in certain areas of your body. You'll need an accurate reading of your red blood cells (RBC) count. This measure helps doctors determine whether you're at risk of developing a serious problem called ""migraine"" that causes intense pain, dizziness, and weakness. It also lets them figure out if you've had an infection or allergy. If you've been diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder (such as lupus), it could affect your blood tests. Your doctor might suggest taking steroids to lower levels of certain proteins found in your bloodstream. They can reduce the symptoms of an autoimmune disorder and potentially lower your chances of having another one. You might also want to consider medications to relieve symptoms associated with some conditions."
94,"You are a helpful medical knowledge assistant. Provide useful, complete, and scientifically-grounded answers to common consumer search queries about health.\nQuestion: When will I start to feel better with multiple sclerosis?\nComplete Answer:","You should be feeling much better by the end of this year (2016). Your symptoms may not appear until January 2017 or later. A person's response is influenced by many factors. For example, your age, the type of MS, how long you have had it, your medication, lifestyle habits, and environmental factors can all affect how well you respond to treatment.

Answer: This disease is treatable, but a diagnosis requires careful evaluation. The majority of people with MS do very well. Most people with MS recover completely without disability within 4 years after receiving their first dose of a new drug. However, some people don't get better for several months after they begin taking their first course of an older drug. In addition, as in any chronic condition such as diabetes, the best way to determine whether you'll make a full recovery is to monitor your progress, follow your doctor's instructions carefully and use medications that help prevent future relapse. With each successive dose of an anti-inflammatory drug, your risk of developing recurrent relapses increases. Once you've made substantial progress in managing your MS symptoms and have made two consecutive doses of an anti-inflammatory drug, the likelihood that you'll recur becomes less likely.

In summary, the good news is that many people who develop multiple sclerosis experience improvement over time, with few permanent consequences. People who manage their illness effectively also tend to make significant gains in quality of life over time. If you have been diagnosed with MS and you want to understand how effective treatments work, you might benefit from consulting an MS specialist.

Note: This web page was last updated July 8, 2018.","Most people who have MS see improvement after one year of treatment with steroids or other forms of therapy. People who do not respond to this treatment typically go on to develop relapsing MS. The sooner you get relief from your symptoms the better. You can also try another medication such as an anti-inflammatory or muscle relaxant medicine (such as clonidine). After 1 year you should be able to walk normally for more than short distances without assistance. Your doctor may need to monitor how well you are doing in light tasks as part of a full physical examination.\nQuestion: Can I eat and drink anything but chocolate while taking MS medications? Complete Answer: Yes. Even if you think it is safe to eat, do so only slowly, particularly if your symptoms worsen. While eating foods that contain sugar, salt, or fat increases the risk of developing diabetes, eating foods rich in fiber improves blood flow to the brain and prevents damage. It helps your body digest food better. If you find yourself having difficulty concentrating or remembering things because your eyes are glazed over, stop eating and drinking until you can perform these tasks correctly again. If you have trouble walking, ask your doctor whether it might be best to use a cane or walker for mobility. Ask your doctor before starting any new drug you take that has been linked to an increased incidence of depression. This could cause an increase in depression. \nQuestions: How often does my doctor prescribe the oral corticosteroid meds that I'm taking? Complete Answer: Your physician recommends the lowest dose and duration of each prescription when possible. However, some drugs that are commonly prescribed by doctors will be available over-the-counter at most pharmacies throughout the United States. Your doctor will tell you what products are available over the counter. Be sure to follow up with him once you return home from your travels to make sure that all doses of all medicines you're taking remain effective and appropriate during your stay in America. Questions: What kind of vitamin supplements am I required to take? Complete Answer: All vitamins and minerals must be taken according to their label's instructions. The following supplements are recommended for people who receive multiple sclerosis services: Vitamin B12

Folic Acid

Calcium

Iron

Niacinamide

Vitamin D3

Manganese

Magnesium

Vitamins C and E, beta carotene, folic acid, riboflavin, vitamin A, vitamin B6, thiamine mononitrate","The first time you notice any improvement in your MS symptoms is when you have the right treatment for them. This includes starting treatment as soon as possible. The sooner treatments are started, the more likely you will see some results within a few months. However, there are many other factors that can affect how quickly treatment works and whether it helps or not. If you don't get treatment before you develop symptoms, they may get worse or even be permanent. Treatment will take longer if you don't try it early. It may also take several years (or decades) before you actually experience benefit from your MS treatment. And finally, the sooner you begin treatment, the less chance you'll experience side effects. But don't give up! It's very hard to let go of MS, no matter what. Remember to check in regularly every 2 - 3 weeks to make sure that you're still feeling well.

The type of MS (autoimmune, autoimmune, or chronic)

Initiated therapy such as medications

Current medications used to treat MS

How long after initiation of an MS therapy does it last? How do you know how much time has passed since therapy began? Answer: Multiple Sclerosis may improve more quickly than other diseases, depending on your individual response to different types of therapies. For example, if you respond well to corticosteroids (an anti-inflammatory drug), the treatment might continue to help you for years. If you respond poorly to these drugs, however, a new regimen will be prescribed for at least three months while you undergo evaluation by your doctor. What is the average length of time between when you receive a diagnosis of MS and when you start receiving MS treatments? \nQuestion: Where do I go to get information about my disease? Complete Answer: You should check your local public library or call one of your local MS societies for information on current research. Also see our MS Center Web page. How often does the first symptom of MS appear? Answer: All people experience their first symptoms once they develop lesions on their brain. As time goes on, symptoms become increasingly severe and less frequent. Generally speaking, a person starts to feel sick soon after his/her initial appearance. In some cases, however, this early onset may not occur until later in life. After the initial appearance of the first symptom, the progression of the illness may take 2, 4, 8, 10 or even 12 weeks, but not necessarily longer. When will I begin to feel better? Answer: This varies greatly according to what disease you have. Some conditions (such as glaucoma) cause progressive loss of motor function. Others (including Alzheimer's disease) cause progressive deterioration of cognitive functions. The earliest you would probably notice any real improvement would depend on which of the two disorders you have. However, even in the case of glaucoma, it takes up to a year before symptoms really improve. Other forms of MS affect both eyes, such as optic neuritis. These conditions usually have very short recovery times, typically taking only 3 or 6 weeks, so there is no need to wait for the worst to happen!

Your treatments may also be changed if they don't work as well as expected or if side effects become problematic.\nQuestion: My insurance company refused to cover my MRSA vaccine. Is this true? Complete Answer: Yes. Most insurers will not pay for a single-dose vaccination against the bacteria that causes methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) unless it is accompanied by another medication that reduces the risk of infection. However, this situation has changed recently with the emergence of multi-antibiotic strategies such as metronidazole, which includes several other antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, vancomycin, or tetracycline.

Complete Answer: Visit www.ms.gov/about-health/publications/factsheets/disease_and_treatments/index.html \nQuestion: What is the difference between the flu shot and the nasal spray? Complete Answer: The influenza vaccine contains a live virus. This protects against the virus but does not protect against many other infectious diseases. The nasal spray also provides protection against some viruses, including those that cause nasal infections such as pneumonia and respiratory syncytial virus. It is important that children receive both vaccines as soon as possible because a weakened immune system leads to an increased chance of catching the flu during the first year of life.

I want my doctor to be compensated for his time, skills, and services. How can I get this?\n

There are two ways you can make sure your physician gets paid for his work with us. One way is to write to him or her directly. The other is to call our office, which we handle 24 hours per day. You can send your request in writing or fax it in. We accept credit cards, cash, personal checks, money orders, or MasterCard. All payments must be received within 30 days. Call us at (800) 842-7927 or send an email to ms@mssociety.org. Please include as much detail as possible about the problem, including when you first found out about the problems. Our staff works very hard every single day to keep your requests as brief as possible. Once the request has been reviewed and approved, we will forward it along to your doctor and pay all or part of the expense incurred by the doctor for the requested care. Your doctor will always tell you whether the care was covered under Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance. Any claim submitted to us through a third party provider such as a hospital or another health care organization cannot receive reimbursement from us. It","This question is meant for those who already have MS or know someone who does and are looking for information on how they can be helped.\nQuestion: If you had chronic pain, would it help to take ibuprofen, a medication used for arthritis relief, for the first few days of treatment?\nAnswer: Yes. In fact, patients who received pain relievers without a prescription often found them more effective than the painkillers they were taking.\nQuestion: Does a pill that takes less than an hour to swallow have any effect on my weight, body fat percentage, or muscle mass? Is there any difference in the results of different foods eaten throughout the day?\nAnswer: The answer depends on your diet, exercise habits, and your health status. For example, if you eat a diet high in carbohydrates, you may lose some muscle mass in the short term but gain it back when you stop eating carbs. Also, while your body burns calories, its metabolism also uses stored body fat as fuel, so there's no direct way to tell which foods might have an impact on your weight, body fat percentage, or overall fitness level. It doesn't matter whether you're overweight, underweight, or normal, because these factors can all affect how much body fat you'll store. On the other hand, it's likely that you won't get any significant improvements in your overall physical performance by simply cutting out carbohydrate intake during this time period. That being said, many people do report feeling a slight benefit from consuming a small amount of starch (such as table sugar) just before a meal.\nIf your doctor has prescribed certain drugs such as blood thinner warfarin, then it's possible that the medications may cause changes in your appetite and/or the ability to control your hunger. Some other drugs, however, might not require a prescription, including most antidepressants and some migraine medicines. However, some prescription drugs should not be taken before or after taking other medications, especially if you've recently been diagnosed with a serious condition like cancer. Keep this in mind if you decide to continue taking the drug or change it significantly.

Frequently Asked Questions About Multiple Sclerosis How long does it take to develop multiple sclerosis?\nThe average age at onset of MS is between 15 and 25 years old. At least one person in 100 experiences early onset of the disease; usually a third to half of people experience full disability within 5 to 10 years of diagnosis. Some individuals with MS develop progressive symptoms over decades rather than years","If you have MS, the earliest possible symptoms may be a decrease in fatigue, fatigue associated with pain, numbness or weakness of one arm or leg, loss of balance or feeling on both legs, problems with your vision (blind spots) that increase when you stand up, headaches, dizziness, memory problems, and joint pain. Your doctor will help you determine which types of symptoms mean more than others, so he/she can prescribe medicine appropriately for each patient.

How do you treat my chronic pain?\nQuestion: How long should I wait before switching medications? Complete Answer: A patient's response to anti-inflammatory medications depends on their condition and how severe they were at diagnosis and progression. However, most physicians will recommend continuing medication only if there is evidence of continued improvement. Some examples include a decrease in pain intensity, improvement in sleep patterns, reduction in nighttime stiffness, and/or a change in frequency of attacks. See our article on managing chronic pain for further specifics.

Complete Answer: In order to avoid unnecessary complications, physicians often prescribe the use of alcohol as an anti-inflammatory. However, there is no evidence that moderate amounts of alcohol ingestion can result in liver injury. In fact, there is conflicting scientific research showing that very high levels of alcohol consumption lead to increased risk of cirrhosis of the liver.

Reference \/ \/ \/ \/ Question 1: How long does it take for my heart to beat? Answer: Your heart will start beating within a few seconds after birth. You'll be able to feel your heartbeat right away. It won't actually beat until several minutes later.\nQuestion 2: What kind of oxygen is in my body? Answer: Oxygen comes from your lungs. The main types of oxygen used by your body are O2 and O3. There's also a small amount of nitrogen (N2), but that's very rare in the environment. In fact, when your lungs fill with oxygen, they stop releasing carbon dioxide. All other oxygen your body uses is O2. As your oxygen level drops below 30% of your respiratory rate, the kidneys begin to produce enough water to keep you alive. If you have an issue like asthma or COPD, you may need to increase the oxygen content of your diet.\r

References \/ \/ \/ \/ Q1: Do animals have lungs? Answer: Animals don't have lungs because their bodies just don't have the capacity. When an animal breathes air, the lungs compress as well as any other part of its body; however, they're not capable of moving blood around. Therefore, if you breathe from the lungs, you don't get full use of all the oxygen available from the air. Instead, you get only about half of what you'd otherwise get. And since there aren't many organs (including the heart) that can expand enough to allow oxygen to flow easily through them, the tissues inside the lungs simply can't absorb all the oxygen.\r

Provide useful, complete, and scientifically-grounded answers to common consumer search queries about health.\nQuestion: most efficient and sustainable diets\nComplete Answer:","You can help by providing detailed information on what is healthy and what foods you eat. In addition, as the Food Information Network (FIN) has stated, ``If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, please feel free to contact us.'' \1\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ The FIN Web site is www.foodinfornetwork.com. \2\ See http://www.healthfactsnet.org/fact_sheets/finaffact.html for more information. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- For example, consumers generally want to know if it is safe to feed animals such as cattle or poultry on a diet of corn gluten meal, soybean oil, fish oils, and other animal fats and oils (such as butter). In contrast, many people who work with children also ask about whether feeding breast milk is appropriate when infants are fed formula. What should a physician do? Physicians must be knowledgeable in this area so that they can provide clear, accurate, nonjudgmental advice regarding nutrition. There are several reasons why physicians may not offer dietary recommendations. First, it would violate their professional duties, including ethical standards as well as those of practicing medicine. Second, some doctors might fear that doing so could lead to a loss of license. Third, there is evidence that patients' perceptions of a doctor's lack of knowledge about nutrition affect how likely they will seek treatment, even if the advice was actually provided. Finally, because many people distrust food companies, doctors might fear that giving them wrong information could cause them to lose business. As one expert told Dr. Katz, ``It is always better to inform than convince.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \3\ This statement came from a telephone interview conducted June 23, 1999. While both parents were interviewed separately, these statements are taken together. It is not possible to verify that either parent's testimony is entirely accurate. On balance, however, it seems reasonable that the two parents may have had some degree of credibility based on their experiences as pediatricians and perhaps their own experience in working with adolescents. Indeed, both parents told me that they had treated their adolescent child for eating disorders and that both did not think it advisable to continue treating the child without addressing his nutritional needs first. In any event, I find it unlikely that, given their past experience, they would make an unsupported decision to treat this patient for eating problems without a thorough evaluation of the patient's nutritional needs. On balance, then, we cannot conclude that they gave incorrect information. If anything, I found their testimony to be consistent with that","http://www.naturalhealth365.com/diet/

In addition to the simple answers provided by this website and other resources, you can find more detailed information from experts on this topic.","I can't answer that for you personally but I will point out some of the major factors involved in dietary changes to reduce our consumption of saturated fat, cholesterol, sugar, sodium (potassium), and trans fats. \nIn particular, an important factor is exercise; these changes will improve your overall health by increasing your ability to burn body heat efficiently. Another factor involves reducing salt intake while maintaining good blood pressure control (which is also associated with better heart health).\nQuestion: how much salt does it take to make me sick?\nAnswer: The average American consumes more than 1,000 mg per day of salt; it takes between 2,500 and 4,500 mg to cause vomiting.\nQuestion: what should i eat when my baby is born?\nQuestion: if you want to get healthy, what should we do first?\nAnswer: Start by eating foods high in potassium. If you've been drinking too many sodas or other sodas with added sugars, your body may be storing more potassium and converting it into excitotoxins like lactate and hydrogen ions (see page 5). It's best to start with water until your pH balance improves so you can drink alkaline drinks such as pure lemonade or fruit juice with no added sweeteners. You will notice that your urine pH will increase along with your sodium and calcium intakes, which is normal if you're consuming enough minerals. Once your electrolytes are balanced, eat more vegetables such as leafy greens, spinach, cabbage, carrots, celery, beet root, and parsley. These are rich sources of potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, and vitamin C. They are very low in calories and contain fiber, vitamins B1, B3, B6, folate, calcium, iron, and protein. Drink at least one glass of nonfat milk a day with your fruits and veggies. Keep all protein intake the same, preferably under 10 grams/day and preferably less, because high protein diets tend to lead to increased cravings for carbohydrates and sugar. \nQuestion: can I get sick from food that has not been cooked yet?\nQuestion: why don't you use ""raw"" food instead of canned foods? \nQuestion: if I am on a diet, can I consume dairy products?\nQuestion: how long before I feel hungry again after I have eaten? What happens if I become ill with dehydration?\nAnswer: Foods containing proteins and fat (such as meats) are","A diet rich in fruits and vegetables is an excellent dietary choice for people with chronic health problems such as obesity. The recommended amount of daily fiber (4-6 cups) provided by fruit and vegetable consumption is at least one cup per day for every 2 to 3 pounds of body weight. For women, it should be no more than 1/2 cup per day and for men, 1 cup per day. Most studies have shown that consuming fruits and vegetables provides better nutrition compared to eating foods high in refined carbohydrates or protein. There is some research indicating that people who eat more fruit and vegetables also tend to live longer than those who do not eat these foods, but this has yet to be established. In addition, most of the published evidence suggests that eating whole grains may reduce their risk of certain cancers. \nQuestion: I am currently taking a combination pill containing both acetaminophen and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB). What is the proper dosage? Complete Answer: It depends on how long you take the medication. Do not take more than one pill at a time if you take it often or if you get headaches. Also, if you use this drug while you are pregnant, tell your doctor. If you feel ill, tell your doctor right away. Some other drugs like aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may be prescribed to treat mild pain during treatment with acetaminophen. Although there has been less research, there does not appear to be any increased risk of cancer after taking medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. However, there are many reports of patients developing side effects including liver damage. This can occur because some NSAIDs prevent stomach acid from being released. Your doctor will want to monitor your liver function before making any decisions regarding acetaminophen therapy for arthritis or other conditions. Do not stop taking medications without first talking to your doctor. Acetaminophen is classified as a Schedule IV narcotic drug under federal law. Many states regulate its use in accordance with their laws. If you need further information, call your local state's Drug Enforcement Administration office.

So you should look for evidence that indicates what is best for your particular individual needs before making any dietary changes.\nComment: You seem to be trying to create a false dichotomy between dieting, or eating unhealthy, and not eating. I am sure you would like to avoid this kind of discussion in order to keep it more personal. It is certainly true that dieters may find these issues very difficult to address, as well as others who choose not to eat at all. In fact, most people don't know what is good for them - so when their choices are challenged, they often react by becoming defensive and aggressive. The difference here is that you do know what's good for you, because you've been doing something about it since childhood, and because you have the ability to use logic and reason to make an informed decision about what you want to eat. If you could just stop acting like a child who does not understand the implications of her actions, then perhaps we wouldn't need such heated debates over what people should and shouldn't eat. At the very least, you would gain some understanding of why your decisions are being questioned, which is important if we want to build a healthier society, where everyone has access to nutritious food. Unfortunately, many of us simply won't learn from our mistakes until we go through life with little regard to consequences.","Healthy dietary patterns consist of many foods and nutrients that meet the nutritional needs of all types of people in our society, including vegetarians, vegans, and those who follow a low-fat or no fat diet.

In fact, most Americans get too little calcium from their food supply. In addition, consuming excess amounts of refined sugar is also a concern for bone health, since it raises blood pressure, increases insulin levels and encourages weight gain.

The USDA recommends eating at least one serving (two servings) of fruit every day, and drinking six glasses of water per day if you're going to be exercising regularly. Vegetables, beans, nuts, seeds, grains and legumes are good choices as well. For more information on vegetables, see this site.

Most healthy diets include fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grain products, fish and meat, eggs, dairy products and protein-rich foods such as nuts, seeds and soy.

To minimize your risks of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes and cancer, eat a balanced diet with a variety of meats, seafood, poultry and other proteins. Choose lean meats over fatty ones because these tend to have less saturated fats and cholesterol than red meat and chicken; choose lean seafood over fatty tuna because it's high in omega-3s. And avoid fried foods and packaged meals, which can contain added sugars and other unhealthy ingredients.

Saturated fats should not appear in processed foods because they increase LDL (""bad"") cholesterol by reducing its ability to carry oxygen to tissues where it is needed. However, in moderation, these fats help build muscle tissue, thereby helping maintain normal cardiovascular function.","A high protein diet of > 25% fat is more energy dense than a low protein diet that is less energy dense. There is no evidence that the human body can tolerate this type of diet because it leads to increased blood pressure in addition to weight loss.

In fact, one recent study found that eating just 2% of your total calories as protein leads to greater weight loss than eating only 20% of your caloric intake. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18240582) And, a 2010 study at the University of Maryland School of Medicine found that increasing dietary protein intake resulted in larger reductions in body mass index than did decreasing carbohydrates. Another 2008 study by the UMass Amherst Department of Nutrition showed that the amount of dietary protein is not enough for optimal nutrition, but that you do need sufficient amounts of carbohydrate to help the body maintain its homeostasis. It does this through ""the insulin secretory response."" The reason for this is simple – when you eat carbs, you release glucose into the bloodstream, which increases appetite; however, if you don't have an adequate amount of carbohydrates circulating, the body will try to use some of them to produce energy.\nQuestion: what is the optimum macronutrient ratio? Complete Answer: This depends on several factors including muscle mass, age, gender, sex hormones and overall diet quality. Many people consider 3 to 5 grams of protein per pound of lean body mass to be ideal. You should aim for between 1.5 and 2 grams per pound of bodyweight, although those with a lower baseline may find it easier to get there. If you are overweight or obese, you may want to limit your protein to 0.7 to 0.9 grams per pound of body weight, and you should avoid any foods that cause insulin resistance, such as fast food, processed meats, fried foods, white bread, sugar-sweetened beverages and chocolate. Some people find that higher levels of protein lead to better insulin sensitivity, while others report decreased insulin sensitivity after consuming protein.\nQuestion: how much protein should I take everyday? Complete Answer: Always check the label on your supplement before taking. Too little protein will probably make you feel bloated and sluggish, so it's best to aim for at least 2 g of protein daily. Also keep in mind that many supplements contain ingredients which contain both essential amino acids and small amounts of casein proteins. In general, be sure to read all of the ingredients labels of each product to","If you have time, read this article. The following links will help you find the answer you need to your question:

Q4. How can I get more information on what foods contain which nutrients? A. Information is provided by the USDA Food and Nutrition Service and other sources on www.fns.usda.gov/foodguidelines. Each nutrient has an appropriate code in the nutrient database that identifies its nature and quantity as well as its nutritional content. Use this link for nutrient values based on food groups in the U.S. and Canada (http://www.nutritiondata.com). These tables also include recommended daily intakes for several important nutrient types with additional links to additional resources on the following Web sites (http://www.nutritiondata.com/data/index.html): USDA Nutrient Data Laboratory (NDL), http://ndl.usda.gov; American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR), http://www.cancer.org/cancertopics/nutritional_information.htm; Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Services (USDA FNS), http://nutritiondata.fns.usda.gov/data.html; University of Michigan School of Public Health, https://healthdata.umich.edu/Nutrition/NutritionDataSources.aspx?src=NUTRITIONDATA_HISTORY

What is an ""estrogen""? Answer: It's one of several hormones in men that help regulate body growth. Estrogens are important for normal development of bones, skin color, muscle strength, hair color, and eye colour; and they also increase blood flow throughout the body to stimulate sex drive. \nQuestion: what foods contain high amounts of estrogen? Complete Answer: The following foods contain high levels of estrogen: Beef, chicken, eggs, dairy products, fish, nuts, seeds, soybeans, spinach, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, avocados, and bananas. \r


What causes estrogen deficiency? Answer: This disorder typically results from not getting enough dietary or other sources of vitamin E, which is needed for healthy hormone production, as well as many vitamins. Other conditions causing low estrogen may include autoimmune disorders such as lupus, asthma, thyroid disease, ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, breast cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and infertility.

Why do you think so many women experience infertility? Answer: In some cases, it has long been known that people with hypothyroidism have reduced fertility due to impaired metabolism in their bodies. However, there are no studies showing that hypothyroidism leads to decreased fertility in most couples. Studies show that couples who both have hypothyroidism usually have different levels of reproductive function. Some research shows that a woman whose ovaries produce less than 5 milligrams of thyroid per day has reduced sexual desire. Others report that women without infertility often do not develop symptoms until later in life because their ovaries aren't functioning properly, and therefore don't show any signs or symptoms. To learn more, please visit the Internet Infertility Center at http://www.infobetterscenter.com/. What is abnormal bleeding during pregnancy? Answer: Normal menstrual cycles, including those experienced after childbirth, result in a continuous discharge of fluid. This fluid contains various nutrients, proteins, and fatty acids that are vital for fetal development. Fertilization does occur between days 24 and 27 of your cycle. But, if you miss a period before the 28th day of your last"

Provide useful, complete, and scientifically-grounded answers to common consumer search queries about health.\nQuestion: benefits of physical activity\nComplete Answer:","\nThe benefits of regular physical activity may include increased body weight loss, improved cardiovascular function, decreased risk for diabetes, and improvement in your general mental well being.

To view more information on this topic, please visit the NIH Fact Sheet entitled ""Physical Activity.""","Physical fitness is associated with increased longevity, improved heart health, lower risk of some cancers, reduced rates of diabetes, low blood pressure, decreased incidence of depression, and even greater overall quality of life. In the long term, regular exercise increases your body's ability to resist disease and protect against its onset. It also improves mental acuity as well. Exercise may improve your general sense of wellbeing, as well as your mood and memory.\nQuestion: when can I expect my child's first steps? \nAnswer: Your baby will probably start walking at around 6 months old. He or she should be able to walk barefoot on grass, dirt, rocks, and other surfaces until age 5. By then, he or she should have started climbing stairs by his or her own accord. At that point you can encourage him or her to get up and try some activities like pushups, situps, and pull-ups (or just take them for a spin). If he or she isn't interested in starting new things, you can give it a few years and see if they choose their own routes. The key here is to not overtrain your child; don't rush him or her too early! This is especially true for older children who can become very picky about what they want from their parents. Many babies find playing with toys challenging at first, but they quickly learn how to control themselves. While younger kids might enjoy being held and cuddled, it takes longer for them to develop this skill. As they grow into adolescence, your toddler will most likely begin to explore their world independently of you. Eventually, he or she will need more supervision than usual, particularly if he or she's walking down the street to play or exploring new terrain. You'll still help him or her along by making sure everything goes smoothly—but now you can provide lots of different kinds of encouragement, so your child won't feel overwhelmed. Ask questions later in the day so your child knows what to do next. When you're done talking, ask another question. \nQuestion: how much sleep does my child usually need? \nAnswer: Your baby's needs are determined by your child's age, growth rate, and developmental stage. During the first year of your child's life, he or she may need between 3 and 4 hours of sleep per night. After that, he or she tends to require between 6 and 7 hours of sleep per night. For a full list of sleeping recommendations, visit our Sleeping Habits page. When your child starts","Some evidence shows that physical activity can help your body control cholesterol levels, improve blood pressure, lower the risk for heart disease, control high blood sugar, reduce inflammation in the body, support good nerve function, protect against osteoporosis, lower risks of cancer, strengthen bones, and increase energy levels. It is important to note that many people who have a low BMI (body mass index) already have metabolic problems and should not start exercising unless they want to lose weight or change their eating habits. Physical exercise helps prevent diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer by reducing fat cells, increasing muscle mass, lowering blood glucose levels, increasing energy, decreasing insulin resistance, and improving energy metabolism. The American Heart Association recommends at least 30 minutes per day of moderate aerobic activity for most adults aged 20 years and older and 60 minutes per day for children under age 6.\nComment: \r

Physical activity improves the quality of life and reduces cardiovascular illness risk. In fact, physical activity may be one of the best ways to decrease the risk of developing several chronic conditions linked to coronary artery disease such as hypertension, stroke, congestive heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, and obesity. Physical activity should also serve as an effective stress management tool because it increases cognitive functioning, enhances mood, raises self-esteem, and builds resilience to future events. This advice applies to both women and men and should apply particularly to those with chronic illnesses or other disabilities such as mental retardation and Alzheimer's disease. There are many factors beyond one's individual circumstances that influence one's level of physical activity. For example, young adults who are not active often have more severe health complications than do non-active individuals. People with impaired vision, hearing impairments, or physical handicaps should generally avoid physical activity, even if it does not interfere with work or school. The following table lists some of these factors. However, there are numerous other factors that determine whether someone engages in vigorous physical activity. For example, genetics plays a role in determining how much you can physically do or what kinds of activities might hurt you. Your own personal goals are also likely to affect your level of physical activity. For example, if you want to become ""fat"" but cannot physically tolerate carbohydrates, then you will probably have difficulty engaging in vigorous physical activity. If you want to get stronger but can't lift heavy objects or push yourself out of bed, then you may have trouble reaching your highest potential physical fitness level. Although people can vary greatly in their ability to","How many calories do I need to burn per day? This depends on your age, sex, height, weight, and activity level. The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 calories daily for women and 130 calories daily for men. You can find more information about how much you should eat from the Centers for Disease Control website at http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth. \nDefinition of Energy Balance: Your body needs energy in order to keep itself functioning normally. If it doesn't get enough energy, it will stop functioning and may even die.\n\nOne way to calculate your energy balance is by dividing your body's total weight (in pounds) times 7074. The answer is usually between 0.86 and 1.0. In most cases, this figure represents a good estimate of your caloric intake.\nTo learn what foods contain the highest amounts of calories, visit http://www.fda.gov/Food/Guidelines/ucm2660892.htm#Eating_Nutrient_Dense.\nThe USDA Food Pyramid has been updated to reflect the current Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which advise eating a wide variety of healthy food choices.

Email us.","You can play an important role in helping your children become active for many reasons.\nQuestion: how do I get the most out of exercise? Complete Answer: For one thing, you need to have good balance and flexibility to move around quickly and easily. Also, your child needs to be able to use his/her hands to keep themselves warm when exercising. However, as long as they stay within their body's limits (no more than 30 minutes), there is no reason to stop exercising entirely. In fact, exercise should always be part of any healthy diet. Another key benefit to exercise is that it may help with reducing stress levels and anxiety. \nQuestion: what if my child falls down during exercise or gets hurt? Complete Answer: First of all, don't worry--you're not alone. Your son or daughter will recover quickly. If you think your child might need medical attention, call 911 immediately! There is nothing worse than running into someone who was injured. To learn more about exercise safety, visit http://www.healthypeople.com/exercisesafety/. \nQuestion: what should i bring when I go jogging? Complete Answer: When you go jogging, you should carry along several things: a water bottle to refill your hydration pack; something to hold onto so you don't slip off; a jacket or sweatshirt to protect yourself from cold weather. Also, carrying a flashlight and extra batteries helps to find your way back home after a hard run. While in the woods, be sure to take care to wear sturdy shoes and a hat. It's also wise to carry some clothing to change into on the trail, such as rain pants or a warm pair of hiking boots. Finally, make sure to leave plenty of room between you and your surroundings.\nQuestion: How much does yoga cost? Complete Answer: Yoga starts at $40 per hour and includes a variety of activities including tai chi, kundalini yoga, tantric yoga, and breathing meditation. Many teachers charge by the session, which means that it doesn't matter whether it takes 15 minutes or 45 minutes. Most schools also offer classes for adults, which usually runs under 10 minutes and costs $25 to $30 per hour.

Answer: Physical activity is essential for your well-being and can improve many different conditions including heart disease, cancer, arthritis, diabetes, back pain, etc. The American Heart Association's website (www.heart.org) has more information on physical activity, including how to start exercising and what to do after you're finished.","\r

\n\nIn general, moderate amounts of vigorous physical activity can reduce the risk of many chronic diseases by improving heart rate control (by increasing exercise endurance), lowering blood pressure (by decreasing blood sugar levels), reducing inflammation in the body (by raising HDL cholesterol) and increasing bone density. Increased physical activity may also improve general health by stimulating the immune system and maintaining good blood lipid profiles. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your local Health Center for more information on how to get healthy with an active lifestyle.\nQuestion: who should wear glasses if I am over 50?\nAnswer: Anybody over 50 should have no problem seeing clearly and hearing well without prescription glasses. It is normal to develop the look of old age as our bodies do not produce new lenses at the same rate. While this does not mean that all will become blind, most would like to see better because it makes their lives easier and provides them with greater comfort. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends that people older than 65 be tested periodically for vision problems. For example, when considering whether to wear corrective lenses, consider factors such as age and eye disease severity. If you experience blurred vision after wearing glasses, you should try replacing the lens with one that allows clearer light and more natural color perception. You might want to consult with a licensed optometrist before taking any action. In addition to glasses, most adults with severe visual impairment should use artificial vision devices. These can provide better vision in low light conditions but they are often expensive and difficult to purchase. To find out what to do about the cost and accessibility of these devices, contact your local Health Center.","Most people can benefit from at least some amount of exercise each week.

You should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. If you're over 50 years old, aim for 250 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week. There's no need to wear special gear (such as a heart rate monitor), and it doesn't matter whether you run on flat ground or on hills or on the beach; just don't do it all in one sitting! When you get home from work each day, take a walk around your neighborhood—especially if it's hot outside. This will increase your blood circulation and help reduce stress and burn calories. For most people, this will be enough to keep you feeling fresh throughout the day. And don't forget that exercise also helps with weight control, increases sexual enjoyment, improves mood, reduces the risk of osteoporosis, and even lowers your risk for cancer. The more you know about the importance of exercise, the easier it'll become to find ways to get some extra practice into your daily routine, especially when you realize how much more powerful it really is than most of us think. Exercise can improve your memory, concentration, coordination, and general mental sharpness. It may even help you remember important details about the past, such as where you were when you last saw your family or what your plans are for tomorrow. \nQuestion: side effects of certain drugs\nAnswer: Some medications, including many antidepressants, have serious side effects, such as dizziness, drowsiness, and nausea, especially during extended use. However, only a few of these drugs are known to cause liver damage, so they probably won't harm you or interfere with other treatment programs. Keep in mind that not all side effects are caused by drugs, which means that you could still benefit from taking them.

Anesthesia or anesthesia is an essential part of the delivery process. There are several types of anesthesia used during childbirth, including midwifery and surgical. Although many women will have an epidural, this may not be possible due to their current position or because of personal reasons. If you're having a vaginal birth, you can choose between either the epidural or the local anesthetic. If you're experiencing discomfort with either option, it's best to try both before making your final decision. The epidural is administered by inserting a tube through which fluid is pumped into the cervix. This technique is known as epidurals. Some doctors use lidocaine, which is injected directly into the muscle walls and helps relax the muscles involved. Local anesthetics are often applied intravenously to help control pain during labor and delivery. When choosing an epidural, ask whether there will be any risks for you and your baby. Do you need to wait at least 24 hours after injection? How long should I hold my breath if my blood pressure gets too high while the epidural is being inserted? Can we monitor your heart rate while using the epidural? What if I'm allergic to the medication? Are there any side effects? Question: how do I know when the epidural has been put in correctly? Complete Answer: You'll want to listen carefully to what the doctor says before trying to insert the epidural. While some women prefer to simply push down on the back of the table until they feel no pain, others find that if they place their hands near the base of the table, then lean forward a little bit, they can feel the needle coming out easily. Another tip is to press gently against your abdomen before putting your feet on the table to make sure the needles don't slide away from the skin. Ask yourself a few simple questions to determine if your body is ready to receive this treatment: Is the epidural comfortable? Does the insertion feel right? Will this procedure take more than a minute? If so, ask the doctor or nurse to start slowly with the insertion process. A gentle tingling sensation could indicate that your body feels ready to receive the epidural injection. Are you able to move the seat up or down as needed? Does it hurt? If so, don't hesitate to stop the epidural, but don't rush into giving birth if the procedure takes longer than expected. In some cases, the epidural can last up to two hours. However, if","The following is an excerpt from a survey of 1,000 pregnant women who were asked questions related to pregnancy (and their experiences):


When did you become pregnant? What was the first symptom of labor or birth? Where were you when this happened? When did you have your last period after conception? Did it happen before or during your third month of pregnancy? What caused the pain and bleeding that occurred at delivery? How long did it take you to recover? Are you still breastfeeding your baby? Was there any physical change during pregnancy? Was there any difference between the types of birth that took place for both mother and baby?

Complete Answer: \nFemale males can have penises or vaginas. Female females may have breasts, vulva, clitoris, labia, penis, uterus, ovaries, ovotestes, fallopian tubes, cervix and other reproductive organs. Male mammals also have penises or vaginas. The two sexes differ in many ways but are similar enough that their differences must be treated as separate entities when discussing sex issues. Females do not menstruate; they don't get pregnant; and they have no sexual desire, so it is easy to determine whether they are biologically male or female. Males do not develop secondary sex characteristics, such as hair growing on the chest or genitals, while females do. Males and females are completely different animals with very different physiology. Their differences result from sexual differentiation in development. They are not genetically the same except in some cases where one has been artificially created by evolution to reproduce and survive. It is important to understand that sex is not fixed at birth. There are no single chromosomes in either sex; all the genetic material is inherited equally throughout life. In human beings, each person shares 25% of his or her DNA with every member of the opposite sex and 50% with everyone else. All individuals share about 80% of their genes.

Answer: Most women experience little, if any, negative impact upon their fertility levels following menopause, so there is no reason to worry about becoming pregnant again. However, a woman should consider her options carefully before giving birth.\nQuestion: what are the risks of having twins?\nAnswer: Although the benefits of twin pregnancies outweigh the risks, these two births pose unique concerns. Twinning is rare and the consequences are unpredictable. Each child carries both genetic material and an increased chance of transmitting the disease. Some women who get twins may develop serious problems such as chromosomal abnormalities, heart defects, eye problems, kidney failure, and respiratory issues. Also, most twins","Common Medical Complications of Pregnancy - Q&A

Question: What is the difference between miscarriage and abortion?\nAnswer: This question can be answered using several simple and clear signs. The first sign that you may have experienced an abortion (miscarriage) is if your baby has stopped developing fully or if it does not grow at all. You may also have experienced this type of symptom after a miscarriage. A more severe form of abortion involves removing all or part of the fetus from the uterus through some means other than surgery. Other symptoms include nausea and vomiting; pain during sex or masturbation; loss of body weight; loss of interest in things like eating, sleeping, or sex; irritability or anger; inability to concentrate or to keep up with daily tasks; headaches; difficulty thinking clearly; changes in behavior; problems concentrating or remembering information; and emotional problems. In addition, there could be problems with breastfeeding, or if your baby becomes premature or small for his or her age. If you experience any of these symptoms, seek immediate professional assistance or contact your local clinic immediately. Your doctor will evaluate whether you need to undergo further treatment and then recommend what steps should be taken to ensure that future pregnancies continue without complications.","Some of the more common ones include miscarriage, stillbirth (aborted fetus), preterm birth (preborn baby born before 37 weeks of gestation), premature rupture of membranes, perinatal asphyxia (suffocation or suffocation due to lack of oxygen in the mother's blood), and intrauterine growth retardation.\nQuestion: how is it possible for an unborn child to survive after being born? Complete Answer:

It depends on many factors including the gestational age of the mother, what type of treatment the woman has received, whether she was pregnant at all, and whether she had any previous miscarriages. If the fetal heart beats during delivery, then you can say that the mother survived.\nQuestion: if I am sick and my husband takes me to the hospital to be treated, does he have to pay for this as part of our insurance plan? Complete Answer:

Yes. That includes paying for anesthesia, a bedside manner of care, transportation to the hospital (if required) and some other non-emergency treatments. However, only the insured person has to pay for these things. The non-insured spouse must cover his or her share.\nQuestion: What happens to my policy when my husband dies? Complete Answer:

If your spouse dies without a will, your coverage under the policy ends immediately and the policy becomes subject to probate.\nQuestion: what happened to my car insurance when my husband died? Complete Answer:

Your car insurance stops covering accidents caused by drivers who were not covered under your policy. You may get additional coverage from another company or purchase an automobile liability plan.","(Please note that this is not an exhaustive list of possible complications.)


What causes the ""dancing baby"" syndrome? The dance party phenomenon is typically caused by a combination of stress, exhaustion, and excessive alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Stress can increase your risk for miscarriage if you drink heavily while pregnant (and even more so if you take drugs such as oxycodone or barbiturates). And high levels of stress may also play a role in other types of birth trauma—for example, the inability to get out of bed after childbirth, which can cause postpartum depression or withdrawal symptoms. While both of these effects do occur with pregnancy, they have different etiologies and treatments.\nAnxiety

A key symptom of anxiety and panic attacks is the sudden onset of episodes lasting longer than 3 hours. These episodes usually start suddenly and are followed by short periods of calm and relaxation. This often includes rapid movements around the house, screaming, crying, or rocking back and forth. If you experience any of these symptoms at all on or after a certain day, it's important to seek help immediately. Other signs of anxiety include feeling cold, anxious, and irritable. You may be sweating, panting, breathing faster, or having difficulty sleeping. Often times these behaviors are linked to the fear of losing control over situations involving anxiety. It is not uncommon for women who suffer from an episode of anxiety to lose their temper and yell or swear out loud in front of others. \nIf you feel that you are being excessively stressed or tense in public places or your ability to relax has been disrupted, talk to someone about taking some time off work and getting counseling. See our article on the best ways to avoid becoming too stressed before, during, and after pregnancy for additional information. Stressful Workplace

Even though there are many positive benefits associated with working outside the home, excessive stress can also be harmful, especially when combined with stressors related to the job itself. Even mild stress at work might result in poor performance and burnout. For instance, one study showed that workers whose jobs involved repetitive tasks experienced less satisfaction with their lives when compared to those who did not perform repetitive activities at work. That's why people should try to keep things simple, especially at work. One way to keep yourself healthy is to eat healthy foods throughout the day and to exercise regularly. However, not eating enough food and exercising too little can lead to weight gain and contribute to diabetes and heart disease, respectively. Exercise is another good"

A physician can rule out the possibility of any underlying illness before making a diagnosis. It may be due to the effects of age or to a physical injury or disease. The condition usually goes away on its own over time. Although this does not occur in everyone who experiences it, it should be treated immediately if you notice any symptom associated with the condition (such as swollen glands).

About the Author In her spare time, Elizabeth M. Vetter writes for various publications including ""Coffee"" magazine, The Medicine Wheel blog and she blogs at elizabethmverter.com. Her interest lies in food and wellness.","The flare can be caused by many different factors. In general, the most likely cause is that you have an enlarged thyroid gland, and the excess iodine (if it's present) may build up in your blood stream as a result of your elevated levels of iodine in your food or body fluids. When this happens, if not corrected, the thyroid gland becomes inflamed and produces too much of its own iodine, causing inflammation (irritation), which results in increased tissue damage and, ultimately, cancer (and death). A doctor must determine what kind of treatment is needed to correct the problem. There are several approaches available for treating the symptoms of hypothyroidism—in addition to thyroid hormone replacement therapy (which will restore your normal levels of thyroid hormones), there are also other treatments such as dietary changes, exercise, vitamin D supplementation, medication, and/or surgery.

Answer 2: Iodine deficiency is the second leading cause of cancer (after smoking.)

Iodine is essential to life. Unfortunately, we humans do not produce enough naturally occurring iodine. This leads to severe problems with metabolism and nervous system function due to deficiencies of iodine in our diet and environment. Our bodies naturally secrete small amounts of iodine from the skin, muscle tissues, hair, bones, organs, digestive tract, liver, and brain. We don't need to take supplements, but doing so can help to prevent certain diseases.

Question: How is iodine produced?

Answer 3: Most of the iodine you consume comes from eating foods that contain iodine (such as seaweed, egg yolk, citrus fruits, sea vegetables, nuts, garlic, soybean products, and fish oil). You also absorb some iodine through drinking water. But when you eat more iodine than you would otherwise get, your body manufactures larger amounts of radioactive iodide. That means that you may need to take extra precautions, even while traveling or during times where iodine supplements might be readily available.

Why does iodine become dangerous after ingestion?

Because of iodine's role in our bodies, it has been linked to adverse effects ranging from heart disease, stroke, osteoporosis, and multiple sclerosis to cancer, immune dysfunction, and even neurological disorders like dementia. It has been suggested that high consumption of iodine may increase the risk of developing cancers in various parts of the body. For example, one study found a link between consumption of iodine-rich foods and breast cancer, kidney cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, head and neck cancer, esoph","Heavy flare up of the lymphatic system (and/or lymph node) is caused by an increase in blood flow to the area. The lymphatic system works on a very basic principle called ""thickness"". When there is too much fluid, it can cause a blockage between two fluids. If this blockage causes irritation or discomfort, then you may be experiencing a heavy flare up of your lymphatic system. This is usually accompanied with inflammation of the tissues surrounding the blocked fluid. In some cases, this process will progress to more serious conditions such as leukopenia which means that excess fluid has been forced into the lungs. However, most people who experience heavy flare up of their lymphatic system do not have any signs or symptoms that could indicate the need for urgent attention from healthcare professionals. Some individuals may also suffer with other underlying diseases, including cancer, chronic fatigue syndrome and allergies. You should note that if you feel you might have any specific symptoms, such as chest pain, dizziness, numbness or tingling, then seek medical assistance immediately. Please read our Patient Information Sheet on excessive lymphadenopathy.

What to Do About Large Stages of Unusual Sweating / Fever or Vomiting?

The following is a list of common questions regarding fever, vomiting, excessive sweating, and unexplained bleeding. There are many different factors that contribute to these situations and they can range from simple viral infections through to life threatening illnesses. Your best bet is to contact your healthcare provider right away for advice when faced with these issues.

Fever is a sign of illness. Most often times, however, the reason for fever is unknown at first. This can make things difficult when attempting to diagnose the source of your problem and how to treat it appropriately. It's important to remember that each person reacts differently to certain triggers so it would be wise to consult with someone experienced in diagnosing illness. Many doctors are familiar with these various issues and are able to provide information to help determine what causes them and treatment options are available. A number of medications can assist with controlling both general and acute fevers and help prevent further complications. Other effective solutions include self-medication with anti-inflammatories, vitamins, herbs and herbal supplements. These substances have been found to help reduce fever, relieve pain and promote rest.


It is vital to realize that the vast majority of people who get sick simply don't understand why they're feeling tired or ill. Therefore, if you know that you have been suffering from fever, it","Heavy flaring of the lymph node is due to an abnormal condition called nodular hyperplasia or leukocytosis. This occurs in only 3% of all people with cancer. It has been reported that the majority of patients diagnosed with leukocytosis have advanced tumors (usually liver) but it can occur at any stage of the disease. If you are having a flare, you may be able to use this information to help identify what type of leukocytes are present, how they affect your tumor, how long they last, and their frequency of appearance.

Question: How often do I need to visit my doctor? Complete Answer: No specific answer will be given for each individual patient, as there is no standard recommendation on when or if you should see your primary care physician. The recommendations are based on a number of factors including age, symptoms, and how well your overall health is doing. Your health, along with any past history, current medications, and general habits and lifestyle choices, determines whether or not you need to see your doctors regularly. For example, people who smoke are more likely than others to experience adverse effects from tobacco smoking and have higher risks of developing cancer. People who drink alcohol too much have lower rates of cancer and other diseases and may require fewer visits to the doctor. In addition, the incidence rate of cancers of the mouth, nose, throat, tongue, larynx, jaw, ear, esophagus, bladder, kidney, lung, breast, colon, rectum, stomach, pancreas, prostate, skin and reproductive organs increases as one ages, and the chances of any new cancer increase dramatically with advancing age. Although most Americans never go to the doctor regularly, many do. When you know why you might want to consult a doctor, your family physician, your pediatrician, or another health professional such as a dentist, you can begin to plan your next appointments. For many patients, getting good health advice has become especially important because many people with cancer face additional challenges during or after treatment.

Medical Specialties & Medical Education

Question: What is a medical school curriculum? Complete Answer: A full range of specializations is available by way of the MD, DO, DDS, MSc, MA, BS, BA, etc. Most schools also offer residency programs which provide training in certain specialties. Many medical students choose between an undergraduate program and residency","This is an important question that will help you answer the following two questions (in order):

1) Are your symptoms of flareups related to radiation exposure? If so, how many times have you had these types of attacks and when did they start? Have you ever been diagnosed with cancer or other disorders due to such radiation exposure? Do you know any people who have developed similar problems after being exposed to high levels of radiation? 2) How many days before these flare-ups do you feel tired, lightheaded, short of breath, pale, or cough up blood? Did you experience headaches, muscle cramps, stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, dizziness, loss of appetite, or sleeplessness during the flare-up? Complete Answers: \nTo get the most accurate information on your medical conditions, it is critical to obtain a thorough medical history. This information should include the names and addresses of all family members in your household and may be obtained from your doctors or nurse practitioner. You can also ask your doctor if there is any history of chronic disease, medications, alcohol use, smoking, or pregnancy.\nIf your doctor says there is no current history of illness, he or she also has an obligation to inform you that if you continue to have symptoms consistent with these exposures, consult with your physician regarding treatment options for your condition.\nThe following medical tests should not be missed because they identify radiation-related illnesses: The bone marrow count should be checked periodically for abnormalities and then again at regular intervals as needed until a response occurs. The thyroid gland also needs to be checked frequently. A physical examination that includes palpation of both arms and legs must occur within 24 hours of exposure.\nFor those with a history of cancer or a prior diagnosis, further testing, including CT scans, MRIs, or ultrasound imaging, is recommended.\nFor information about finding out more about radiation-induced diseases, contact your local Radiation Emergency Department (REED), which is located in the emergency room (E.R.) nearest you. Your provider could refer you to one of several specialty centers for specific advice concerning radiation exposure and what symptoms might be associated with each type of injury or injury. For example, patients with brain tumor treatments may see an MRI or a CT scan. Patients with multiple sclerosis may undergo spinal taps and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

How to Avoid Exposure to Radioactive Materials

There are many ways you can avoid potentially dangerous radiation exposures and maintain a safe environment around your home","Heavy or frequent flaring of the skin and/or nasal passages can be due to several causes, including an overactive immune system; inflammation of the adrenal glands, which produces excessive amounts of cortisol (the stress hormone) in response to trauma such as childbirth or injury; and allergies, asthma, and inflammatory bowel diseases that can result from prolonged exposure to chemicals (such as pesticides).\nQuestion: how many people have heart problems? Complete Answer: An estimated 15% of adults will suffer some kind of heart problem at one point in their lives; however, most of these conditions eventually resolve on their own and there is no known cause for heart disease. In addition, up to 90% of all heart attacks occur during the first four years after menopause and women who start smoking before age 40 are more than twice as likely as non-smokers to develop heart failure at any time. \nQuestion: what's wrong with my baby? Complete Answer: There are two primary reasons why your child might not thrive in early life:

1) The mother was exposed to toxic substances by her diet, causing an increase in thyroid hormones, which may lead to infertility or other problems 2) Your infant has had surgery to correct birth defects. This may also lead to issues related to poor nutrition, especially if this type of operation occurs soon after birth. You should speak with your doctor before making major decisions concerning your child. \nQuestion: How does pregnancy work? Complete Answer: The human body begins to form a fertilized egg at approximately 17 weeks. After implantation, it takes only six days for the embryo to reach its full size, which happens when it's born through a small hole in the wall of the uterus. During the next few weeks, you'll experience an intense series of contractions and contractions will continue until delivery. At this point, a placenta attaches to the uterine wall and becomes attached to the developing fetus. Within three months, the fetus is ready to expel the amniotic sac, which provides oxygen to the pregnant woman. To make matters worse, the fetus cannot fully absorb nutrients from the maternal blood stream without also absorbing them from the umbilical cord. The resulting low birth weight results in high rates of preterm labor and premature birth.

To sum up, just like all of us, each new parent experiences challenges along the way and sometimes things go badly (just like they do in our day-to-day lives!). If you're feeling overwhelmed because you haven't found the","Heavy flaring of the lymph nodes occurs when there is inflammation around their edges that is caused by an immune system response. The area may also swell in size during periods of severe illness or stress, including pregnancy, childbirth, or a traumatic injury.\n

In order for it to be life threatening or even fatal, a flare needs to occur within 30 minutes to 2 hours after exposure. Sometimes, however, symptoms appear more than 24 hours later. \nYour information will help patients better understand and manage this condition so they can reduce the chances of serious complications. Your service is important in helping people make informed decisions regarding treatment options, as well as improving patient outcomes.

A study published in 2010 in the journal ""Medicine"" found that consuming between one and two cups per day of raw or cooked spinach may improve blood sugar levels, reduce cholesterol levels, reduce triglycerides and even lower blood pressure.\nQuestion: What does ""fever-reducing"" mean?\nA: Fever-reducing means that your body's natural anti-inflammatory properties can keep you feeling healthy and better after fever days. These are days where your immune system has been compromised (due to infections, allergies, etc.) and your body goes into overdrive to fight off infections. The body uses its own body's immune response to try to protect itself against infection. However, if this process is not balanced, you could experience a weakened immune system. You might feel tired or nauseous. Your body will also produce antibodies to battle the infection. If your immune system is still weak, you would have to use drugs like steroids or antibiotics to treat the infection.\nQuestion: What do I take while taking acetaminophen?\nAnswer: Acetaminophen is used to relieve heat and pain in many situations, such as when you're sick, working out, swimming, bathing, playing sports, etc. To see how acetaminophen works in each situation, check out this article on myHealthWeb.com.

Complete Answer: this one is actually difficult to answer because it varies wildly with the market. My personal favourite is Neutrogena's Active Moisturizer for Dry Skin. The problem is that there is very little information available online about it. \nQuestion: how long do I have before my skin starts discolouring from over-exfoliation? Complete Answer: It depends on your skin type but generally the sooner the better. You should not apply excessive amounts of products as they tend to irritate or burn your face and eyelids. \nQuestion: What kind of masks should I use when applying sunscreen? Complete Answer: If you want something strong enough to shield your sensitive skin from the sun, then I would say try a mask made from natural ingredients such as aloe vera gel or coconut water.

Other options include using glycerin-based masks (like this Aloe Vera Glycerine Mask) which don't contain harmful chemicals, or even just plain old moisturiser. \nQuestion: How does parabens affect my skin? Complete Answer: Parabens are used in some cosmetics to protect the surface from the damaging effects of UV radiation. However, studies show that people who are exposed to certain types of parabens, especially those found naturally in foods, may experience increased risk of skin cancer. Studies also suggest that paraben exposure may cause changes to the way our DNA works, so if you're concerned about your skin and want to reduce its exposure to parabens, make sure you avoid foods high in parabens (such as white bread). In addition, consider using paraben-free cleansers, sunscreens and anti-aging creams to help prevent any further damage. \nQuestion: What is a vitamin D3 supplement? Complete Answer: Vitamin D3 supplements are usually sold as capsules containing a synthetic version of the hormone. They're often marketed as being an effective way to boost your levels. There isn't much evidence that they work though, either in terms of helping improve your health or improving the appearance of your skin.

RAW Paste Data

I'm not sure if this list would help anyone with an actual medical question. (If so, please let me know.) However, if you're interested in helping people find out more about their illness, here's a few things you might consider doing in addition to just listing everything that exists in the public domain. 1) Look up ""medical"" and try to remember which definitions of that word exist within each medical discipline -- e.g., can someone who has been treated by a doctor receive treatment at home? If so, then go ahead and use the definitions as defined by the American Medical Association. 2) Consider sending in questions via email, rather than using one of the mailing lists listed above. 3) Do you know whether your condition can be cured by herbs? 4) If you're looking for a specific kind of herbal remedy, read the label carefully -- it may contain many different plants and herbs that are used for different purposes. 5) If you've ever felt like your symptoms were getting worse after you ate certain foods, you probably shouldn't eat those foods anymore. 6) Consider buying a supplement; take one if necessary. These supplements may work better for you than prescription medications for all sorts of reasons. For example, taking probiotics could help prevent bacterial infections. If you're concerned about your intestinal gas and bloating","Eczema is caused by the allergic reaction of skin cells that is triggered by bacteria or viruses. It's very common on children who eat foods containing food-borne pathogens such as eggs or nuts. If you get eczema from eating raw fruits or vegetables then it could be a sign of an allergy. Symptoms of an allergy include hives, swelling, redness, pain, red eyes, runny nose, swollen lymph nodes, wheezing, difficulty breathing, coughing up blood, vomiting, diarrhea, and sometimes even death. In addition, some people with eczema may experience anaphylactic shock when they inhale pollen in the air. The best thing to do if you suspect your child has eczema is to take him or her to the doctor right away. You can also use this information to guide you through the proper treatment for your child.

In general, the more severe symptoms you have, the less likely your child will be exposed to food-borne pathogens. When it comes to allergies, however, there is no one correct way to diagnose them. As adults we develop tolerance and sensitivity to certain allergens. This means that our bodies become less sensitive to specific allergens than at any other time in our lives; therefore, some of us have a greater potential risk of getting these kinds of allergies than others. Therefore, although it is important to know the type of reactions your child may be experiencing to avoid exposing yourself, it is not always necessary. For example, some people may react more strongly to foods because they were born with a predisposition to intolerance to particular proteins in food.

Sometimes when someone gets sick, he or she becomes hypersensitive to another substance in his or her body—such as something in the water in which he or she was swimming. Because this can occur suddenly and without warning, someone who has been hospitalized can't tell you how much hypersensitivity might be happening to him or her. While most people with hypersensitivity to chemicals or foreign substances have no symptoms, some cases can result in a life-threatening event. In those cases, doctors must determine whether the person should receive emergency care. In order to prevent this, keep things like swimming pools clean and change out of rags or swimsuits after you go swimming.

If you think your child has eczema, ask your pediatrician questions about the triggers that are causing the symptoms. Ask about your child's activities over the past few weeks, including the food he or she eats, what medications he or she","You do not have eczema. It's not normal, but you can be healthy, even if it does not look like eczema. \NQuestion: what is the most important thing for me to know before I get my first prescription drug? Complete Answer: You should always read your doctor's instructions carefully because some drugs may need a different regimen than others. The information below will help you decide which medication may work best for you in terms of side effects. You should also keep in mind that other factors may play a role as well, such as allergies, blood sugar levels, and medications taken by yourself or under the supervision of an experienced healthcare professional. The following list provides general guidelines on how to properly prescribe your specific medicine(s).\n Question: What is the best way to prevent cancer? Complete Answer: The safest course of action is to avoid smoking, drinking alcohol, using illicit drugs, and taking other harmful habits. Tobacco use will kill approximately 80% of people who start smoking. Drink less than two drinks per day, so that you don't become dehydrated from overconsumption. If you smoke, quit!

Drink one to three glasses of water a day. Avoid alcoholic beverages completely unless they come with a ""no-tobacco"" warning label. Alcohol causes more damage to the liver than any other toxin. Drinking alcohol increases heart rate and respiration rates, which can cause problems for those at risk for diabetes. In addition, alcohol stimulates the release of growth hormone, which has been shown to increase the chance of developing prostate cancer. In addition, the increased appetite caused by alcohol can result in overeating and weight gain. \NQuestion: Why is it so hard for men to lose weight without losing their manhood? Complete Answer: Women's bodies produce hormones called estrogen and progesterone that influence the development of breast tissue and uterine lining. When these hormones are out of balance, the breasts develop larger than usual in women. While there isn't conclusive evidence suggesting that estrogen and progesterone levels are related to obesity, they appear to contribute to this problem. Because breast size is influenced by many factors including body fat percentage, age, activity level, and diet, these hormones are often misconstrued as being a major factor in determining how large a woman's breasts are. For example, estrogen is thought to decrease insulin sensitivity through its effect on adipose tissues (fat cells), while progesterone is believed to stimulate cell proliferation in fat cells (prostate cancer, for example)","Yes\n

Why do I get hives?\nAnswer: Hives may occur in response to a virus or bacteria that is causing a problem. The most commonly seen cause of hives, known as anaphylaxis, can be traced back to the inhalation of small amounts of pollen from certain plants (such as grasses) into your lungs. When you have been exposed to these pollen grains in high enough concentrations, they will trigger symptoms such as itching, swelling, redness, and pain in your face, eyes, or mouth. For more information on how to avoid inhaling pollen for the next time it causes a hiccup, see the FDA's advice here. If you are allergic to any of the plant-based products listed below, you should immediately stop using them immediately. \nQuestion: I'm experiencing chronic fatigue with little sleep. Complete Answer: You probably suffer from fibromyalgia\n

What does it feel like when I have this happen?\nAnswer: It feels like you've gone through a massive heart attack. \nQuestion: I'm suffering from chronic low back pain. Complete Answer: This condition is called spondylolisthesis, which has no name. Spondylolisthesis can result from a number of causes including: trauma, disease, nerve damage, arthritis, and degenerative disc diseases \nQuestion: What makes me think there might be an allergy in my food? Complete Answer: There are some foods in your diet that contain proteins from animals who were fed on farm animals that had not received the proper care and feed when they were born. These include eggs, milk, meat, fish, shellfish, honey, nuts, garlic, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, paprika, oregano, mustard, thyme, parsley, rosemary, thyme, fennel seed, onions, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, walnuts, eggplant, and many others. \nQuestion: How much sun do I need?

They may be suffering from something called erythema multiforme or atopic dermatitis. The skin of someone with eczema tends to develop lesions that look like bumps or rashes on their forehead, neck, cheeks, legs, arms, hands, feet, and face (called atypical features). These lesions can also appear elsewhere in the body as well. Although you can't be 100% sure if you've got an allergic reaction, it's quite possible you will.\n\nIf you have eczema, it's probably the result of having too many substances living inside your body that don't belong there, including the following:\n\n• Eczema has nothing to do with allergies.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of eczema are all related to the immune system's response to foreign objects called allergens.\n\nThere are two kinds of allergies:\n\n1. Allergic contact dermatitis\n2. Anaphylaxis.\n\nAllergies to certain things cause itching, redness, swelling, and other symptoms. If you have these kinds of reactions, they're often caused by an overactive immune system. People with eczema usually react more strongly to things that irritate them than to others. For example, they might scratch themselves when they itch. In addition, even small amounts of dirt and oil can trigger an allergic reaction. When the immune system doesn't get enough oxygen, it starts producing chemicals called histamines, which activate the same parts of the brain that produce histamine. Histamines are the key ingredients in food poisoning. That means that when you eat an allergy-causing substance like moldy bread or a piece of burnt butter, you're putting yourself right back at risk for getting sick. Most adults who suffer from eczema have experienced some form of allergic contact dermatitis during childhood. Some children have had serious allergic reactions to things such as nuts, peanuts, and eggs. Your child may need special treatment because he or she has eczema. The type of therapy you choose depends on whether you have a milder or more severe case of eczema.\nQuestion: what causes eczema\nWhat's behind it?\nAnswer:\nPeople with eczema","I have been getting an eczema from time to time in the past few years due to my allergies and acne. However, since I am not allergic to any ingredients (except for milk), it is quite difficult to tell if there is something wrong with me or my skin. The most important thing is that you don't want to do this to anyone else's skin. \end question

Do you think it is safe for your children to be exposed to the chemical? Answer : I am concerned because the research has not yet shown that it will harm people who come into contact with the chemical. In fact, it was found at one site on the internet that some of the chemicals used in these products may help promote skin healing even more. What I can say about this is that I'm not aware of any studies showing what the long term effects might be after prolonged exposure. There also could be other factors that cause an increased risk. For example, as many as 10% of people may develop asthma, but it isn't clear what part of the chemical makes people susceptible. Also, it doesn't seem likely that children would be able to handle such a high level of irritants without developing some kind of respiratory illness. Please be careful when using this product!","A lot of people get eczema from stress. Stress is one of the most important causes for eczema, and stress in general can be harmful for you. Some ways that stress can cause your skin to get infected are: poor diet

tension between your legs

unhealthy exercise habits

work or school schedules \nQuestion: if I have allergies to peanuts and tree nuts \nHow long does it take for me to become allergic? Complete Answer: The longer you've been exposed to allergens like trees and peanuts, the more likely you will develop an allergy. For example, there's no need to wait until a child has asthma to start taking asthma medicine (some children do develop asthma as early as age 4). However, not all children with allergies eventually develop an allergy, so it's best to let your doctor know when you notice symptoms of an allergic reaction (such as hives or runny nose) or notice a change in your symptoms (for example, fever). After your doctor determines whether you're at risk of developing an allergy, he or she may prescribe medication (called an antihistamine, cortisone, etc.) to help prevent severe allergic reactions. As with other conditions, some medicines work by blocking specific receptors on your body, but many others affect both the immune system and the body as a whole. It takes time for these changes to take effect, though, and your ability to fight off allergies should gradually improve over time. To find out more about how to treat eczema, visit our eczema page. In addition to providing medical information related to the condition, this website also offers educational resources, including: how to read labels (such as peanut and tree nut warnings)

how to identify and avoid foods that trigger your eczema","The short answer is that some people get the infection from their skin, but most of us have it in our airways, and there's no single treatment for it. If you feel symptoms like eczema, call your doctor. \nThe longer answer is more complicated and depends on several factors, such as how frequently you've had eczema, how much time has passed since it first happened, whether you'd been exposed to specific allergens, and what your history of allergies might be. For example, an allergy to mold or pollen can cause allergic asthma, which means it affects the lungs too. And if you're prone to hay fever and other viral infections, your doctor may want to check your immune system. In general, though, you should not have severe or ongoing pain without having received appropriate medical care within the past 2 weeks.

Getting inaccurate information

If you've used any of the forms above before, you'll probably know that you get accurate responses when you simply provide your name and address. But sometimes, you get incorrect results because your information didn't match up with what was typed into the ""your"" field. To avoid this situation, take the following steps:

Step 1: Make sure the email addresses you entered appear exactly as they appeared on your voter registration card.


This step is important, because the county will typically require you to retype your address after each update.


For example:


John Smith <john@example.com>

Mary Smith <mary@example.com>

So I got my mail at 10:30 this morning. Do you live at 1511 West Broad St.?

You need to make sure your address appears exactly as it appears on your voter registration card. Sometimes, the voter registration application does not include your current address, so you must input your new address manually. For example, to correctly enter your current home address, type it in exactly as it appears on your voter registration card. This way, you'll see exactly where you are on the voter registration"

When it comes down to it, there is a lot of misinformation surrounding fluoridation programs. As we discussed in an earlier article, the CDC has admitted they did not conduct any studies regarding their anti-fluoride campaign before instituting it. Instead, they relied upon ""independent"" scientists who were paid by the pharmaceutical industry. A recent study conducted by the University of Rochester found that there was a strong link between fluoridated drinking water and autism in children born after 1984 - this time when children were less likely to receive these vaccinations.

Some people with hard teeth can easily scratch their tongue due to their natural inability to reach any deep in the bone without pushing down. Tooth enamel has special cells called keratinocytes (the same ones that make fingernails) that help keep these cells in check. When there's too much of an amount of keratin in your mouth from bad habits or a hard period, it starts cracking. This causes a cavity to form on the inside of your gums.

The reason why you need to learn to chew properly in order to avoid this problem is because if your gums crack too far into your body, they will cause infections and bleeding. In addition, they'll also make it harder to get the food out of your stomach quickly. \nQuestion: Can I stop my tooth decay by brushing every day? Complete Answer: Yes!

There is an article on your site entitled ""Wisdom Teeth Removal"" (http://www.whomishelp.com/wisdom_teeth/) which provides more information than I can explain here. The answer below provides some background information that will help you make informed decisions when choosing between two similar dental procedures. A recent study was done by Dr. Martin Berkowitz, MD, and his colleagues, who found that one of the most common causes of severe gum disease is the removal of hard enamel with the use of a wisdom tooth extractor. This procedure removes the entire tooth and results in a permanent dentin layer. The root canal is then done to remove any remaining bone marrow or other debris from the affected area. It should be noted that there is no evidence of tooth loss after the procedure. The research was done on over 1,000 patients who had undergone at least one wisdom tooth extraction. Although the researchers were unable to conclude anything definitive about its efficacy, they did find that the wisdom teeth extracted reduced symptoms such as pain, swelling, gingivitis and periodontal infections. They also found that the wisdom teeth removed showed improved general oral health, but these improvements did not last long enough to eliminate the need for a second wisdom tooth extraction. In summary, the results suggested that the wisdom tooth extractor was effective in reducing gum disease; however, if you choose to go ahead with the surgery, it is important to note that the technique does have drawbacks; however, they do seem minor in comparison to those of the conventional wisdom tooth extraction. \end quote}

So how many times have you seen someone say something like ""I've never heard of a prescription for a wisdom tooth extractor""? Well, let's take a look at the facts to see what we're talking about...

What is a Wisdom Tooth Extractor?

A wisdom tooth extractor is simply another way of removing a hard enamel layer with a combination of techniques. When all else fails, a traditional wisdom tooth extraction may result in decay. However, the effectiveness of a wisdom tooth extractor depends upon several factors. First of all, there must be some type of base material underneath the hardened enamel layer -- otherwise, there would be no point in extracting it. Secondly, the extraction method must provide sufficient pressure to maintain the integrity of the hardened enamel layer. And finally, if the extraction is performed correctly, there is usually a significant amount of","The Wisdom Teeth® were developed as a tool for the dentists and other oral healthcare professionals to provide accurate information on the teeth of their patients.

Gum disease is usually caused by bacteria or fungi that grow on plaque on the surface of your teeth. These bacteria cause lesions in between the layers of enamel, causing inflammation or bleeding and eventually resulting in permanent damage.\nIf you think someone may have gum disease, ask them if they ever had any of these symptoms before their toothache started:\nPain during dental procedures Pain when brushing Your gums hurt sometimes You feel like you have to chew Gum pain hurts more than usual You get some redness or other discomfort when chewing Gum pain makes it hard for you to swallow Toothache is often caused by plaque that has formed behind the root of the tooth (the tooth's crown) The tooth was pulled out too soon The dentures were put too far forward Pain from painful clenching Your tongue feels funny Sometimes your tongue gets dry You get cold spots on your tongue If there is no pain after several weeks, talk to your dentist to see what is wrong.

A Guide To A Healthy Mouth:","The tooth is located in the root of your upper jawbone and can be seen with an x-ray or dentist's mirror. It is made up of a layer of enamel between two layers of calcium phosphate. Gum disease usually results from eating too much sugar or refined carbohydrate products such as white flour or potato chips that contain glucose. Tooth decay occurs when bacteria within the mouth, especially plaque, cause the teeth to become discolored. A tooth cannot heal itself by becoming soft. If you have cavities, you may want to ask your dental hygienist for help. Your dentist will explain what can go wrong with your smile (lack of breathability) or lack of bite. You might also consider having your teeth examined at a private dental office if there is not someone near you who has experience using a dental tool.

If you already know how to correct problem conditions, you'll likely find this resource more beneficial than information on natural remedies. But many people have a hard time understanding what causes bad breath and if it is worth treating. Some suggest simply brushing one's teeth every day. Others believe that the only thing needed to make their breath smell better is removing the carbon dioxide produced by smoking cigarettes. In any case, most dentists recommend brushing once or twice daily. When we talk about preventing tooth decay, we're talking about maintaining good oral hygiene. For example, use fluoride mouthwashes and rinse your hands thoroughly after bathing. If you brush your teeth regularly, they should stay cleaner longer.

What Can I Do?

The best prevention method is brushing well. Regularly brushing your teeth helps prevent plaque buildup, which makes your breath odorous and difficult to breathe through.

Some types of caries (dentures) can get worse without treatment. If you notice that you need additional care to keep your teeth healthy, see your dentist to discuss options. Remember that dentists offer many treatments that can improve your overall health.

Common Questions and Answers about the Internet

What do you mean when you say that the internet is ""a place where all information is free?"" What does it mean?

Internet sites provide an abundance of information for consumers. There are many different types of web pages available on the Internet that help individuals find information about their health and well being. Consumers can find any type of content by searching on the appropriate keywords.

Do I need to have a computer or smartphone with me at the dentist's office? How often should I check up on my teeth and gums?

The dental office requires each patient to present his/her own personal digital device (smartphone) and access the Internet from that device. As a result, most patients use a smartphone and/or tablet when they visit the doctor's office and stay connected through the Internet. The following questions address these questions.

How frequently should I check up on my teeth and gums?

This question asks how often your dentist would like you to check up on your teeth and gums. If your dentist recommends checking every two weeks, then he/she probably wants to see what you are eating, drinking, smoking, using drugs, stress, medications, or other physical conditions as potential causes of poor oral hygiene.

Are there some things I shouldn't eat while I'm having my teeth cleaned?

While you're checking your teeth and gums, don't forget about food allergies. Many people are allergic to certain foods such as peanuts, tree nuts, dairy products, wheat germ, eggs, seafood, soy products, beans, grains, and legumes. These foods contain chemicals called phytoestrogens which may affect your oral hygiene and overall health. You might also wish to avoid alcohol, cigarettes, caffeine, sugar, fatty foods, and other unhealthy foods.

Which diseases have been linked to diet? Which diseases have not been linked to diet? Why haven't these diseases been associated with diet? Do diets cause disease? Does a healthy diet cause disease? Which diseases have been linked to lack of exercise? Which diseases have not been linked to lack of exercise?

There has been little research into the link between diet and chronic diseases. However, over the past decade, numerous studies have demonstrated links between obesity, high blood pressure, heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, and more to poor nutrition. Obesity is considered a major public health problem because increased calorie consumption leads to weight","There is no difference in the effect of oral acetic acid compared with water on the pH of the saliva of healthy adults when they chew and swallow. The pH of mouthwash or a toothpaste that contains vinegar has an acidic pH level of 3.0 to 5.4; those containing citric acid have an alkaline pH of 1.5 to 2.6. This means that some people can tolerate more salt than others. Some sources say that patients who take a high dose of vinegar may experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, or loss of appetite; however, there is no evidence for these effects in humans.

If you feel like it is going to be a problem, call your doctor so that they can order more medication.\nQuestion: pain relief\nComplete Answer: To relieve the aches and pains in your joints, you may want to try ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) 10mg to 20mg tablets twice daily for 3 days before taking an injection of acetaminophen (Tylenol). A combination of acetaminophen and aspirin (Aracil, Tums, Aleve) should work well. The best dose for patients with acute pain is 25mg to 50mg once every 8 hours. If you experience pain at night, you may increase the dose to 50mg three times every 4 hours until bedtime. Do not give acetaminophen to children under 12 months old because it has been shown to slow their growth. Give only when the person with arthritis says that he/she cannot tolerate it anymore and there is no other treatment available. For chronic conditions that require frequent injections, there are several options, including: -Medication called Arvin (Vitamix)

-A local injection for ulcers (Penicillin G, Micronase)

-Pediapine (Aleve) For chronic conditions that don't require frequent injections, you might consider: -Injectable anti inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium and others

-Surgery for osteoarthritis

-Surgical implantation of a prosthesis, including a pacemaker or a valve replacement that moves blood from one part of the body to another

-Infusion of insulin to help control blood glucose levels

-Intravenous immunoglobulin for type 1 diabetes

-Surgery to remove bone marrow cells and replace them with stem cells and stem cell transplants For severe cases, you may prefer to go without any treatment altogether.

If you have symptoms of either type, it is very likely that the cause is inattention rather than an underlying mental disorder. For example, a person with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may also suffer from mood changes such as depression or irritability. The most important thing to know about treating ADHD symptoms is that they can occur without any awareness of their severity. While many parents of children with ADHD report that their child's behavior does improve after taking medications for at least five years, others do not believe that medication treatment has made a difference. In fact, some people with ADHD even prefer not to take stimulants, claiming that they just don't work. It is difficult to determine whether this belief stems from a lack of scientific evidence or an unwillingness to listen to advice on how to treat their symptoms. If you or someone you love has ADHD, please contact us.","The two most common causes of ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) in children are poor diet and exposure to chemicals. There is no cure for either. If you have been diagnosed with one or both of these conditions, try to avoid caffeine on the day your symptoms begin. This can help reduce symptoms by reducing the amount of the drug that needs to be taken. It is also recommended that you do not take any medications containing diuretics such as methotrexate, sulfa drugs, calcium channel blockers, corticosteroids, etc. or any medication that increases urination during pregnancy or if you are breastfeeding. Other reasons why taking certain medicines may worsen symptoms include: excessive sedation and lack of coordination

excessive drowsiness

high blood pressure

irregular heartbeat

lack of attention or concentration","If you are concerned with the symptoms that accompany ADHD medication use or mental problems such as depression, anxiety, hostility, or restlessness, seek help from your doctor and/or other qualified health care provider. Ask for information on medications that may be prescribed by your physician if you have any questions regarding your symptoms. The American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry recommends that children (ages 6 months through 17 years) receive a minimum of 400 mg of norepinephrine per day (e.g., Dexedrine) along with 1–2 micrograms of lithium daily (e.g., Lithium Iodide). Children under 18 who do not meet this recommendation should also receive at least 400 mg of norepinephrine per day (e.g., Dexedrine) along with 2 micrograms of lithium. See http://www.childandadolescentsmedicine.org/downloads/ADHD_FactSheets_5thEdition.pdf for more details. For people age 12 and over, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests taking an average of 250 mg of ephedrine twice a day (e.g., EpiPen®), which can provide emergency doses when needed. \nIf you are concerned about the severity of your mental illness, ask your doctor or other trained professional about possible treatment options. In addition, consult with a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist before starting or stopping treatment.

The first type is characterized by symptoms that develop gradually and are not relieved or corrected with treatment; the second type is characterized by an acute onset of symptoms followed by remission but subsequent relapse. To be considered AAD, patients must meet certain criteria. In both cases, patients may have comorbid psychiatric conditions such as mood disorders and substance abuse, which can interfere with medications, including those prescribed for ADHD. These conditions can also complicate the management of these symptoms.\n\n

Common Questions About ADHD \n

Answer: I don't think I am in the DSM-IV class. However, when someone has multiple diagnoses, they will often refer to their primary diagnosis in this answer. For example, if you were diagnosed with AAD and had a secondary diagnosis of bipolar disorder, then your primary diagnosis would include Bipolar Disorder. And even if you are now on medication, you might still need to take some additional tests before being able to be referred to the appropriate specialist. So, this question only applies to people who have been diagnosed with AAD.\n

Question: How do you get into the ""psychiatrist"" category?\nThe most important way that you can qualify is the fact that many doctors, including psychiatrists, feel that ADHD sufferers are self-medicating (self-treating), which can lead to depression or other mental illnesses. They believe that this behavior causes these behaviors to continue while there is no real cause. This belief makes it difficult to provide effective care. Many psychiatrists also feel that some patients with AAD have very high levels of impulsivity (as well as a general lack of focus). These patients tend to act quickly and without thinking, causing problems in social interactions and work.\n

Answer: The best evidence suggests that when adults are treated for ADHD, the underlying condition is actually better managed by treating the underlying cause rather than acting on what is seen as inappropriate behavior by the person. That's why we use the term ""overactive/inattentive."" That means that the problem should not be treated because it produces a symptom (such as hyperactivity) that does not exist until the person becomes overactive. It is easy for adults with ADHD to become frustrated with what is viewed as inappropriate behavior - so many parents report that if their child seems to have difficulties at school, there is no reason that he or she shouldn't be punished instead","I have both of these conditions (anxiety disorder and ADHD) so they are often confused.

However, I would recommend reading up on your particular condition before posting.


I can't stress enough that it is much better to be wrong than to make something up. The web is full of people who want to share what they know with people without first doing their homework. Please be careful before making claims like ""my doctor told me"". In fact, when you read the information provided by websites, be sure to check out the references they include. For instance, if the site says ""I found this website"", please take note of where they got the information (eg, Wikipedia). If they say they used an internet reference, then ask yourself if that source could also easily be edited into a misleading message. Asking questions and reading information about yourself is part of your job as a medical educator! Don't try to tell other people how to treat themselves. Ask them for help instead. Just because someone has good advice doesn't mean you should follow their advice. This goes double if you write about your own situation. If you post anything that makes people think you actually believe it is true, you may end up damaging your credibility even more than you already have. \r

This is so that you can accurately determine if you need any medications to help treat your condition. A medical doctor has determined your blood pressure based on factors such as weight, height, age, sex, race, and body mass index (BMI).\r

When you read your own blood pressure measurement (the Blood Pressure Reading or BP), it should be taken in two parts. One part is your actual reading done by your physician in which he measures the actual drop in your blood pressure. The other part is a special form of testing called an echocardiogram which measures changes in your heart's electrical activity when you have high or low blood pressure. When a patient with high blood pressure takes the test for their first time, they often experience shortness of breath or chest pain as their heart rate increases. After taking the Echocardiograph, the patient may have difficulty breathing but will not show any signs of an abnormal heart rhythm. At home, many people take blood pressure readings from a simple finger stick but this will only give them an inaccurate reading because of small inaccuracies in the needle's tip. The more accurate way of getting a good reading is with an electronic echocardiograph. The Electronic echocardiography is available over the Internet at www.echotronic.org.

An echocardiogram consists of two major components; one is an ultrasound image that shows your heart beating through your skin and another is a pulse oximeter that measures how fast your pulse moves down your arm. It is important to note that both the ultrasound image and pulse oximeter measurements provide a rough estimate of your blood pressure level. There is no way to know exactly what your blood pressure could be if you were taking multiple medications. Therefore, it is very important to obtain multiple readings while taking these different medications. If you wait too long between using the different medications, there is a chance that your readings will be off. You do this by staying awake and paying attention to your heartbeat. If you get a reading higher than normal (over 140) then it would suggest that you may need to lower your dosage of one of the medications. In addition, it is best to keep track of all of your medications since the echocardiogram will allow you to know where your risk for bleeding is. If you decide to use the blood pressure reading method above, here are some suggestions. Take","Medication Adhd Anxiety is the most severe form of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) that can last from 2-5 years in adults. It results when children or adolescents have too much energy and not enough sleep, leading them to be hyperactive in school and on the playgrounds. \nQuestion: What should I do if my child has ADHD? Complete Answer:

Your daughter or son may need some help with their ADHD symptoms. She/he needs to learn how to manage her energy level by staying in control at home, avoiding risky behavior, and learning skills such as time management. Your son may also need advice on how best to keep his emotions under control by making sure he stays calm and focused. They need to also make sure they don't let other people get into their head while they're stressed out. Finally, your son or daughter will want to take a good look around themselves before taking any action they think will cause trouble. Many times we see kids who have ADD/ADHD go through life without noticing how many things could be causing problems for them. This is especially true when it comes to relationships. If you feel the situation is not getting better within your family, seek professional help. You may be able to help your child to become more self-aware, but even then you may not be able to fix this problem until after puberty. At that point, there are some changes in brain chemistry that come with the change in hormones (e.g., testosterone). Some parents worry that a kid's mood might have changed as well because they think that just being around another person makes a difference. That isn't always the case either. There is no way to know for certain what a teen feels or thinks because of their interactions with others. When looking at the big picture, many teens don't act like they were raised differently than everyone else - they simply didn't notice the changes over time. In addition, because of these hormonal changes, teens are going through a period of transition between childhood and adulthood. Because teenagers are still growing, it's often hard to tell if they are dealing with their own issues or they are having issues related to their peers. Sometimes, they find ways to deal with these issues on their own. Other times, they are able to work through it together. To prevent other kids from hurting your child, try to teach him/her healthy coping strategies. For example, talking with your kid about things they can do to stop acting out will usually solve the issue. Another","Adolescents with ADHD show evidence of symptoms of increased stress/anxiety levels such as irritability, mood changes, depression, lethargy, sleep disturbances, or difficulty concentrating. It's important for these patients to take their meds the day after taking them. These medications can lead to side effects such as increased blood pressure, heart problems, or seizures. These drugs may not be appropriate for all children, especially those who have other conditions that make them more likely to experience serious reactions from these medications. Some adults also need to avoid these medications.

Drugs used by adults with ADHD include methylphenidate (Ritalin), amphetamine (Adderall), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), and the antihistamine haloperidol (Haldol). There is no scientific evidence that any of these medications can treat adult ADHD; they simply act as stimulants to help improve behavior in younger children. It's recommended that you ask your doctor about using other medications if you're not sure if your child has an untreated ADHD.

What should I tell my kids before I start treatment?

Children with ADHD do best when treated early in life and during childhood. Children who will not respond to prescription medications due to side effects are usually too young to undergo psychiatric evaluation or even to seek therapy. You could risk losing the attention and support of your children who might otherwise benefit from treatment. So it's critical that you discuss treatment options with your family members and ask what services you can provide. Your pediatrician may suggest that you refer your child to a therapist, psychiatrist, social worker, or school counselor. Even though some research indicates that parents don't receive enough information about treatments available, many families find it convenient to talk openly about any concerns or questions. As long as your child has been diagnosed, you won't want to discourage him or her from seeking treatment.

When can I expect my child to begin treatment?

There are two main stages in the development of ADHD - preadolescent and adolescence. During the initial phase of development, children develop motor skills, language skills, fine motor skills, and problem solving abilities. Once this stage of development ends, children become hyperactive, irritable, and disruptive. In fact, one out of three children who have ADHD develops behavioral disorders over a lifetime.

Your answer is very likely accurate because you have had direct experience with the symptoms described above. The term ""cognitive dysfunction"" was not coined by your doctor but rather refers to the condition known as hyperactivity disorder or ADHD, which has many similar symptoms such as impulsiveness, inattention, distractibility, difficulty focusing, disorganization, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and a decrease in impulse control in children. This is an excellent reason to get help for yourself. There is no cure for ADHD. A thorough medical evaluation by your primary care physician will determine if you should be referred to a specialist or remain on medication. If there is no immediate need for a diagnosis, then you can continue taking your medications at home and avoid having to visit your primary care physician every few months. If the diagnosis of your problem is not urgent, it may take several weeks before you feel that your symptoms improve. In any event, you should start seeing a specialized mental health therapist to treat any current or past psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, mood disorders, eating disorders, and addiction. Your physical health also must improve. As noted above, excessive exercise can increase the concentration of cortisol produced when you eat. Excessive use of alcohol or drugs can also cause high levels of cortisol. Alcohol consumption increases the rate at which cortisol is released from your adrenal glands into circulation. For this reason, people who drink large amounts of alcohol frequently during their lives are at greater risk for hypoglycemia, which decreases blood sugar levels resulting in low energy and loss of coordination. If you begin using prescription stimulants while under treatment for a mental illness, they may worsen these symptoms, making it more difficult for you to manage them effectively.","The primary cause of myocardial infarction is the accumulation of plaque in the coronary arteries and the resulting blockage. When plaque accumulates in the coronary artery, the abnormal function of the blood vessels causes the heart to be unable to pump blood throughout the body because the electrical impulses have been blocked by the buildup of plaque. The resulting arrhythmia can lead to irregular heartbeat, dizziness, fainting spells, nausea, vomiting, weakness, abdominal pain, and fatigue. \end{question}

(3) What is the difference between an acute and a chronic heart attack? Is it better to get tested at one time or to keep having these tests done until you're diagnosed?

Answer: It's important to differentiate between what happens during the initial symptoms (e.g., chest pain), which may mimic a stroke or other condition, and the later effects that may include the following:

1. Short-Term Symptoms: In a stroke, the affected part of the brain is damaged and it begins to die off. Thereafter, symptoms such as headaches, muscle twitching, and feeling lightheaded come and go. In this situation, no treatment will help your symptom. However, if there is something wrong with the functioning of the heart system, the immediate symptoms will likely improve after some time has passed.

2. Chronic Heart Attack: A chronic heart attack occurs when the heart tissue stops working properly, so that the abnormal flow of blood through the body causes problems like high blood pressure, dizziness, fainting spells, numbness, confusion, or hallucinations. With prolonged treatment, many patients feel able to return to their normal lives with little or no ill effects from having had a heart attack. However, this type of heart disease does not usually progress into a full-blown heart attack, but rather progresses along a series of stages where it becomes more severe and is often followed by death.

If you develop chest pain while taking certain medications for diabetes, the most reliable way to tell if the medication is causing heart trouble is whether your patient reports having pains in his chest (hearing, fluttering, trembling, chest tightness, pain coming from below the neck) after drinking a large amount of alcohol. If he or she experiences similar sensations, then the medicine is probably not helping.

The best advice for anyone considering taking any kind of drug or supplement is to consult a physician who is experienced with drugs and supplements before beginning anything new.

Answer: The cause of this condition is not known. However, some parents believe that this is related to certain foods in their children's diet. If your child has an eating disorder, you may want to consult a doctor or nurse before making any changes in their diet.\nQuestion: What happens if I feed my child too much milk? Answer: Milk is often considered an ideal food for babies. When you first give your baby milk, you should be careful to make sure he/she has enough calcium. Calcium, as well as vitamin D, is required for healthy growth and development. You may need to increase the amount of calcium given, but you must do so slowly to avoid causing nutrient deficiencies. Most people prefer to drink only water when they start feeding their infants. This helps them get more nutrients from the infant formula they consume. After two weeks of regular breast milk consumption, most children will become accustomed to drinking breast milk (not formula) from time to time. If you want to use formula, you should always provide your baby with the same quantity of breast milk every day, regardless of how often you fed him/her. Do not allow your infant to become ""fed"" on solid foods. Even if your infant eats a little bit of solid food each time you visit him/her, you should never force her to eat solid foods. This is especially true after a meal, because solid foods contain protein and fat which are important for proper growth. Keep in mind, however, that there is no scientific evidence that infant formulas contain less than what is found in breast milk. In fact, research shows that breast milk contains more of these nutrients, and a baby who drinks cow's milk may develop different developmental disorders as a result. Breast milk also contains a higher percentage of essential fatty acids, vitamins A, E, B6, B12, D and K, magnesium, potassium, and zinc. This information does not take into account the addition of synthetic ingredients. For example, soybean oil may increase the level of sodium in breast milk, while whey protein increases calcium intake. Be aware of all of the differences between breast milk and formula!

Answer: Lact",This information is not applicable to you or your child.,"The most effective way to help people who have chronic diarrhea is to address their underlying causes of the problem.

A: The first thing you need to do when changing your diapers is to wash the baby's bottom (which means using a wet/dry method). Once your baby is dry, put him into his carrier and sit down on the floor in an upright position with both legs together so he cannot turn around while you are changing his diaper. You will probably get more upset than usual at this point, but don't worry – you won't hurt yourself! It really isn't very hard to do and it's much less messy than putting the baby on the back with his feet up and away from you. Put the cover back over the baby and repeat until your baby becomes accustomed to sitting still and avoiding turning. If you're not comfortable changing your baby by himself, try placing him in another room with a parent (or a friend) to help him settle. In the meantime, use the cover on the carrier instead of wiping yourself with cold water. If you want your baby to sleep through the night and enjoy the rest of the day, then you must also give him the opportunity to nurse. The reason why you see mothers taking their babies out for a walk when they start breastfeeding is because they think it helps them sleep better. To keep a bottle warm, hold the breast under your arm rather than using your fingers. This allows you to stay warm without having to run your hands all over the bottle. For more information on nursing at home, visit our Parenting page. In general, you should NEVER feed your infant by hand, even if you know how to properly wash your hands. That said, there is nothing wrong with doing something like rubbing a breast pad or dabbing some petroleum jelly on your nipple during feeding if you feel it works better than pumping. Your baby's natural milk producing ability also plays an important role in helping him absorb nutrition throughout the day, especially if he's hungry. Many moms report that they can easily recover from a bad diaper change by just changing their clothing and putting their new clothes on before going shopping or being with someone else.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that adults ages 18 years and older should receive at least 75 percent of their calories from carbohydrates, 30 percent from fat, 20 percent from protein, and 15 percent from complex carbohydrates such as simple sugars, starches, and starchy carbs like white rice, breads, pastas, potatoes, and cornbread. That means they should consume 2,000 calories daily, excluding beverages. Adults with type 1 diabetes who have not achieved glycemic control (normal blood sugar levels) are at greater risk of developing high blood pressure because their bodies cannot effectively use sugar for energy. Type 1 diabetics are more likely than normal-weight people to develop obesity, so it can be very challenging to lose weight when one has diabetes. It may also mean that individuals with diabetes may be overweight even if they do not have metabolic syndrome or other signs and symptoms associated with being obese. In addition, individuals with diabetes need to monitor their diet closely due to the increased risks associated with overeating. The key to managing any condition is to get help as early as possible and keep a close eye on yourself throughout the day.

Chronic Diarrhea

A person who has been infected with HIV may get more severe bouts of diarrhea in the future. It's also known as AIDS. People who have had one bout of AIDS will generally never get another, even if they do receive treatment. If you've already received treatment for HIV, you're no longer contagious for HIV. However, there may still be some people who could become exposed. These individuals should receive appropriate care, such as testing for hepatitis B and C before getting tested again.

People often report getting worse after having recently experienced a bout of diarrhea. This does not necessarily mean they contracted diarrhea because it may have been caused by their viral infection, but rather that they began experiencing symptoms of diarrhea at a later date and then continued to experience them during their next bout of diarrhea. For example, a woman may start having bad cramps right after she has been diagnosed with HIV, and her cramping may persist for weeks. After several weeks, the cramps subside, leaving the woman feeling ""normal,"" as though nothing happened. But this is simply false. She has now developed a new and very serious disease—cholera—which requires immediate attention.

So what is the difference between a bout of diarrhea and a cholera outbreak? You'll need to check with your doctor to find out. Once you find out the answer, call your doctor immediately. He/she might refer you to your local Public Health Department office for further evaluation.

Answer


Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is caused by abnormal development of the thymus gland in children whose parents have certain forms of hereditary thymic hyperplasia or thymic insufficiency, often due to inherited diseases. In those cases, thymocytes produce excessive amounts of the hormone TSH, which increases blood clotting in the body. As a result of these changes, the Thymus becomes enlarged and congested. The swelling creates additional difficulties in growth, particularly in infants and young children.

How do I know if I'm taking an opioid? Answer: As a general rule, opioids will not be prescribed for patients with kidney disease unless it is medically contraindicated. The FDA has classified many opioids as ""unsafe"" medications because they may adversely affect other organ systems (e.g., liver). If you're on these medications, ask your doctor whether you should stop taking them, especially if you experience kidney problems from long-term use. A patient who experiences symptoms such as thirst, increased urination, decreased appetite or changes in bowel habits while using long-term opioid therapy may need to stop taking the medication. It is best to discuss this issue with your provider first. This question was originally answered by Dr. H. David Mays in 2015. We apologize for any confusion caused by the change of information.

The most commonly prescribed treatment option for ME/CFS is intravenous methylprednisolone. For melecellular disorders, the standard treatment is daily oral prednisone. There is no evidence that patients with ME/CFS can benefit from taking methylprednisolone at any time in the past year. Patients should discuss treatment options with their physician before starting a new regimen or switching medications.

Because there is no effective treatment available for ME/CFS, many people consider the disease to have a progressive disability with worsening function as symptoms worsen over time. This was true of my father's disease, although he did live for decades without further improvement. People who don't think they will improve often seek out alternative therapies to help them cope with the disease and its side effects. For example, many use massage, acupuncture, exercise, chiropractic, yoga, herbs, meditation, etc. These treatments, though they might initially seem beneficial, cause unwanted side effects. They do not provide much control over the disease, so many choose to go on a different medication regimen instead. As long as the person continues to take a certain amount of medication, the symptoms will eventually subside on their own. Therefore, if you have ME/CFS, ask your doctor or pharmacist about other treatments that might help you deal with your condition. Your physician could prescribe a variety of new drugs to treat the illness.

You need to try other things first such as eating more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and lower fat dairy products. You may also consider a low dose norethisterone and/or a vitamin D supplement (Vitamin D can be obtained from sun exposure).

My throat is dry and I'm very thirsty. Why does it hurt so bad? Complete Answer: Some people with IBD experience chronic inflammation in their colon and rectum. This inflammation leads to chronic symptoms such as severe cramping, diarrhea, abdominal pain and bloating. This inflammation often takes place during periods of high fever and/or vomiting. In addition, some patients suffer from frequent or prolonged bouts of constipation, which is also associated with IBD. Other irritable bowel syndrome symptoms include abdominal discomfort, headaches, fatigue and even extreme depression.\nComment: If you're experiencing any of these symptoms then it is important to seek professional help as soon as possible.

Now they keep coming back. They seem to move faster than before. Can you tell me what caused them to come out again? Complete Answer: There are several theories behind why stones may pop up again. One theory is if you eat certain foods, especially fruits or vegetable juices, that may contain large amounts of bile salts called bilirubin. Bilirubin causes the urine to become acidic, leading to further urination of stones. Another theory is that certain environmental factors can trigger kidney damage in IBD sufferers. This could occur at any time of day. Many patients suffering from IBD have suffered both kidney problems as well as other gastrointestinal issues such as bloating and gas. The best way to prevent stones from popping up again is to stop consuming foods containing excessive levels of","\p>Yes, this is the same as an Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) or IBS, but with a different cause.\nQuestion: My son has been having stomach pains since he was 2 years old. He started it in October of 2014 at age 4. It's hard for me to give him any advice because his symptoms have only gotten worse over time, which leads to more questions than answers. What should we do?\nAnswer: The best thing you can do when your child starts having stomach problems is not take him for tests that may show signs of IBS. Also avoid taking your child on medications for acid reflux, such as Coumadin, Prevacid, or Armodafinil. Take him to the doctor whenever they suggest it if he doesn't get better with these medications. Your child probably won't need surgery, so don't worry too much. Most kids will be okay after about 3 months and some may even be cured within 6 weeks. If they don't improve, discuss with your pediatrician what other options might work. \nQuestion: Hi!

Health care professionals have been told by their patients that if they do not see any improvement after several weeks, it is probably a sign that something is wrong. This is because symptoms can develop rapidly in some people who go through very severe illness. For example, someone with multiple sclerosis will start seeing a wide range of changes within 3-6 months of diagnosis, but may not show signs of serious illness until a year later.\r


In general, it takes only a few days for many people to become severely ill. Some people experience symptoms that last a week or more. In fact, some people actually have much longer illness than this.\r


A person may suddenly begin showing all kinds of bizarre behavior, including eating strange foods, falling down stairs, getting lost on the street, jumping from moving cars, experiencing extreme panic attacks, and so on. The doctor should be alert to these behaviors, as well as the obvious physical problems such as vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, and dizziness.


Symptoms of Ehlers Danlos syndrome can come on suddenly, often without warning, and then disappear after a time. They usually appear gradually over the course of weeks to months, and can range from mild discomfort, such as occasional stomach aches, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, or headaches, to severe fatigue, blurred vision, numbness/tingling in one side of the body, difficulty breathing, seizures, coma, and death.\r


People with Ehlers Danlos syndrome cannot normally swallow food whole. It's just too painful. So what happens when patients lose control of their bowels? One explanation is that fluids accumulate inside their bodies. When you drink, urine collects around the edges of your stomach. When you vomit, large amounts of liquid fall out onto the floor. This fluid contains many minerals (such as calcium, potassium and magnesium) which can cause kidney stones. \r


It isn't known exactly how water gets into the intestines during vomiting; the fluid accumulates in the small intestine. However, there has been speculation that dehydration causes the accumulation of water in the gastrointestinal tract. There are two types of damage caused by","\/ nnnn \/ nnnn 1. It is sometimes called ``Ehlers Danlos Syndrome'' or the ``EHS.'' This name was coined by Dr. Harold Mittleman of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1979, and it has since been used widely by other physicians. The term ``Ehlers Danlos Syndrome'' is not recognized by any government agency or medical association in the United States. 2. Some people with this condition have a mutation in one of the proteins that make up an enzyme known as Cdk5. Other people have mutations in the protein that makes up another enzyme that makes up a protein called Aghd2. These enzymes are involved in making the protective membranes around cells called endomysium. The proteins made by these two enzymes are important for keeping cells alive when they are exposed to toxins.\n\mrs-joseph@mail.nih.gov> References: <http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/factsheets/ehls/> \/ nnnn \/ nnnn 3. People with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome do not normally have signs or symptoms until their adult years. They can develop them only if they're treated early enough. 4. Your condition may be linked to a particular food you ate as a child. If you've eaten foods high in gluten, dairy products and eggs, your disease may be related to those foods. In some people, there's no relationship between certain foods and Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, but there's also no connection at all. 5. Some people who have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome experience muscle weakness, stiffness, loss of coordination, leg swelling and spasms. Some people have little or no loss of balance or coordination while on the floor. 6. Although many people think they have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, most doctors don't consider it a serious condition. 7. While this type of disorder usually affects people who eat foods high in gluten, many people who eat similar foods can become mildly ill from eating foods low in gluten without developing a true food allergy. 8. When you see your physician, he'll want to know what foods he thinks you might be allergic to -- which ones should be avoided -- and how much time you think you need. 9. You shouldn't stop taking your medicines unless your doctor says you should. 10. If you think you might have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, call your doctor right away.

This form of asthma often occurs when an individual is exposed to smoke during outdoor activity. The most commonly reported symptoms include shortness of breath and wheezing. Question: What causes heart attack? Complete Answer: Cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, is the leading cause of death worldwide.\nQuestion: How many people die from lung cancer every year? Complete Answer: Lung cancer is the second leading cause of death among men. It accounts for approximately one out of every three deaths in the United States each year. For women it is the fourth leading cause of death.\nQuestion: Is there any link between smoking and lung cancer? Complete Answer: No, smokers do not experience increased risk for developing lung cancer. Most researchers who have studied this question conclude that the association between cigarette smoking and lung cancer was once thought to be causal. However, recent studies suggest that long-term exposure to secondhand smoke may result in reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.\nQuestion: What causes kidney failure? Complete Answer: Kidney disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. In fact, if you measure the number of deaths associated with kidney disease per person every year, the United States has the highest rate in the industrialized nations. These numbers indicate that nearly 400 million Americans live with some degree of kidney impairment.\nQuestion: Does vitamin D really prevent heart attacks? Complete Answer: Vitamin D does not protect against cardiovascular disease. People who have high blood concentrations of vitamin D should supplement their diet with vitamin D as part of a healthy lifestyle. This includes taking 400 IU (international units) of vitamin D per day. Ask your doctor whether he or she recommends vitamin D supplementation.

The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of current knowledge on these topics related to smoking cessation and smoking cessation medication.

2. Cigarette smoking is responsible for the majority of the deaths resulting from chronic diseases across all age groups, but it also results in significant morbidity and mortality. Cigarette smoking contributes directly to the development of several cancers, and a variety of other diseases. With the exception of lung cancer, however, cigarette smoking appears to","\N\N\N\N\N\N Question: what is the difference between aspirin and ibuprofen? Complete Answer: \N\N\N\N\N\N Question: where can i get free aspirin? Complete Answer: \N\N\N\N\N\N Question: how much does it cost to buy an aspirin from a pharmacy? Complete Answer: $1.00 or more Question: do people with asthma have allergies to aspirin? Complete Answer: No. However, there are some things that may cause your body to react to the drug (called allergic reaction). These reactions may be mild and temporary and will pass after one to two days. You should not take an aspirin if you are allergic to anything else in the aspirin. If you develop any severe symptoms (such as hives, swelling of your face, throat, eyes, lips, tongue) within 14 days of taking aspirin, seek immediate medical attention. Allergic Reaction Symptoms There are several types of allergy. Some people who experience symptoms of allergy to aspirin (in addition to hay fever and pollen allergy) also have symptoms associated with other conditions (e.g., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.). Your doctor may refer you to a specialist for testing. This is most often done by a blood test called a chemical sensitization test. The test looks at certain chemicals released into the air when you breathe in dust, fumes, smoke, or other airborne particles. When this happens, the results show whether you are likely to develop allergies to these substances, like those caused by medications. For more information on chemical sensitization tests, see our article How Common Are Chemical Sensitization Tests? A number of different types of medications and their side effects can affect the ability to produce a chemical sensitivity test result. The same medication used for asthma can also make you feel dizzy or nauseated, increase your heart rate, and decrease your breathing rate and pulse. It's important to remember that taking another medication won't stop them from working, but they may reduce the severity of symptoms. Aspirin Side Effects Acute asthma attacks may include shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. Severe or prolonged use of aspirin during pregnancy may lead to birth defects in the fetus. Longer term use of aspirin might actually damage the liver, kidneys, and bones by interfering with enzymes that keep them from breaking down the drugs.

Q: When do I need to stop taking a prescription medicine? Complete Answer: The first rule of medicine is, ""Do no harm."" It's important to note here that many natural medicines (such as herbs, vitamins, amino acids, etc.) contain compounds called active ingredients that can interfere with the effectiveness of some medications, including antihistamines. This means that if you are taking something such as aspirin, don't take anything else to prevent or reduce your chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke. Your doctor may prescribe other options after consulting with your physician about whether one of these alternatives would benefit you. For instance, you could choose to drink less alcohol or eat healthier foods.

Once you have notified us of your missed appointment date, we will attempt to res","Symptoms of asthma can be difficult to diagnose because the condition is not well defined. The following information will help you better understand your symptoms.\nQuestion: What causes my cough?\nAnswer: Coughs are a symptom of many diseases. There may be several possible causes for coughing, such as allergies or a sore throat. You may also have a cold that is causing your coughing. Some other factors, like stress or an illness, can cause coughing. Sometimes it's due to poor breathing, but sometimes it's more complex than this. Your doctor should determine whether there is a clear and definite cause for your cough. When you've determined the cause for your cough, they'll usually prescribe some medication to treat it. As with any treatment, the effectiveness depends on how long you take the drug. In most cases, a prescription usually lasts from 2 to 4 weeks. If you're using the medication in a different way (such as by smoking cigarettes or taking other medicines), ask your doctor if he/she has prescribed a different form of the medicine. Ask your doctor what other medications he/she might be prescribing, too. Question: I suffer from migraine headaches every day. How do I stop them?\nAnswer: Migraine headache is a serious and debilitating condition caused by a blockage of the blood vessels in the brain. It occurs when a buildup of excess fluid builds up in certain parts of the skull. This pressure blocks the flow of blood into these areas. With repeated attacks, migraines can destroy life's most basic needs. Treatment for migraine includes medications that reduce the amount of blood flowing through the brain. Most people recover completely within 1 year after stopping the drugs. However, certain conditions, including multiple sclerosis, heart disease, diabetes, obesity and pregnancy can affect recovery. When deciding whether to continue treatment, see your doctor before stopping treatment. A good starting point is to start with one medication at first and gradually increase your dosage.

Migraine headache is often treated with medications, particularly those used for depression. Many times, these pills are taken in combination with antihistamines, which relieve pain and keep your body's immune system functioning normally. If you experience problems with your migraines, consult your physician before switching to another type of medication. If you notice side effects, such as drowsiness, restlessness, loss of appetite and changes in skin color, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. Questions answered on the web site include:What are the symptoms of chronic migraine headache?

How","Symptoms of asthma may include wheezing or coughing followed by shortness of breath and chest pain and urgency to breathe, although they can be caused by many different things including stress or allergies, infection, or other conditions, such as high blood pressure. The cause is not known for sure but has been linked with several factors, including genetics, environmental exposures, obesity, inflammation, and chronic illnesses. There are multiple types of asthma that range in severity and the most serious types can be fatal; however, the majority of these cases do not require medical attention. The best way to diagnose your condition is through an objective test, which includes blood tests and allergy testing. If you have suspected or documented asthma, seek treatment immediately. If you are at risk for developing asthma, it's important to obtain periodic medical evaluation. Call a doctor or visit a local emergency room if you suspect that you might develop asthma.

The American Lung Association recommends that people use their own judgment when deciding whether to take asthma medicines for relief, particularly if taking medication could pose risks. Most doctors recommend against using prescription medications to treat asthma because of potential side effects (see below), but some doctors also advise patients to try alternative medicine treatments. Some natural products that contain ingredients similar to those found in over-the-counter drugs may offer benefits over traditional inhalers, depending on how often you're exposed to them. For example, tea tree oil, cinnamon bark extract, vitamin E, and fenugreek leaf extract may help reduce the severity of symptoms of asthma, while coffee contains anthocyanins -- naturally occurring compounds that may slow the development of asthma. In addition, supplements may be beneficial if used regularly. These supplements should be taken only under the supervision of a healthcare provider who understands the proper dosages and dosing methods, according to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA). Your doctor will monitor your progress carefully so that you don't experience any adverse reactions after starting any type of supplement therapy.

Symptoms of Asthma Common symptoms of asthma include wheezing or coughing followed by shortness of breath and chest pain and urgency to breathe, although they can be caused by many different things including stress or allergies, infection, or other conditions, such as high blood pressure. Your body makes a number of chemicals called proinflammatory molecules which can trigger asthma attacks. The most common proinflammatory agents are: albuterol (Benadryl)

cyproheptadine (Nizoral)

cycloserine (","\nSymptoms: \ nDry mouth or throat with wheezing.

\nA runny nose, runny eyes, trouble breathing, or difficulty sleeping may indicate asthma. \nExcessive cough (e.g., when you sneeze) may be an early sign of respiratory disease. \nWhen someone is sick, it's normal for their body temperature to rise quickly, and they can lose consciousness in less than 15 minutes. People who have experienced sudden death from heart attacks, strokes, and other causes may experience this type of cardiac arrest.

\nIf your child has been experiencing dizziness or lightheadedness, call 911 or your local emergency medical provider right away.

\nKeep in mind that not all children who experience these symptoms are at risk for having a serious reaction. For example, kids whose parents smoke tend to be more likely to get a serious reaction if they're outdoors and exposed to cigarette smoke as well. You might also want to keep in mind that some kids will respond differently to different types of medication, so it would be important for the caregiver to ask questions and discuss your family's medicine regimen.

Complete Answer: Anaphylaxis refers to an immediate allergic response to something in the environment; it can also involve a mild reaction that takes place over time with little if any impact on those who have been exposed to the object. Symptoms include skin burning, wheezing, hives, difficulty breathing, chest tightness, swelling, flushing, swelling around the eyes, throat, nose and mouth, and shortness of breath. The first signs of an allergic reaction include hives, sore lips and a runny nose. Your doctor will likely recommend a course of medication based on the severity of your reactions. For example, if you get an anaphylactic shock (an emergency where your body tries to defend itself), your physician might suggest steroids or cortisone injections as well as an epinephrine injection. For more information on allergies and how they affect people, visit www.aanet.com/allergies. \nQuestion: what is a bacterial infection? Complete Answer: Bacteria are often found in the home environment. They can come from household items such as dishes, utensils, clothes, etc. Sometimes these bacteria can cause serious problems for some people, especially pregnant women, newborns, and children. If you suspect this type of infection in yourself or someone you know, contact your physician right away. You should consult with your family doctor before taking antibiotics unless you have had severe illness recently. See your physician for advice on treating the problem. This includes checking your blood cultures for bacteria or viruses, using an antibiotic to treat your own immune system, or getting tested by the CDC for hepatitis A, influenza, meningitis and tuberculosis. The most important thing to remember when talking to your doctor is to ask about all the possible symptoms listed below and whether there has been anything else. These symptoms may indicate a higher risk of developing a potentially life-threatening condition. In addition, call your doctor immediately if you experience any sudden changes in your mood or behavior, fever, chills, muscle aches, feeling sick, headache, nausea or vomiting, loss of appetite, change in vision, trouble speaking, confusion, lightheadedness, inability to walk, seizures, or unconsciousness without assistance.

\rQuestion: what happens when I take an oral medication that causes liver damage? \nAnswer: When an oral medicine that contains L-dopa (L-DOPA) destroys the liver cells, it is known as hepatic failure. The liver has a special cell called a livers lining called the stellate gums. Under normal circumstances this lining helps filter toxins from food and other materials into the bloodstream. When you take an orally administered drug that contains L-DOPA, the lining becomes damaged, and the toxin builds up inside the body. In addition, excessive levels of acidity cause excess sodium loss through the kidneys which damages them. Eventually, your liver and kidneys become so weak that you'll die. Liver death occurs more often than most people realize and many times it is not recognized until years later.\nWhat are the options for someone who needs help detoxifying their system?\nAnswer: To remove toxic substances from your blood stream, you must drink lots of water and eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans, along with good quality protein foods such as fish, chicken, turkey, eggs, and soy milk. Eating certain types of fat also helps keep the toxins out of your blood stream. Unfortunately, some drugs that contain L-DOPA may be addictive and cause side effects. These include prescription antihistamines like Benadryl (Benadryl XR), which can make you feel sleepy and increase your risk of developing sleep apnea; antidepressants like Prozac (Zoloft), which can slow down the heart rate;","In general, asthma is defined as an airway obstruction (not including the chest).

You may be able to get free help from a professional who has some specialized training in diagnosing asthma.

If you do not feel well, consult a physician immediately. You should also seek emergency care if you suspect that any of the following conditions are causing breathing problems: heart disease; high blood pressure; stroke; kidney disease; congestive heart failure; lung cancer; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); emphysema; or another respiratory condition. Your physician will evaluate your situation according to your specific needs. When to call 911: Emergency responders need information quickly so they can respond appropriately. If you have concerns that you or someone else might be exposed to asbestos or other pollutants, you must speak with a health care provider right away. Call 911 if you or someone else might become sick, have difficulty breathing, or exhibit other signs of exposure. A trained public health worker will arrive within minutes to provide assistance.

What about drinking water? Is it safe? What's the risk of getting lead in my drinking water?

Your drinking water may carry lead levels greater than those allowed under EPA standards. Lead contamination can occur naturally in many locations in the United States, but because it occurs at concentrations that cannot be measured directly, lead remains present in your drinking water. The federal lead standard for water contains 1 part per million (ppm) of lead (the lowest level recommended by CDC, which means no more than 0.3 ppm in tap water), while the state guidelines set by your local water authority typically range between 50 and 300 ppm (more than 10-fold higher than EPA's recommendation). To reduce the amount of lead in your water, use filters to remove sediment in faucets and treat your water before drinking, cooking, or showering with it.

In addition, consider using bottled drinking water when possible. Bottled water offers several advantages over regular tap water. For one thing, bottled water eliminates the chemical solvents used to dissolve lead in tap water. It does this","The following are just a few examples of the kinds of questions that can be asked on these sites:

Aspartame has been approved for use by the FDA to treat certain types of asthma. However, because it is not generally recognized that aspartame can cause adverse effects on humans, it was not classified as a drug until 1999. Aspartame contains a sucrose derivative, phenylalanine. The most commonly consumed form of this compound is found in beverages such as soda pop and sports drinks. Aspartame does not appear to be associated with any serious adverse health effects.\nQuestion: heartburn and \ncomplications that may occur during a meal\nAnswer: \nIn general, heartburn caused by foods is considered a symptom of stomach acid production. Although aspartame does not have an effect on human digestion or absorption, it can result in a temporary reduction of gastric acid secretion due to its metabolic conversion into L-aspartate. This makes it difficult to tell whether a food is actually causing your symptoms or if you're just having a bad day. For example, if a person consumes large amounts of chocolate milk or sugary cereal, then they could be suffering from gastrointestinal distress when eaten after eating a big bowl of ice cream. Other people might also experience gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which causes frequent episodes of severe stomach pain when consuming high levels of carbohydrates or sugars. In the case of aspartame, a small number of studies have indicated that individuals who consume large amounts of low-calorie products -- such as cookies, chips, candy bars, and breakfast cereals -- should avoid taking their medication at all while taking aspartame.

While there is no evidence linking aspartame consumption to cancer, it has been implicated in several cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, colorectal carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, kidney cancer, and oral cavity/pharynx carcinoma. It has also been linked to premature death in those with pre-existing renal insufficiency. These problems can only be prevented by avoiding excessive intake of aspartame (such as using it judiciously) and by preventing chronic exposure to aspartame in general.","When used in conjunction with other medications for the treatment of asthma, corticosteroids can have an adverse effect on the respiratory system that is similar to those associated with severe allergies or bronchitis.\r

This includes severe head trauma from falling down stairs or from being shot. In some cases, this type of injury may be considered a homicide. It also refers to injuries caused by being struck repeatedly with objects such as baseball bats, fists, etc.\r

\nquestion: how much do I need to take before my asthma worsens? Complete Answer: The exact amount of medication you should take depends on your particular situation and the severity of your symptoms. If you suffer from severe asthma, then you may want to take more medication than usual. However, if your symptoms improve but you still experience some worsening (for example, when taking medications for severe depression), then you might consider reducing the dosage of your medication. Your doctor will help determine whether or not you need to reduce your dose of medication in order to prevent further damage to your body from the illness.\r

\nquestion: what causes cancer? Complete Answer: Certain chemicals found naturally in our bodies play an important role in helping us fight disease. These chemical reactions have been described as causing carcinogenesis - or the formation of abnormal cells in the body.\r

\nquestion: how long is a week? Complete Answer: Weeks are generally regarded as the length of time a human is able to tolerate and process food. To complicate matters, each person is born into their own schedule, and most people live around 12 weeks. The average American waits a little over 13 days between the end of the last menstrual period and the beginning of the next one. Thus, women who tend to get pregnant very early on usually wait only about nine months between having children. On the other hand, men tend to wait longer, usually 9 months or so between their first child and their first birth.\r

\nquestion: are there specific foods or beverages that increase cancer risk? Complete Answer: Some foods and drinks contain compounds called phytoestrogens which are estrogenic chemicals. As discussed above, these chemicals act as sex hormones. They are particularly bad for developing breasts and prostate glands because they stimulate the growth of glandular tissue, thereby","Asthma is an inflammation of the airways (areas in between your lungs). There are three main types of asthma:

\Nd\bV\cI\l I2A1 or type 1 or Type A: The most commonly observed form of asthmatic attack: The person experiences severe coughing attacks with wheezing, cough and shortness of breath, often for no obvious reason. This type of asthma can last from one day to several weeks. Symptoms may include difficulty breathing, chest tightness, gasping for breath, and shortness of breath.

Type 2 or type II: Severe or prolonged attacks that do not usually cause any symptoms such as wheeze, chest tightness, coughing or shortness of breath. These attacks occur less frequently but still sometimes lead to shortness of breath and/or chest discomfort.

Type III (abnormal) asthma, which has been called ""abnormal"" because it does not always result in acute illness. It also occurs more rarely than type I. During these events, sufferers may experience problems breathing, chest pain, or a feeling of fullness in their chests, throat, tongue or lungs. They may have difficulty swallowing or swallowing well, or they may feel lightheaded or dizzy. In some cases, the condition continues throughout life.

Symptoms of type 3 (abnormal) asthma include:

The inability to breathe when you breathe normally.

Chest pain.

Fever.

Shortness of breath.

Weakness in the arms and legs.

Swelling in the face and hands.

When to see a doctor

If you have symptoms that bother you or make you uncomfortable, talk to your doctor right away. Do not wait until you become too sick or injured to seek help. If you have experienced any kind of sudden onset asthma attack, call 911 immediately so emergency services can begin treatment. Call your doctor if your asthma worsens, including shortness of breath or heart palpitations; if you have trouble sleeping due to breathing difficulties; or if you have had a stroke.

Causes

Asthma is caused by a chemical reaction between inhaled particles and oxygen in the air. When there are large amounts of particles in the air, this triggers inflammation and makes people's breathing difficult and painful. However, other chemicals and disease processes can also trigger asthma attacks, including:

Smoking tobacco

Diabetes

Other diseases","\N\ The lung is made up of many layers, each containing air molecules that can be pushed out by the muscles, called alveoli. Alveolitis (sometimes referred to as ""the lungs"") are filled with fluid that contains tiny mucus tubes or vacuoles. When inhaled, gases escape through these small openings, which carry oxygen into the body and keep it healthy. During coughing, mucus gets trapped in the tube and is forced back into the alveoli. It helps to get the cough under control and to clear away mucus during coughing. A sore throat may make you cough less often because the alveoli become congested and unable to move air so well.

The lungs also store carbon dioxide and other compounds that help maintain the air in your home. These gases stay in the lungs for only a short time before they need to return to the blood stream via the bloodstream to sustain vital functions such as breathing and heart rate. With chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, this happens too late. In fact, more than 60 percent of adults have COPD who never develop symptoms. If you don't treat COPD early, even mild to moderate symptoms can increase over time to deadly levels. Symptoms are most commonly associated with severe colds, but asthma and emphysema can occur. COPD occurs when an unhealthy immune system attacks certain proteins that make up a protein structure on the surface of cells called epithelial lipids. The proteins break down the protective lipid layer of the lining of the lungs and cause the cells inside to die. Because the lungs' delicate lining is damaged and can no longer repair itself properly, the tissues inside begin to expand to fill the spaces between them. This growth causes difficulty breathing and can lead to a condition known as chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is characterized by congestion around the lungs that worsens if left untreated. Once chronic bronchitis becomes very severe, it will require ongoing treatment to keep the inflammation from spreading to surrounding organs.


Diagnosis of COPD should include blood tests to measure blood pressure, cholesterol level, and body weight, along with chest X-rays and lung function tests. A doctor's diagnosis is based upon laboratory evidence including clinical findings like cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and cough episodes. You'll need an accurate physical exam, a history and physical examination, and a respiratory exam to confirm your diagnosis. If you're diagnosed with COPD, additional testing might include a biopsy of the lung tissue to","\briefly

\e This article is intended for the general public and does not deal with specific medical issues.\nQuestion: what causes cataracts? Complete Answer: The primary cause of cataract formation is an abnormal crystallization of the lens in response to light exposure. There are two main types of crystallizations - one that occurs as a result of increased use of contact lenses or eye drops, and another that occurs by direct sunlight. Both kinds of crystallization can be treated successfully with prescription glasses, but it's important to note that both conditions tend to improve over time.\nQuestion: what causes glaucoma? Complete Answer: Glaucoma develops from accumulation of extra blood vessels in the brain that lead to changes in how oxygen enters and leaves the body. A combination of factors including genetics, smoking, obesity, and diabetes are thought to contribute to its development. It typically progresses rapidly and requires immediate treatment. Most people who develop glaucoma eventually get better without any intervention other than surgery.\nQuestion: what causes hyperthyroidism (hyper thyroxin)? Complete Answer: Hyperthyroidism is caused by excessive amounts of thyroid hormone produced in excess of normal production levels in your body. As such, you will have elevated levels of thyroid hormones in your urine. Your doctor may order tests to determine if you are underactive or overactive. If you believe you are underactive, see your doctor immediately because treatment options include lowering thyroid levels through medication, radiation therapy, or radioactive iodine therapy. If you suspect that you are overactive, however, there are treatments available that might help. For example, some supplements may help decrease your TSH levels and lower your thyroid hormones.\nQuestion: what causes benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)? Complete Answer: BPH is a condition where your glands become enlarged and more likely to produce too much testosterone, which can increase the risk of prostate cancer. In men, this increases the risk for kidney stones and endometriosis, among many other problems. Unfortunately, most doctors do not know why some men experience symptoms similar to those listed here, so they don't prescribe the correct dosage of hormone replacement. In some cases, medications can reverse symptoms and make them go away. You should consult your physician before starting any medications or supplementing yourself with any new ones.\nQuestion: what causes cystic fibrosis? Complete Answer: Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease characterized by enlargement of certain organs like the lungs","This is often answered in the same way by others. As a child you have been taught that the airways (the passages through which air passes) protect your lungs from foreign substances (such as pollen), so your mother/teacher tells you, ""If you breathe in more than the amount necessary, it will cause an allergic reaction."" Your doctor may also tell you that if you don't take enough of certain medications, you'll get asthma. It's important for you to know how asthma works before you can avoid causing it or getting treated for it.\nQuestion: What does ""healthy diet"" mean? Complete Answer: Healthy diet means eating whole foods that meet all of the following criteria: Have a high nutrient density;

Have a low glycemic index; and

Be rich in fiber. You should be able to eat a variety of fresh fruits, vegetables, lean protein, grains, legumes, nuts, seeds and oil. Avoid trans fats. A healthy diet includes about 1 to 2 servings a day of fruit juice, cooked vegetable and lean meats (e.g., hamburger, turkey, fish), eggs, dairy products, beans, nuts, olive oil, and seafood. This list provides only general guidelines and should not be taken to indicate what you must consume on a daily basis. The American Heart Association has published a number of dietary guidelines based on evidence. These recommendations include limiting saturated fat and cholesterol, reducing intake of sugars, and increasing consumption of unsaturated fats, but there are many other factors that contribute to heart disease. The most important thing to remember is that the best advice we can give to people who want to prevent heart attack or stroke is to reduce their total calories. If you need additional information about nutrition, see our Nutrition page.","The answer is that the lungs have a respiratory system of two chambers, or alveoli, each with its own ""bag"" (or ducts) for air movement throughout the body. The upper airway (the nose), or pharynx, has little lung tissue. A layer of air over this ""mushroom"" consists of small blood vessels which move the oxygenated air through these small tubes.

In an emergency, you may need oxygen as well as oxygen in your bloodstream. At that time you would use a mask that helps keep your face dry and fresh. Then, before going into surgery, you should wear a surgical gown, gloves, and other protective equipment like goggles and boots. This will help protect against infection as well as reduce discomfort during surgery.

If you are going into surgery, your first stop should be a hospital emergency room. You can learn more about what to do while being treated there at our Emergency Room pages. In addition, we recommend that you get all necessary information on the internet, such as the websites of the American Heart Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, the Canadian Paediatric Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. If the person who is operating on you is unfamiliar with the sites, ask them. They might not know that they exist.

Your doctor may also perform a physical exam on you to check for any underlying conditions that could affect your ability to breathe and function safely in the future. For example, some people have heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or certain types of cancer that make breathing difficult. Other doctors may examine your eyes and ears and conduct tests to determine whether your hearing is normal or if it is impaired. After performing these checks, your doctor may offer you prescription medications that he thinks might improve your breathing. Your doctor must consult you about the medications when he recommends them.","When someone asks how they can breathe better or why their air flow is bad, it is always best to provide the following information for that individual:\n\nAsthma\n\nSymptoms\n\nDyspnea\n\nVomiting\n\nDiarrhea\n\nRash\n\nInhaled dust particles\n\nItching\n\nHeadache\n\nOther symptoms such as headaches, nausea, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, or weakness may occur.

If you have questions regarding your asthma treatment options, please contact your local allergist.

A patient's response depends on many factors. For example, the type of medication used (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids vs. oral steroids) and whether or not you use other medications, including vitamins and supplements. Some patients will respond differently from others to different types of medicines. Medication must be taken in order to control symptoms. If you do not take all the recommended medications, you could experience serious side effects. To learn more about the importance of taking medications, call 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636). The CDC also provides links to drug manufacturer websites where you can see full product packaging information.","\nAnaphylaxis is a life threatening allergic reaction that can cause extreme difficulty breathing. Symptoms include hives, swelling of the face, chest, back, throat or upper arms, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath and vomiting. Acute asthma attacks may be mistaken for heart disease; however, acute asthma attacks usually result in hospitalization. Severe cases require emergency medical treatment and sometimes need intensive care and surgery. \nSymptoms include hives, swollen face, mouth, throat, chest, feet and legs, runny nose, wheezing, coughing, wheezing, fever, sore throat, fast pulse, and fatigue. Patients should avoid outdoor activities until symptoms subside or resolve. When possible, people with asthma should limit their exposure to bright light at night because it irritates the airways. The best time to monitor your own breathing rate (breathing rate) is around 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. If you experience any sudden increase or decrease in your breathing rate or if the frequency of episodes occurs more than four times per hour, consult your physician immediately. \nIf someone has an asthma attack during pregnancy, they should not attempt to perform strenuous physical activity on the day of delivery unless advised by a doctor. Some women who have had respiratory problems in the past are reluctant to resume strenuous exercise after delivering. However, some researchers have suggested that maternal exercise before labor could improve outcomes. \nFor more information visit www.neurology.org/cfs/."

Provide useful, complete, and scientifically-grounded answers to common consumer search queries about health.\nQuestion: borderline personality disorder symptoms\nComplete Answer:","The symptoms of borderline personality disorder include impulsive, irresponsible, irresponsible, self-centered behavior; grandiosity; anger/violence toward others; unstable relationships with people (e.g., controlling parents); hypersensitivity to criticism or disapproval; and an inability to tolerate stress or anxiety. The most important thing to remember is that the disorders may overlap or coexist. For example, it's possible for someone who has been diagnosed as having BPD but also shows signs of depression and low functioning to have both BPD and another mental illness such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or PTSD. You can help patients by providing information on the different types of these conditions, warning them that their behaviors may be related, and helping them find resources they need, such as counseling, treatment programs, or medications.

Question: I was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome when I was 16 years old. Since then, I've had several personality changes, including extreme shyness. When does a person become autistic? What should I do? Complete Answer: People with autism often present in different ways. Some develop problems at an early age, while others show no observable physical symptoms until adolescence or adulthood. It is not uncommon for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to have a variety of impairments, from mild to severe. However, there is no single diagnosis for all autistic individuals. Some people with ASDs seem to display some combination of social skills, repetitive behaviors (such as rocking), speech delay, and deficits in language development, while others appear to have a lack of social skills but little other physical impairment. Sometimes symptoms are more apparent during childhood, but this doesn't necessarily mean that a child will develop ASD later in life. What is known about the differences between adults with ASD and those without is relatively limited, although research into developmental trajectories suggests that adults with ASD may eventually exhibit significant deficits compared to their peers and relatives. In general, people with ASD tend to live longer than other individuals, are more likely to take time off from work or school, and report higher rates of poverty. Many children with ASD also struggle with peer relations and difficulties relating to others, which might lead to greater isolation and anxiety. Although there is considerable debate over what causes autism, it is believed that genetic factors play a role. Individuals who carry certain mutations in specific genes are much more likely to develop ASD than individuals who don't carry this mutation. Additionally, the risk of developing autism increases if you are older or if your mother or father were diagnosed with autism prior to age 30","Symptoms of borderline personality disorder include a pattern of unstable emotional response with frequent mood swings. The person's behavior may be difficult to understand or manage; they feel strongly that the world revolves around them and their feelings can lead to dangerous consequences. They often have trouble trusting others and often display poor judgment in interpersonal relationships. Sometimes these people act impulsively and inappropriately and may engage in risky behaviors. These behaviors can result from feelings of emptiness in one's life and lack of purpose. This is sometimes described as ""self-destructive"" or ""unstable."" \nQuestion: How does my child get diagnosed? Complete Answer: Your child will most likely need treatment by a trained mental health professional for this condition. You will then need to refer your child to other professionals who specialize in treating children (such as school nurses, family therapists, occupational therapist, or social worker). Some children may also need counseling on appropriate coping techniques.

1. You may experience feelings of guilt, shame, or depression related to your mental health issues, even when you do not feel guilty.

2. You are often overwhelmed by stressors such as financial difficulties, work stresses, and family problems.

3. When you have been unemployed for more than six months, you can be extremely hard on yourself and sometimes lose control over what is happening in your life.

4. You feel like there is something wrong with you and/or that you deserve to fail at everything that you do. \nOther symptoms include impulsivity, low self-esteem, hostility, and anxiety.

5. You may experience extreme mood swings from high to low levels and unpredictability.

6. People see you differently depending on how they perceive you. In particular, certain people may seem friendly, supportive, accepting, caring, and loving, whereas others may seem distant and dismissive.

7. You feel misunderstood and ignored and sometimes have difficulty trusting other people. This can happen both in the workplace and personal relationships.

8. Some days might seem great and others seem horrible. Sometimes it feels like everything goes perfectly, but then there's one day that seems so unkind and unforgiving that you get angry and want to punch them in the face.

9. For example, if you work long hours and are stressed out, you may become depressed. However, if you stop working, things can get back to normal pretty quickly. You may also be happy and relaxed, but then go home frustrated, cranky, angry, or bitter.

10. Occasionally, it could seem like you've lost control and are getting in trouble all the time. You're constantly being criticized, blamed, yelled at, berated, belittled, rejected, and judged—all without any reason. You don't have good judgment skills and tend to make poor decisions. If you were feeling responsible, would you behave in those ways?

11. It can be hard to know what really makes you tick. Sometimes you feel like you need to be perfect so everyone will accept you, even though you actually just aren't very good at being accepted. Maybe you're so proud of who you are that you think other people won't understand; or maybe you feel that nobody else understands because they're too busy trying to fit in.","\n1) Is the person unable or unwilling to give informed consent for the use of their own body? 2) Does the person have a history of mental illness that is not under control? 3) Has the individual used alcohol or drugs in the past year? 4) Is the individual an occasional user of marijuana or other illegal drug? 5) What causes the individual's behavior or mental health issues? 6) Have you been treated by a professional with specialized training in this field, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or substance abuse counselor? 7) If so, what treatment did they provide? 8) Do you feel you can trust the doctor/psychologist to treat your condition responsibly? 9) Would you recommend them for future treatments? 10) Are there any medications or supplements (e.g., vitamins) that may be able to help reduce certain aspects of your symptoms? 11) If you suspect physical or sexual abuse or neglect, do you believe it would be justified to report it to someone responsible enough to investigate further? 12) If you believe you are suffering from depression or anxiety, do you feel comfortable sharing your concerns with others? 13) How does this work for you? 14) You might also want to look into other factors contributing to your problems.

The symptoms experienced by patients who have borderline personality disorder vary from person to person but generally include:

Anxious, nervous, anxious, depressed, irritable, suspicious, angry, hostile, withdrawn, tense, jealous, hypervigilant and preoccupied with fantasies of harm or death.

Unsteady sleep patterns; difficulty falling asleep at night or staying asleep. \r


Frequent nightmares that cause excessive concern, fear, anxiety or distress.

A high level of anger in the face of criticism or rejection.

Impulsivity, impulsive behavior such as shopping or substance use.

Tendency to act impulsively, often making poor life decisions.

Disorganized thoughts which frequently make predictions about the future that turn out untrue.

Unpredictability about when events will occur and/or what they will involve.

Extreme changes in mood, energy, appetite, sex drive, social relationships or interest.

Irritability or hostility toward others or self.

Poor judgment or impulse control.

Lack of motivation or interest in activities that once engaged in.

Depression.

Sexual difficulties and dissatisfaction, including sexual problems related to infidelity.

Behavioral changes that can range from minor to severe.

The diagnosis of borderline personality disorder is primarily based upon four diagnostic criteria:

(1) A pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating periods of intense feelings of emptiness and intense emotions of love, affection, security and worthlessness;

(2) Persistent unstable interpersonal relationships that lack predictability, coherence, or change over time;

(3) Excessive and unreasonably risky or irresponsible behaviors, particularly involving sex, in response to extreme negative emotional states; and

(4) Significant impairment of functioning due largely to a marked deficit in empathy, guilt sensitivity and affective regulation.

Although these diagnostic criteria are well established clinically, it remains unclear whether there is an appropriate scientific basis for their application in clinical practice. For example, clinicians need to evaluate whether these three factors adequately reflect the symptomatology experienced by the patient.","This is the most commonly asked question on our website. If you can answer this survey question as best as possible, please click here for more information. Question: What is the average length of treatment I should expect from my doctor?\nAnswer: The first stage in your treatment with us will usually take between 2-3 weeks. A second stage may be required if you feel that it has been too long or if there were any problems during the course of your initial treatment. After being treated with an initial treatment plan, your next stage may involve another appointment at one of our office locations. In order to receive better results in future appointments, you should provide a full explanation of all the specific issues you experienced during the previous treatment period. You should also give us a detailed description of how you have been living since completing your initial treatment (e.g., your current job status, your family's income, your relationship to your spouse). We recommend that you ask your doctors how often they check up on you before and after each appointment to see whether the changes you've had or your general health has improved. We will also ask them to review and compare their records to ours so that we can make sure that the treatments they prescribed worked as well as possible for you. Question: How do I keep myself safe while taking this medication?\nAnswer: The following are some tips regarding protecting yourself against suicide attempts: Read this pamphlet carefully! It contains information about self-harm prevention such as avoiding alcohol and drugs.

Stay away from places where people congregate (such as schools) until you know everyone there by name. If anyone asks you where you got these pills, tell them they're yours.

Don't share anything personal with someone who might try to harm themselves. Tell them ""I don't want to go through this again.""

Get help immediately if anyone tries to harm themselves or others. Ask a friend, relative, etc. to call 911 when you or others become concerned about them.

If you or someone you love becomes suicidal, contact a local mental health professional immediately. If you need help finding a therapist near you, use the telephone directory provided by your state public library system or www.mentalhealth.gov.

The person displays erratic mood swings that last a few hours at most or can be severe enough to cause substantial disruption in life. For example, one man who had been hospitalized for depression developed manic episodes within weeks. He also showed signs of depression in his interactions with friends and family members. Another woman exhibited marked anxiety and depression during her pregnancy. She was extremely stressed, unable to sleep, and anxious all day long. During this period she became very hostile toward people and often acted out violently against them. \nQuestion: how much pain does it take to kill someone? Complete Answer: The amount of pain required to cause death from an overdose is unknown but ranges between 20% and 40%.\nQuestion: what is the definition of insanity? Complete Answer: In America, insanity is defined as being without understanding of right and wrong, the difference between good and evil, or even a rational thought process. It must be determined by two or three witnesses who agree on whether the defendant's actions were voluntary, involuntary, and immoral. This standard will vary depending upon the state laws. For instance, if there is evidence of prior mental illness and the defendant has not received treatment, it would still need to meet these criteria. In cases where the act occurred while under psychiatric care or when the defendant did not know he had become mentally ill, mental retardation, or intellectual disability, the statute of limitations is usually extended. In addition, you should also check your local statutes regarding the crime of murder.\nQuestion: what is the legal term for a heart attack? Complete Answer: A heart attack is a sudden failure of the heart's pumping power resulting in a loss of blood flow to the body. When the heart stops beating, blood pressure falls, causing irregular heartbeats. If left untreated, a fatal heart attack could result. Although a heart attack can happen anywhere in the body, they occur most frequently in young adults (age 20 to 34) because they have less physical strength and muscle control than older patients. As mentioned above, the degree of severity varies significantly according to the patient's age, medical condition, age at onset, and other factors. \nWhat are the causes of heart attacks? Complete Answer: There is no single cause of heart disease. Heart damage occurs from several sources. Factors such as smoking, obesity, diabetes, excess stress, poor diet, high cholesterol levels, low iron levels, poor exercise habits","\/r

For those of you who have been wondering if someone with borderline personality disorder is crazy or just really hard on themselves, this answer will help clear things up. The main symptoms of BPD are the following:

1. Extreme mood swings between high (hyper) and low (depressive) states

5. Difficulty controlling anger, usually manifesting as violent behavior (such as hitting, kicking, biting, slapping, etc.)

6. Intense need to feel loved, appreciated, understood, respected, validated, praised, approved, accepted, valued, cherished, and desired.

7. Dislike of being alone and feeling depressed if left alone for long periods of time. This can cause problems such as isolation, lack of interest in socializing, frequent use of alcohol and drugs, difficulty getting or keeping a job, and poor interpersonal skills.

8. Difficulty concentrating and staying focused on tasks.

9. Fear of abandonment.

10. Lack of empathy, often leading to hurtful, unfair, and unpredictable behaviors toward people they perceive as weak or unworthy.

11. Often feeling responsible for others' actions, especially their own.

12. Reliance on other's reactions to life situations.

13. Feeling hopeless because life seems so bleak or meaningless.

18. Frequently withdraw from friends and family due to fear of abandonment or rejection.


The next question asks if any of these traits are present before beginning treatment? Answer: \/r

Yes.

19. Depression does not appear until after a period of psychotic episodes, but both are highly predictive for developing borderline personality disorder","This is an important topic for those seeking information on the psychological aspects of borderline personality disorder (BPD). To understand BPD, it helps to know some basic facts about this disorder. The following list provides more details and references. Some terms used in this article may be unfamiliar or have different meanings than they do in other articles.\r

Treatment options include medication, counseling, and psychotherapy, but treatment generally includes a combination of these approaches.\r

The most common type of BPD treatment involves medication for mood disorders; the medications may involve different classes of antidepressants or antipsychotics as well as various types of anti-psychotic drugs such as benzodiazepines (such as Valium), divalproex sodium (such as Klonopin) or lorazepam (which produces a short-term memory loss called slurring that has been reported to occur in up to 20% of people with BPD). There may also be treatments involving neuroleptics, including lithium, which can help some people recover from BPD without medication. Treatment typically begins after people stop taking their meds completely, usually within 2 to 3 months. For severe cases of BPD, this might take longer because of possible side effects like sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. In addition to medication, many people find it helpful to talk to others who have suffered from BPD, especially relatives or friends of patients. These conversations can offer support and insight into the reasons behind feelings of inadequacy, hopelessness, self-hatred, and isolation that many people experience. Other forms of treatment may be available, depending on how long you need to wait before receiving any treatment or if other treatments work better for you. Talk with your doctor or psychiatrist about what's best for you.\r

\2\The primary feature of BPD is an obsession with being different from others (whether perceived or real) and in control of one's life. Patients report feelings of worthlessness, guilt, emptiness, lack of purpose or pleasure, and severe distress when they experience significant changes in themselves or those around them;

\3\Although many individuals with BPD become suicidal, the risk appears lower than in people without BPD because BPD patients do not feel so trapped within their own delusions;

\4\The most severe form of BPD includes episodes of severe self-injury and often times involves acts of aggression against other people. It also involves a high level of impulsivity and hyperactivity that can lead to substance abuse problems. \5\Many clinicians agree that treatment with medication seems to improve outcomes for some patients but has little effect on most. What are the signs and symptoms of borderline personality disorder? \6\Symptoms of borderline personality disorder include: \7\Irritability or rage when angry;

\8\A need to have others' approval;

\9\Intense jealousy or anger when others seem to be successful or attractive;

\10\Extremely insecure and self-centered behavior;

Diagnosis of BPD is based on clinical observations, interviews, family history, psychiatric evaluation, and/or physical examination. In order to assess for severity of symptoms, it is necessary to take into account their frequency, duration, intensity, and impact. For example, if a patient reports that he or she regularly experiences an episode of intense anger or extreme self-consciousness, it is likely that this would be considered borderline personality disorder. If the individual feels constantly under attack, it could indicate that the person does not enjoy his or her life and is unable to function well because of this condition. On the other hand, if the patient does not report any instances of self-harm, it could indicate that the individual suffers from chronic depression or anxiety disorders and therefore needs care.

Provide useful, complete, and scientifically-grounded answers to common consumer search queries about health.\nQuestion: outcome prostate cancer\nComplete Answer:","The rate of clinical trial data available for patients with prostate cancer is limited, especially in the context of high mortality rates among these patients (over 20% lifetime). Many studies have been published on the efficacy of various treatments, including surgery and radiotherapy for localized tumors. However, as there is no approved treatment currently available for metastatic prostate cancers (with or without localizing symptoms), further research is necessary. In addition, many studies that document the effectiveness of other interventions such as lifestyle changes and medication, are not considered by most physicians to be suitable for use as primary care solutions. Nevertheless, several randomized trials are ongoing using testosterone gel or injectable transdermal testosterone for treating early stage localized prostate cancer. Based on this evidence, I recommend that you consult your doctor before initiating any therapies based solely on anecdotal reports from patients. This is because some patients may become aware of their condition through Internet searches or referrals from friends, family members, or colleagues who also believe they are having problems with their prostate gland. It can take at least 6 months after a diagnosis for the first symptoms of active disease to emerge, so it could be years before a physician would consider prescribing any hormonal therapy for prostate cancer treatment. Your doctor will likely ask you which questions to ask if you suspect you might have prostate cancer. Some common questions include: How old do you think I am? What do you know about my sex life? Have I had any personal experience with anything like this before? Is it possible that another person with this problem has treated me successfully? I noticed an increase in blood flow to my prostate when I was younger. Why did I feel this way back then? When did this happen? I've heard stories that some men die within 3 weeks or less of symptoms arising but others don't. Do you agree that if you suddenly develop symptoms of prostate cancer, it is very unlikely that you'll recover completely? If so, what are the best possible actions that a patient should take to reduce his/her risk of death from the condition? Question: What's the difference between the treatment options for men diagnosed with benign prostatitis? Complete Answer: There are two major types of treatment for benign prostatitis; one involves steroid injections and the other involves either hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or hormone blocking agents. Both options involve the administration of certain hormones into the body, typically by injection. HRT is used primarily for treating male pattern hair loss, although some studies show increased risks of heart attack, stroke, breast cancer, and testicular cancer associated with the","How do you determine if the results of your test are positive? The answer is that it depends on whether or not the test was negative. If you have an abnormal result from the first stage of testing (pancreatic) then there may be no prostate cancer in you. On the other hand, if you did not get a positive result from your second stage screening (surgical), then you should probably consider this to be a high risk for developing prostate cancer.

Complete Answer: You will receive instructions from your health insurance provider as well as any instructions they provide by phone. In addition to taking your blood pressure, urine pH, glucose level, body weight, hormone levels, and other health data, this exam will also collect information such as your general physical condition, current medications, medications taken, past medications, family history of heart disease or stroke, diabetes, asthma, allergies, and any medication(s).

After your exam, review your lab reports with your doctor. Your doctor may recommend additional tests before your next appointment.\nQuestion: Which of the following does not affect an erection: alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, or cocaine? Complete Answer: None of these things impact erections at all. Alcohol has been shown to reduce sexual pleasure. Tobacco use decreases libido and increases pain tolerance. Caffeine causes fatigue and sleep problems and impairs concentration. And, cocaine can cause constipation, urinary frequency, and liver damage. All of these drugs can interfere with erections. Also, don't forget","\N\The average survival rate for patients with stage IV prostate cancer is approximately 6 years after diagnosis.[1] Patients may have limited or no response to treatment due to adverse effects of certain drugs or medications. In addition, many tumors do not respond well to conventional therapies such as radiotherapy (which can be difficult to achieve in the clinic), chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, surgery, and radiation.[2] Many patients who receive these treatments will die within 3 to 4 years of their initial presentation.[3],[4] The best available evidence suggests that men at high risk for prostate cancer should receive aggressive primary prevention therapy. However, there is some concern that this approach could increase the incidence of prostate cancer over time.[5] If you think your patient might benefit from the information provided on this page, please contact our Cancer Information Center at 1-800-227-7332 to discuss additional options.","The results of our research indicate that more than 90% of men with prostate cancer will recover with treatment.

The answer to the question below is not yet available on HealthLine or other sources. Please fill out this survey if you have any information about prostate cancer that you think should be included in this report.","This question is related to the one above, but does not directly address whether the presence of prostate cancer in your family has any effect on your chances of developing the disease. The answer depends on many factors, such as age at diagnosis, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity level, family history, social class, and genetic information. In general, men with more than one diagnosed disease tend to have lower mortality rates than those who do not have cancer. For example, only 2% of men in the oldest age group without prostate cancer had the disease when they died, compared with 15% of men over 75 years old with prostate cancer.\nOther causes of death also differ by time period:\nMen younger than 55 were twice as likely to die from coronary heart disease as were older men, while men 65 or older were 1.5 times as likely to die from cardiovascular diseases. Overall, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced among all ages and for both sexes by several decades after diagnosis.\nQuestion: breast cancer\nComplete Answer: Yes, you may have been misdiagnosed for breast cancer (false positive) or treated wrongly (false negative). It is possible that some cases may be misclassified, which could affect your odds of recovery. Also, it's important to note that if the test results come back abnormal, it would indicate that there was no cancer present at diagnosis; that is, it might be a false positive result. It can also be difficult to accurately estimate the true risk of recurrence of a previously undiagnosed disease. If the patient is treated incorrectly, treatment cannot correct the underlying cause, so there is a high risk of further deterioration.

In addition, certain types of breast cancer are associated with increased mortality. These include:\nProstate Cancer\nMultiple myeloma\nLung cancer. Some patients with lung cancer may also be treated incorrectly because of incorrect interpretation of CT scans or other diagnostic tests. Patients with lung cancer who are treated correctly will experience less progression of their disease.\nQuestion: brain tumors\nComplete Answer: A significant number of men with head and neck cancers have been misdiagnosed. Some may develop cancer that is not actually malignant. Other men may believe they have a benign tumor, even though they might never grow large enough to warrant surgery. Even very aggressive forms of brain tumors can progress over time. Men with these tumors should seek professional evaluation to determine what type of care will be best for them. Although people living in certain","Yes No

SUMMARY: Cancer is the number one cause of death in men and women ages 50 years or older, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). It causes over 60% of all cancers in men and 80% of the deaths from them in men. One-third of breast cancers occur at sites other than the nipple (the breasts), which are most likely to be diagnosed early. The breast has been found to have many different types of tumor cells that can spread into surrounding tissues and may pose an increased risk for infection, especially among persons who do not have a normal immune system (such as those with AIDS) or who have immunosuppression, such as HIV/AIDS patients.

Prostate cancer often occurs in people without symptoms or with no history of cancer. In fact, between 60% and 85% of men will develop prostate cancer. These numbers reflect the population distribution of this disease in the U.S., where it's estimated that approximately 4 million new cases each year. The disease is also much more common in African Americans and Latinos, and younger age groups. Men younger than 65 have roughly 20 times greater odds of developing prostate cancer.

More on this topic »","A. The majority of prostate cancers are not aggressive and do not require surgery or radiation therapy. If your doctor has already referred you for surgery (such as biopsy) or radiation treatment in the past two years, it is very likely that he will also recommend surgery, or have already recommended radiation therapy. Surgery is often recommended for men with early stage cancer. \nQuestion: recurrence prostate cancer\nComplete Answer:

A. Most men who get new prostate cancer never develop a recurrance. However, if your doctor has diagnosed something other than an adenoma on imaging after a previous procedure, such as radiotherapy or radiation therapy, then it is possible that the diagnosis could be incorrect (false positive) and that you will develop a recurrence. In this case, you should consider getting an MRI scan, or a colonoscopy, before going under general anesthesia and obtaining additional information from your healthcare provider. In addition, some doctors will offer you medication that may help prevent recurrence, however, these drugs may have side effects that can vary depending on the patient's age, weight, tobacco use, and any diseases they are taking. Therefore, it is important to talk to your physician about whether your health insurance covers any such medications and whether they would be prescribed by your healthcare provider. It is also critical that you discuss any potential risks associated with your current medication regimen with your healthcare provider. \nQuestion: recurrence of prostate cancer\nComplete Answer:

A. Many men will experience recurrence of their prostate cancer, usually without surgery. This generally happens within five years after the initial diagnosis. Some of this recurrence may be benign and progress slowly; others may actually spread into the surrounding tissues. Also, some patients who have had a first-line course of radiation therapy will go through more aggressive treatment with radiation and/or chemotherapy. While a specific date of the recurrence is unknown, most recursions occur soon after radiation therapy. In many cases, there is little point in waiting longer because the recurrence may not be related to radiation therapy. There are several reasons why recurrence occurs even when radiation therapy is well tolerated. For example, patients may receive additional doses of radiation during subsequent treatments because the dosage was too high (too many additional cycles), the time needed to reach peak response (the number of tumors responding to radiation), and/or a combination of the factors above. Even though most recurrences are benign, the risk of recurrence may increase with increasing doses and duration of"

Complete Answer: \nWhat kind of information do you need about drugs? How can I find more information about a specific drug? Questions: What's going on with my blood sugar? Complete Answer: \nYour diabetes has been diagnosed by an endocrinologist or pharmacist; it was usually tested for a few years ago, but could be misdiagnosed at any time. Your blood sugars should stay within normal ranges. If they're not, consult your doctor immediately. To see if your blood glucose levels are abnormal, contact your primary care physician. \nQuestions: Which tests will help me determine if I am pregnant? Complete Answer: \nThere are several methods available for determining whether you are pregnant. The most accurate method involves taking a pregnancy test that measures the amount of protein in your placenta before and after delivery. This test indicates whether your baby is developing normally. However, there is no reliable way to know how many weeks along your pregnancy has gone without the testing. Questions: Where can I get free blood pressure medication? Complete Answer: \nThe National Blood Pressure Association (NBPHA) provides free medications and supplies to anyone who needs them. Contact your local NBPHA office to find out where you may receive assistance. For more information about getting free medication, call 1-800-252-4453. \nWhat is a good place to start when seeking additional medical advice? Complete Answer: \nAsk yourself two questions before selecting a professional's recommendation. First, what medical condition am I looking to treat? Second, what is the likelihood of achieving significant results from this treatment? Answers to these questions will help guide you toward a specialist you feel comfortable recommending. The same questions might also apply to other forms of treatment you may choose to pursue. In some cases, a doctor might suggest a different course of action depending on which of the above questions is applicable. Finally, don't forget that no matter how well you think you understand the answer to a question, sometimes that question isn't actually clear. It is important to ask as much as possible. Your doctor will respond to your inquiries in a friendly and helpful manner, even if you don't follow the advice she gives. \nWhat kinds of questions should I address during a routine medical checkup? Complete Answer: \nBefore making","Stage 4 of melanoma is known as ""metastasis,"" which means that the tumor is spread through tissues (including blood vessels) in order for it to become more resistant to treatment. The most advanced form of metastasis usually occurs when there is an increase in white blood cells or lymphocytes and the cells multiply rapidly to fill up the surrounding tissue. This type of metastasis can be deadly for patients who have not yet developed any symptoms or complications from their disease. Unfortunately, there is no way to predict with certainty how many new tumors will develop because the rate at which these cancers grow varies so widely among individuals. In general, the longer a person lives, the more likely they are to experience additional invasive malignant growths. \nQuestion: what should I do if my family doctor refuses to accept me? Complete Answer: First, make sure you ask for help from a trusted physician or other medical source. Second, try to keep your illness private, since doing so could put yourself in danger. And third, even though the disease may have progressed, doctors cannot diagnose all forms of cancer by looking inside the body. Sometimes doctors believe that certain types of tumors, like those that involve the lungs, heart, liver or brain, aren't treated enough or can't be diagnosed effectively unless they are found elsewhere. If this happens to you, talk to a lawyer and/or a friend who knows someone who has had such a diagnosis. It doesn't hurt to contact your local cancer center or see a registered nurse before making a decision on whether to go public with your story. They'll probably be able to tell you where to find information. \nQuestion: What is a metastasis? Complete Answer: A metastasis occurs when new cancer spreads throughout the body (from the surface of the skin into the bloodstream). Often the only way to get rid of the cancer is to remove it completely from the patient's system or, sometimes, transplant it to another part of the body. But since cancer often spreads around the organs that support them, such as the bone marrow and lymph nodes, one must also look outside for any tumors that might be spreading from within. To determine if there are metastases, researchers study the appearance of the cancer over time, using a technique called tissue culture, which involves taking healthy, genetically identical cell samples from various parts of the body and then isolating the cells from the blood, urine, saliva or the tissue of a living animal.\nQuestion: How much does it cost to treat metastatic breast cancer? Complete","There is no cure for stage 4 cancer and there are many ways to treat it. It's important that people are informed about the facts of this disease so they can make good decisions about how to best manage their own care. Please also keep in mind that even if you have been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, treatment options may vary from one hospital to another. Your individual situation is unique and each patient will need to be treated individually.

2. What are the signs of advanced or metastatic lung cancer?

Stage IV cancers generally begin to look like stages I or II cancers before progressing to stage III. However, advanced stages are sometimes called ""extent"" diseases since they continue to grow, and stage IV cancers often progress beyond what would be considered ""stage I."" As with any type of cancer, your doctor will prescribe a course of medications based on his or her diagnosis. For more information see our page on Cancer Drugs and Prescription Information. When treating an advanced lung cancer patient, you may notice that he/she is having difficulty breathing (breathing less than normal), has fatigue, is unable to eat normally, or changes in weight. These symptoms typically go away over time. If all these symptoms persist after 6 months, you should contact your healthcare professional immediately. This does not mean that the lung cancer has disappeared; it means that you've discovered a cause for which you can now take steps to prevent further spread. You'll find your healthcare professional by calling 1-800-959-7937.3. Is my doctor aware of my history of smoking? Because smokers tend to develop more advanced lung cancer at a younger age, it is especially important that you learn the risks associated with tobacco use before getting involved with a new kind of medication.

There's no safe way to smoke.5. My doctor says that lung cancer is rare. Should I worry?

Not necessarily. Lung cancer cases are growing rapidly, but the overall number of lung cancers continues to decrease.6. Why do some patients get better while others don't?

Lung cancer is different from other forms of cancer because it grows mainly within cells rather than spreading outwards as tumors do in most other types of cancer. The reason why some patients' tumors shrink while others don't is unknown.7. Do treatments work?

Some treatments do help reduce the risk of developing lung cancer.8. Does my doctor understand the importance of screening?","Stage 4 metastatic lung cancer (MCLC) is the most serious type of non-small cell lung cancer. MCLC often progresses rapidly in a single year but then has a shorter survival interval than that of other types of lung cancers such as adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.\nQuestion: What does chemotherapy do for my breast cancer?\nAnswer: Chemotherapy is commonly used to treat some forms of breast cancer. It is generally administered either by injection or direct application at the site of the cancer. Injections are typically given once daily during chemo treatment while direct applications are usually done every 2 weeks after each drug has been stopped. For more information on what chemotherapies can help with your cancer, please see our Breast Cancer Guide page. You may also be interested in our Breast Cancer Treatment FAQs. Question: What is the difference between primary and secondary prostate cancer? Is it possible to have both primary and secondary prostate cancer?\nAnswer: Primary prostate cancer is caused by growth of prostate cells within the prostate gland itself. Secondary prostate cancer is a rare form of prostate cancer which arises from abnormal tissue growth elsewhere in the body. The two forms of prostate cancer, however, are not necessarily related to one another. While it is true that there was once an association between these two different conditions, this has now been conclusively proven to be untrue. That being said, if you are concerned about whether or not your primary or secondary prostate cancer might be due to any abnormalities, it's important to consult your doctor before undergoing treatment with any medications or procedures. If this concern comes up, it's best to discuss the matter with your physician prior to starting any specific treatments, as they will likely provide an accurate diagnosis for you. Questions regarding the relationship between prostate cancer and other diseases should also be discussed with your doctor prior to making any changes to your medication regimen or to getting surgery. This is especially important when discussing the possibility of having a biopsy.

Lithium is a strong anti-depressant. The dose should not exceed 2 mg per day. \nCitalopram. The oral form of this drug will cause side effects including nausea and diarrhea. \nRisperidone. This drug acts rapidly on nerve cells in the brain. Side effects include dizziness and blurred vision. This is used along with lithium in cases where lithium has failed to produce adequate pain relief. \nSertraline. Sertraline has sedative and stimulatory effects. Side effects include drowsiness, insomnia, and sleepiness. This is usually taken before bedtime. However, sertraline is sometimes combined with lithium to increase its effect. Some people find that taking either medication alone causes problems with memory. This is because both medications interact. For this reason, it's important to discuss these with your doctor. \nMirtazapine. Mirtazapine is one of several antipsychotics prescribed to help manage symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Some studies show that mirtazapine can cause serious liver problems. Taking this medicine before bedtime can also reduce libido and arousal. This does not affect sexual function so, depending upon how often this pill is taken, it may make sex more difficult. If this occurs, it may require counseling. Other research suggests that this medication can lead to the development of a tolerance which may result in increasing dosage over time. Most experts agree that mirtazapine must be titrated up or down to maintain optimal effectiveness. You might consider taking mirtazapine","Your answer is as follows:

However, it also has important implications about your risk of complications during chemotherapy. For most people who undergo chemotherapy, their outlook for the rest of their lives remains very positive. Many have a much longer time ahead of them than expected for completing chemotherapy; however, there are some individuals whose outcomes are unpredictable due to factors such as genetic predisposition, prior treatment experiences, and ongoing illnesses. If you know someone who has undergone chemotherapy, talk to them about their experience with chemo. Some people may need more monitoring from chemo therapy because of possible side effects of other treatments at earlier stages of the disease. Also, remember that many doctors will refer you to other specialists when you become sicker and receive additional chemotherapy. Even if you do not experience adverse events, it's still advisable to monitor your progress and adjust your dose or schedule of medication to keep your condition under control. Anecdotal reports suggest that a number of individuals who had received additional or delayed chemotherapy were able to overcome adverse reactions without becoming ill during this time. As you age, the rate of cancer recurrence increases and the likelihood of developing additional cancers increases. In addition, some medications used to treat advanced breast cancer (pemetrexed) or pancreatic cancer may interact with certain other drugs used to treat cancer. There are also many types of chemotherapy drugs available today which contain different chemicals. The only thing that always stays constant with any new drug is its ability to produce significant harm. In addition, there is no guarantee that all therapies will work for everyone, even those who are receiving the right kind of therapy. Therefore, many patients choose to stay on the current treatment regimen until they have been through all the testing and follow up necessary to determine whether the drugs are actually working.

Answer Question: What are the risk factors for myopic eye disease? Complete Answer: There are a number of risk factors that may increase your chance of developing ocular glaucoma; such as smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, and an unhealthy diet. In addition, many people who develop glaucoma have genetic problems that can predispose them to it. For example, if you inherit two copies of a defective gene called RASF4, which produces abnormal retinal pigment epithelial growth factor (RPE), your chances of developing glaucoma rise significantly. If you also have high levels of another vitamin K-dependent protein called ubiquinone, you are at greater risk for developing glaucoma because of its ability to inhibit RPE production. People with some inherited risk factors may not be able to produce enough RPE to prevent their eyes from becoming infected by Glaucoma bacteria. And even those individuals whose genetics make them susceptible may still be able to get glaucoma without any signs of infection.

Question: How do I decide whether to treat my chronic migraine headaches with medication? Complete Answer: You must first evaluate your condition before considering medication. Treatment with medications does not provide full relief from symptoms so you should start looking at other options after you determine that you have persistent headaches that persist despite treatment. Many medicines work well when used properly and safely for a limited amount of time. Others cause side effects or adverse reactions that require stopping therapy early. Sometimes they don't work at all when prescribed. Your doctor will discuss possible alternatives with you when you see him or her. Ask your doctor for advice on how long to wait between taking drugs and treatments, what doses to take, how often to use the pills, and whether to continue using them. Your doctor may suggest medications that are considered safe but not always effective.

Provide useful, complete, and scientifically-grounded answers to common consumer search queries about health.\nQuestion: stage 4 triple negative breast cancer treatment\nComplete Answer:","You will need this information in order to understand what your doctor has recommended for you and how to best proceed with the treatment plan that is right for you.\nQuestion: What is a medical debt? Complete Answer: A medical debt is an amount owed by you or another individual as compensation for a service rendered. Your medical debts can be incurred when doctors perform services on you that they do not have authority to provide (e.g., hospitalization). You should also be aware of what types of treatment may be covered by insurance coverage.\nQuestion: Do I need to pay back my credit card interest if it was charged more than $50? \nAnswer: Yes, you must pay your balance due each month regardless of whether you receive any payments from the creditor. It is important to remember that some creditors will refuse to honor a payment request from someone who does not pay their bill each month. However, most creditors will still honor a request made directly to them, so it's often better to contact the creditor first before making such a claim. The creditor usually has many different ways of paying off your account. Many cards, including those issued by banks or credit unions, allow you to make payments through direct deposit. If you are having difficulty getting your money out quickly, a personal loan can be a good option. It takes time to repay a student loan, but there are no monthly charges associated with a personal loan. Some loans require you to put up a certain amount every week, and other lenders offer monthly installments on a schedule. You could even find a mortgage company that offers mortgages on the same terms as payday loans. Most people agree that making regular monthly payments is a good thing to do. Keep in mind that your financial situation may change over time. For example, if you moved out of state and lost your job, you might be forced to re-establish yourself financially. Also, some companies charge additional fees and/or require you to pay a percentage of the purchase price of goods or services while under contract. To help manage your financial life, consider seeking assistance from a professional counselor or financial advisor. With time, you will learn the details of your finances and will be able to set realistic goals to achieve success.

QUESTION: Should I try to get pregnant at night if I'm depressed or anxious? Should I try to lose weight if I feel fatigued during the day? Complete Answer: No, pregnancy after taking a mood stabilizer or antidepressant does not decrease depression symptoms. While you will likely experience fatigue and a","The best choice for this patient is to have the surgery as soon as possible after diagnosis of Stage 4 triple negative breast cancer. This surgery may be done either before or after chemotherapy has been begun. As with any surgical procedure, there will be no postoperative side effects from this surgery. The only other side effect that will occur is an increased risk of infection, but this is easily managed through proper use of antibiotics. Any infections that do develop should be treated immediately by using appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis. After a thorough physical examination of the patient (including breast self-exams), it is generally recommended that the patient undergo some type of radiation therapy. Radiation can be administered via CT scan, X-ray, MRI, or laser beam therapy. If the cancerous tissue in the breast is large enough to require multiple treatments, these treatments can also be performed. In general, it makes sense to begin treatment within 72 hours of receiving the initial report from the primary care physician.

Question: I am pregnant and need to find out if my doctor prescribes birth control pills for me. Does she recommend them? What are they called? Answer: No, the pills mentioned above are not approved for use during pregnancy. You might want to ask your pharmacist which pill(s) is right for you. It is wise to discuss the medication choices with your obstetrician/gynecologist prior to making those decisions. In addition, it would probably be beneficial to consult a family practitioner who knows more about all of your personal lifestyle issues than just about anyone else on staff.

QUESTION: How long does it take to get through school when I'm at the college level? For example, how long does it usually take to graduate high school or college? Answer: About 15 years! That's quite a bit longer than most people think. Just recently we heard of one man whose graduation took over six months. Although many students graduate very quickly, there are many others who graduate much later than expected. Most often, our information comes from graduating high school seniors who graduated between 1996 and 1999. However, we did hear of an earlier student who graduated in 2000! We hope this information helps.

Treatment Information

Q1) How long will I be able to expect my treatment? Can you give me specific dates and times? A1) Currently, most patients undergoing chemotherapy have their treatment scheduled between two weeks and six months after diagnosis. However, there are some patients who require longer treatment periods than that as they progress along their disease path. It has been estimated that over 25% of all cases of triple negative breast cancer are treated for up to 8 years. Q2) What would happen if I were to develop a new form of cancer during my treatment? This could occur because of genetic changes or because of the use of hormone therapy. In such cases, it is very important that we know what kind of changes are occurring in order to make informed decisions regarding treatment options. Q3) Will I be taking any medications while receiving my treatment? Most patients are encouraged to take some medication during the course of their treatment but it should always be kept to a minimum to ensure the best possible quality of life. Q4) Do I need to stay on hormonal treatment for a year? No. Although the effects of these drugs can linger for quite some time, the majority of patients will only need to maintain them for 2-6 months per year until they begin to decline. This includes hormone replacement therapy, which should be discontinued when the patient no longer needs it. Q5) I am not yet diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer. Are there any other types of cancers that can be reversed by using hormones? Yes. Patients with ovarian, uterine and kidney cancer can also receive hormonal therapy so long as they continue to follow the regimen recommended by their doctor. There are currently no studies showing that hormone therapy reverses lymphoma. Q6) What if I do not wish to take estrogen or testosterone during my treatment? At present, there are no available alternatives","http://www.cdb.gov/sites/default/files/health_information/rpt/medical%20advice%20for%20people%20with%20cancer%20treatment.pdf \nQuestion: how much does it cost to get pregnant? Complete Answer: $80-$180, depending on your insurance policy and the type of pregnancy you have. For example, if you've been diagnosed with breast cancer in January or February, the average costs for prenatal care may be significantly less than $200, while the average costs for postpartum care may be several hundred dollars. It's also important to note that some insurance companies will cover birth control at no charge during your first two years after diagnosis (or up to six months, depending upon the plan). To find out more information about pregnancy in general, see our section on Pregnancy Costs. \nQuestion: I'm getting cancer treatment and am not sure what the side effects might be. What should I do? Complete Answer: There is currently little research on the long term effects of chemotherapy treatments for breast cancer. However, studies suggest that women who undergo chemotherapy for early stages of the disease may experience a number of adverse events such as nausea, fatigue, headaches, depression, and hair loss. See the Center for Disease Control for more information on these issues. In addition, there is considerable controversy over whether chemo can improve survival rates from metastatic breast cancer. Many researchers now believe that chemotherapy can only prolong life by decreasing symptoms and improving quality of life; however, more research is needed. A large randomized clinical trial of women treated with chemotherapy found a reduction in hospitalizations, but did not show any improvement in overall survival rate. Other research shows little benefit for cancer patients treated with chemotherapy for advanced breast cancers. The American Cancer Society provides more information regarding this topic.","You have received information from the FDA that the following treatments do not help in reducing the risk of developing triple negative breast cancer:


1) Inhibiting estrogen production by the liver or ovaries.


2) Reducing the number of estrogens produced by the body through the use of hormone therapy.


3) Estrogen replacement therapy (hRT).


4) Using oral contraceptives such as the Pill.


5) Increasing exposure to ultraviolet light which can increase levels of free radicals in cells.


6) Treating patients with radiation therapy.


7) Increasing the amount of bile acids produced in the digestive tract so they can be used for digestion.


8) Decreasing the amount of cholesterol produced by the body.


9) Combining HRT and aspirin. \nThe most effective way to decrease your risk of getting triple negative breast cancer is to reduce your intake of fats. Fat does not cause breast cancer. It is the type of fat found in animal foods such as butter and cream, oils, and some margarines that causes the cancer. The fat that causes the cancer is cholesterol and has no relation to the amount of saturated fat found in foods and beverages. The only thing you should avoid is using animal products containing meat or any other types of fatty animals. There is no evidence to suggest that eating an egg increases your risk of getting triple negative breast cancer. If you want to get tips on how to lower your risk of developing triple negative breast cancer, read our Health Tips page. \nIf you have never been treated for breast cancer and would like to learn more about what treatments work best, please review the list below and choose one of the suggestions below: 1) Breast exam (scans of both breasts and breast tissue, mammograms) 2) Bilateral mastectomy 3) Radiotherapy (using x-rays and/or radio waves). This will help to prevent future recurrence of breast cancer. You may need additional surgery at some point if the cancer has spread to adjacent sites. Your surgeon must decide whether or not you need additional surgical procedures to control the disease and prevent further recurrences. For this reason, it is important that you discuss your options with your surgeon before beginning treatment. 4) A biopsy, a procedure where tissue samples are taken from inside of your chest to see the extent of the tumor. 5) Radiation therapy. It uses x-ray beams to destroy tumor cells. 6) Surgery. 7) Surgical removal","A single course of radiation therapy is the most effective option for this rare disease, but the risks of complications include long term liver damage, bone marrow rejection, heart failure, and lung metastases. You can find more information on the treatment options at www.breastcancertreatments.org/treatment.html. Question: Should I get a mammogram before getting pregnant? Complete Answer: You should be tested prior to being pregnant because there is no evidence that regular screening improves pregnancy outcomes; if you do decide to have your baby screened, follow your doctor's advice regarding the best way to receive the test. There are no studies indicating that routine mammograms improve your chances of having healthy children or grandchildren. However, some women who want to avoid testing may consider postponing their childbearing until after they reach menopause because testing is less likely to detect early signs of breast cancer, such as high-grade lesions. In general, you will be better off not having any risk factors for breast cancer before age 50 (except in women under age 40 with a family history). If you must get a mammogram after age 50, take it after a year has passed since you stopped smoking or quit drinking alcohol. See the Breast Cancer Screening page for further information. Question: What is the difference between estrogen and progestin in my pill form? Complete Answer: Both estrogen and progestin are hormones used by women to control the menstrual cycle and induce ovulation. For example, an oral contraceptive containing estrogen causes ovulation and the release of estrogen into the bloodstream. Progestin also induces ovulation and leads to the release of progesterone. The two hormones act on different receptors in cells throughout your body. Estrogen is found primarily in the ovaries, while progestin predominates in the adrenal glands. It takes effect right away when taken along with other hormone replacement therapies. Women taking estrogen only during their periods may experience side effects such as hot flashes, mood swings, headaches, muscle aches, stomach problems, nausea, bloating, headache, weight gain, vaginal dryness, breast tenderness, breast discharge, fatigue, insomnia, and dizziness. Because progestin is involved in several types of ovarian and uterine cancers, doctors often use both estrogen and progestin together. Most of these effects are reversible once you stop taking the drugs, however, there are no approved treatments that prevent these side effects. Ask your doctor how much progestin to take every day and how long to continue to take each dose","If you are undergoing triple negative hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen alone or in combination with progestin, then your doctor may be referring to the following information to help guide your decision regarding this specific type of HRT. Your doctor will likely also provide general information on how to obtain additional, more comprehensive information. The information provided below is for informational purposes only; it does not take into account any particular circumstances or patient needs. This information should not substitute for consulting your physician in regards to questions related specifically to these types of drugs, products, or procedures. You should not take this information as an indication that you should stop taking any medications at the time of receiving this information, although this is unlikely. Please refer to other relevant sources, including any prior prescriptions or orders, previous lab tests, and your own personal experience and opinions.\n\nQuestion: I have been asked by my doctor if I want to continue with hormone replacement therapy after six months. What is the best way to know what to expect? Complete Answer: At this point, it's very important for all patients to speak with their doctors before initiating hormonal therapy for gender reassignment surgery because certain side effects can occur during periods when hormones are being taken. In addition to the risks associated with the administration of hormones in excess amounts over long periods of time, there are many serious complications of these treatments that must be addressed before they begin. This includes the possibility of depression, which can be especially problematic for patients who are experiencing a difficult transition from one gender role to another. Additionally, the risk of thrombosis increases significantly upon testosterone treatment, particularly in elderly men who have low blood pressure. There are even cases of severe liver problems associated with testosterone use.

The endocrine system, which controls most biological processes throughout our bodies, works differently in males than females. When testosterone is used for a short period of time, the body produces ""testosterone-like"" substances called estrogens; however, women produce both male and female sex steroids--androgen, progesterone, and others. Estrogen makes up 80% of the total male reproductive hormone production and 90% of the total female reproductive hormone production. With increasing age, the rate of the accumulation of either sex steroid decreases. Consequently, the aging process leads to lower levels of the sex steroids (which can cause changes to skin, hair, nails, bone structure, etc.). These changes to the skeleton increase the likelihood of osteoporosis in some individuals. While estrogen plays a protective role against oste","For patients who have advanced stages of triple negative (BRCA1/2) breast cancer in whom there is no effective therapy, we recommend that you receive both chemotherapy plus radiotherapy for the early phase of treatment because this approach provides the most favorable clinical outcomes. In addition, with all the improvements in our treatment modalities over the past decade, we can now reliably predict whether or not a patient will respond to either radiation or chemotherapy. We encourage everyone who has questions about their treatment options to discuss them with your oncologist at the time of their first visit to see if they can provide more information regarding which option might be right for them.

Provide useful, complete, and scientifically-grounded answers to common consumer search queries about health.\nQuestion: best pillow neck pain\nComplete Answer:","no - a pillow will not protect the neck from any sort of injury. If you've had one of these, then there's nothing that can be done for it but find out what caused it and get rid of it. As an alternative, if your pillow has been in this position long enough, you might try using some kind of elastic band on the back side. The elastic band can hold more tension than a firm pillow will (and thus reduce the likelihood of further stress on the neck), so you can place them side by side on your pillow as needed. \n\nQuestion: how much water should I drink before bed? Complete Answer: You do not need to drink anything until you're asleep or unconscious, but drinking is often recommended before going to sleep so that you don't feel drowsy during the night and have less chance of falling asleep. So even though you may want to stay awake overnight, you'll only see a slight increase in body temperature and probably not enough to cause problems unless you just start drinking too much in the morning. There's also a possibility that your body needs extra fluids to flush toxins out of its system, so if you happen to be taking medications, they won't work well unless you drink more than normal. \n \nQuestion: How many calories does a light bulb burn each time it burns up? Complete Answer: This depends upon how large the bulbs were and how bright they were. A typical incandescent bulb (50 watts) is about 2,200 lumens per square inch of area (about 50 times brighter than the sun). If you take those numbers and multiply by 2,000, you get 2 million lumens. That means that when you throw a 100 watt incandescent bulb into your house every day for seven years, you'd end up with 1 million lumens. To calculate how many lumens of light are burning per year, simply divide the number of hours you spend sitting in front of the fluorescent tube in question by the number of hours you spend looking at the bulb. For example, a 100 watt bulb would burn off around 200 lumens of energy per hour. If you were burning a 200 watt bulb, you'd burn 4,400,000,000 lumens of energy per year. It would take over four billion years for that amount of energy to be converted to heat, so the next time you look at a 100 watt bulb you might as well go home now! If you think this gives you a bad idea about using 100 watt bulbs, think","the most common reason for this is from pressure on the back of your head and neck muscles. This pressure can be caused by any number of things such as a blow to your head, falling asleep while wearing sleepwear, or being hit in an accident. It usually goes away after a few days, but it could be something you have to deal with over time. If your head isn't causing problems, don't worry, just get some good sleep and everything will work itself out. If you do have trouble sleeping, try this simple remedy: take 5 minutes to lie down in bed for 20 minutes every night. When you come to, lay back down and relax your body so that you feel comfortable. Do not use pillows or blankets, because they are too soft. Try using a blanket or mattress instead.

Question: How can I keep my hair up?\nAnswer: You need to learn how to control your hair, whether it's curly, wavy, thick, thin, or fine. Many women find themselves struggling with their hair because they cannot seem to figure out what works best. Here are several ways to help: 1) Start by focusing on controlling your hair. For example, if you want short hair, start by pulling a comb through your hair at least twice a day. 2) Look for products that make your scalp more sensitive (e.g., silicones). These chemicals help protect your scalp from dryness during drying. 3) Stay away from shampoos or conditioners that contain harsh ingredients such as parabens, sulfates, or phthalates (which may also contribute to allergies). 4) Use moisturizers which provide moisture without added chemicals. Examples include coconut oil, jojoba oil, aloe vera gel, almond milk, apricot kernels, grape seed extract, rosehip seed oil, safflower oil, and avocado oils. 5) Take steps toward better sleep hygiene practices such as washing your hands before eating, showering, and dressing yourself. 6) Cut out the stress factor by taking frequent breaks throughout the day. 7) Practice good habits like exercising regularly, making healthy food choices, cleaning your home, getting enough rest, and avoiding stressors such as excessive noise, heavy traffic, stressful environments, bad weather, and unhealthy foods (eating too much sugar or candy may cause headaches). 8) Stop smoking! This habit can negatively affect your brain function, increase your risk of developing cancer, and contribute to many other diseases. 9) Avoid alcohol.

Q: What if I have spinal stenosis? Complete Answer: Your spine can become narrowed by certain types of back problems. As with any type of narrowing in the spine, proper care must occur before surgery is considered. When treating spondylolisthesis, it is important that you receive appropriate physical therapy as soon as possible. It is also important that you get regular follow up visits from your doctor. The risk of complications during and after surgery decreases significantly with timely treatment. However, there still could be some side effects from medications used in addition to those prescribed by your doctor.

Q: How should I treat my lower back pain? Complete Answer: Pain in the lower back often results from a combination of both internal (internal causes) and external (external causes), especially when the problem does not respond to medication. Medication therapy is recommended for most patients who experience upper back pain. Pain relief usually requires a combination of opioid analgesics such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen and nonopioid prescription drugs like morphine, oxycodone, and hydrocodone. Some people use combinations of these medications and nonprescription drugs like antidepressants, benzodiazepines, antihistamines, and antihypertensives to reduce symptoms. In rare cases, pain management with opioids alone is necessary. To find out more about pain management, please call 1-888-227-7233.

Q: Should I consult my healthcare provider regarding my back pain? Complete Answer: Yes. You should consult your healthcare provider right away if you experience symptoms that do not improve on their own or if they worsen over time. Many people think that it's better just to take the easy way out and ignore their chronic pain. Unfortunately, this approach is not always effective. For example, many people experience improvement without medical intervention once their pain improves through therapy.

The following tips may help you: 1) Sit in front of the TV or radio or computer while reading. 2) Get into bed right away if there is any light that comes through the window. 3) Keep an eye on how much time goes by without movement. 4) Try to lie still when you have to pee, cough, sneeze, eat food, etc. 5) When the light gets stronger, try to keep moving the chair and other furniture around so that it does not disturb the rest of your body. 6) If you find yourself in more than one position, then just move to another position with less distraction. 7) Do not fall asleep before 7pm because that will prolong your symptoms and possibly even lead to more severe pain later on. 8) Take breaks when necessary and don't be too tired after. 9) Use the bathroom as often as needed. 10) Avoid overdoing the medications since they tend to make things worse. 11) Do not use alcohol when you feel uncomfortable or unable to sleep. 12) Stay hydrated throughout the day. 13) Make sure that the room temperature is constant. 14) Never leave home before 8am unless absolutely necessary. 15) Don't let children play outside with toys or household items until the child has calmed down. 16) If you know someone who wants to quit smoking, please tell them to smoke only once every four hours. 17) Be careful when using alcohol. 18) Eat well and drink lots of water. 19) Find out where all the bathrooms are in your house beforehand. 20) You should not listen to music on headphones while driving. 21) Keep your clothes dry. 22) Make sure the air conditioning works properly. 23) Check for lice at least twice a year to prevent their spread. 24) Make sure your car seat fits snugly. 25) Keep track of the current weather and take appropriate precautions. 26) Take your medication regularly. 27) Watch out for dangerous people/animals. 28) Call 911 if your symptoms become serious. 29) Stay away from noisy areas, especially if they might attract birds. 30) Do not go to high places (like airports). 31) Remember that your doctor is very concerned about your safety. 32) Sleep on your back, and hold the pillows close to your chest. 33) Don't get up from a sleeping position","Painful spasms of the spine due to low back or pelvic floor muscle weakness caused by low back pain/discomfort. This pain can vary in severity, but is often caused by a spinal stenosis (a narrowing). The spasm may cause an individual to feel pain when standing up, sitting down, bending over, or lying on their side. The symptoms also include increased movement of the extremities, numbness, tingling, burning, tingling sensations, difficulty moving muscles from one position to another, or other discomfort. It might be related to other conditions such as sciatica, hip dysplasia, and chronic low back pain that does not respond to treatment.\r


Answers provided by Dr. Krizman: 1) When you ask if it hurts when you stand up, this refers to the area of your lower back (back) where there is a nerve called the Valsalva maneuver (VAM), which moves through your spine and connects with the diaphragm. If someone has difficulty standing or walking for any reason, they should see a doctor immediately. 2) When you ask what the pain feels like, this means feeling a sharp throbbing sensation along with muscle tension and mild numbness or pain at times. 3) When you ask how bad it is, this refers to having soreness, numbness, tightness or tenderness at times. 4) Sometimes people think they have a muscle ache or a headache when they just lie down. This is because the brain interprets these as ""muscle pains"". You cannot tell whether this is caused by a muscle ache or a headache until you try to stand or walk. 5) Some people say that they are having back spasms or stiffness if they sit down for any length of time. There is no science behind this. 6) A lot of people believe that they can't sleep without their pillows because their heads hurt. Unfortunately, most people who suffer from insomnia do not realize that they are suffering from low back pain, and therefore don't know how to seek help. 7) Many people believe that if they sleep well, their backs will naturally relax after taking a sleeping pill. This is not true. Your body's natural tendency is to make you tense during sleep. So it makes sense that you would become tired while asleep. 8) Most women report that their breasts get very hot when they wear sleeveless shirts. This is probably because they are rubbing against a large group of blood vessels. 9","yes\nQuestion: should I buy an insurance plan or not?\nAnswer: you must be insured in order for a physician to write prescriptions to any patient who asks for one, but if your insurance does cover it, then the insurance company will pay for it. If your insurance doesn't cover it, you have nothing to worry about.\nQuestion: is my knee worth $500/year?\nThe answer is no, except that it's more expensive than the average American's salary. You can check out our handy guide below to find out how much your knee costs in real dollars.\nQuestion: do you have to take any medications while sleeping?\nIf yes, what is they?\nQuestion: if I sleep with just me and the TV on, how many hours per night do I actually sleep? How long does a single night last? What happens when I wake up? Do I get all of the dreams I've had the previous day or do I only dream about the things that happen during the daytime? Complete Answer: A single night lasts anywhere from 6 hours to over 8 hours depending on how tired you are at the time. The difference between 6 hours and 8 hours depends on whether or not you slept through it.\nQuestion: do I need to stay up past midnight? If so, how often do I need to go back to bed?\nYes, you need to stay up past midnight. Once people started getting into bed by 12pm (as they say), they stopped going back to sleep till well after 10 pm, which makes sense since the body needs rest to repair itself. So, if someone got up at 2am, he would still need some recovery time before his body could recover fully. If you stayed awake until 11:30 am, you wouldn't even notice that you'd missed the hourglass.\nQuestion: I heard there was something called a ""nightmare"" after eating food. Is this true?\nNo, though most people don't realize it. People can tell when they're hungry because their stomachs start to turn as soon as they feel full. Nightmare comes from how quickly you eat. There's usually no reason to be afraid of having a hard meal, unless you were already ravenous by the time you took your first bite. This is why you hear people talking about having a ""bad nightmare"" about things like being stuck inside a refrigerator, or falling asleep when they shouldn't have. When you're having a bad nightmare","The safest way to sleep is on your back, not any other position. If you have a good night's rest and you can make it to bed without falling asleep on the couch or at the side of the sofa, then you should take that as your new sleeping position. However, if you feel uncomfortable lying down on your back, it may be time for an adjustment to more comfortable positions that will allow you to get a better night's sleep.


There are many different reasons for which people tend to fall asleep while standing up from their beds, so we would like to answer some questions that may help you find what position works best for you.


Sitting or laying down when asleep may lead to problems with your body because there is less blood circulation through the limbs, causing numbness and tingling in these areas. Also, the amount of pressure placed upon the head and neck by gravity during the sitting stage decreases, and this reduces the sensation of pressure around the eyes, nose, and mouth, making them difficult to breathe normally when awake. This leads to breathing difficulties in the morning.


Also, because the body has been accustomed to being upright all day long, the muscles in the lower extremities (especially the thighs) become fatigued and weak. As a result, the legs move backward or forward instead of upward (in an attempt to keep balance), increasing the chance of falls. This can also cause back problems, particularly if you have a history of back problems.


The reason why people sometimes fall asleep while lying down is because they are usually too tired to move well enough to avoid slipping out of bed. This can happen even if one is moving to the bathroom before waking up, or if one is eating breakfast while taking a nap; either of these actions can cause slippage into the prone position. A combination of exhaustion, reduced movement, and poor posture can prevent people from getting into a natural state of sleep. So, instead of trying to wake yourself up, try doing something else first.


If you do decide to lie down while sleeping, make sure to lay as flat as possible (not leaning backwards). You want to make sure that you are not laying upside down on the mattress, and you can use the same mattress as normal in order to avoid having one side of your mattress touch the floor.

Provide useful, complete, and scientifically-grounded answers to common consumer search queries about health.\nQuestion: numb fingers arthritis\nComplete Answer:","This is an abnormal pain in the muscles that surround your fingertips. The symptoms of this disorder usually develop as you get older. It can range from slight discomfort to deep irritation and sometimes even permanent damage. You may have numbness on one or both hands and it's very common for people with this condition to find themselves unable to do things like write, hold up books, lift heavy objects, fold clothes, or use a computer keyboard. What causes this? People who suffer from chronic low back pain often experience loss of muscle tone in their lower extremities. In most cases, when these muscles weaken, they tend to become permanently damaged over time.

The culprit is inflammation. When your body doesn't produce enough natural painkillers, the body starts to fight off the infection causing the pain. But too much inflammatory response (which happens naturally) also tends to lead to degeneration of your nerves, which ultimately leads to numbness in those parts of your hand that aren't covered by skin.\nQuestion: I've had a hard time sleeping and I'm getting headaches and sleepiness all the time. Do I need to go see a doctor? Complete Answer: You probably should be seeing a doctor if your insomnia is severe or lasts more than three nights a week. If you're having trouble falling asleep at night without some other form of help, talk to your doctor or therapist immediately. They'll make recommendations for what kind of treatment might help. Some types of medications, such as benzodiazepines, may help some patients and won't affect others. Ask whether any drugs prescribed for high blood pressure are OK for you. Many medications used for sleep problems can cause dangerous side effects such as heart disease, stroke, and cancer, so always consult with your doctor before starting any medication. \nQuestion: My wife has been trying to keep me awake since last night. She says she thinks we should be taking some sort of prescription drug to wake us up but there's nothing on our pill bottles. Do you think it would work? Complete Answer: That seems like a pretty good idea! A study published in 2002 found that if you gave people a morning dose of a mild stimulant, such as dextroamphetamine, the likelihood of going to bed early increased dramatically. So perhaps there could be an effective way to prevent or lessen your partner's attempts to wake you up, whether via sudden snoring or banging on the bedroom door.

If you're worried about waking up someone else while you're sleeping, try saying something like ""I","This is an old question and I do not know if this can be answered with an answer that does not depend on the person's age. There may be other causes of non-specific muscle pain which have similar symptoms but with different underlying causes. A doctor or nurse should see you for a general checkup in order to rule out more serious conditions like osteoarthritis.\nQuestion: what is ""stomach cramps"" and how can i prevent them?\nAnswer: If your stomach is full after eating, it may feel uncomfortable, especially if you eat fast food or sweets at the same time. It may also make your stomach itch, especially when you first try eating something. But these symptoms usually disappear within 5 minutes. You might want to drink water before lunch and then again as soon as possible after breakfast. Some people may experience abdominal discomfort if they have their stomach turned upside down while chewing gum or using an oral contraceptive pill (like Plan B One Shot). The cause of this unpleasant sensation can vary depending on your age and sex. Your child may or may not have it; most women never do.\nQuestion: What are the symptoms of flu and what should I do if im sick with it?\nAnswer: Flu can cause cold sweats and chills, nausea, fever, headache, neck stiffness, dizziness, dry mouth, body aches, irritability, fatigue, weakness, joint pains, loss of appetite, and vomiting. These symptoms will go away on their own over several days to weeks if you stay home from work or school or take a few days off. However, you need to get better quickly in order to avoid the long term complications of seasonal influenza, including pneumonia, hospitalization, and death.\nQuestion: How can I stop bleeding?\nAnswer: Do not let blood clot in any part of your body except where your skin meets your upper lip. Use an anticoagulant medicine such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, meloxicam, gabapentin, and others to control or reduce bleeding problems for a few days to weeks. Then follow up by checking your bleeding regularly. Stop taking your medication as directed. Never stop bleeding with medicines for heart disease because it has been linked to heart attack. In addition to avoiding being hospitalized, you could be able to protect yourself from the flu by not going to work until you feel well and staying home during the month of April. \nQuestion: Can a man who has sex with men","A non-musculoskeletal disorder characterized by the loss of sensation in the digits (fingers) due to nerve damage and tissue degeneration.

Lansing, MI 48109","Ankylosing spondylitis (inflamed tendons or ligaments of the arm) is an inflammation of the connective tissue in your muscles and tendons. It can occur when there's a buildup of pus around your joint as well as when your body reacts to pain by producing inflammatory proteins called cytokines. The main types of inflammation you may be seeing include those that cause redness, swelling, tenderness, or muscle stiffness, which are symptoms of other conditions. Other causes of inflammation include injury, infection, stress, cold, heat, high altitude, and many medications for disorders such as diabetes. Ankylosing spondylitis occurs most often in people with arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. It doesn't affect everyone, but it is more likely if you have any one or more of these conditions: arthritic (paralysis)

rheumatic (damage from chronic friction to joints)

arthritis (tendon damage or ulceration)

kidney disease

lupus

infectious diseases.

What are the signs and symptoms? Ankylosing spondylitis usually appears over time, typically within a year or two after the initial symptom. However, sometimes the first symptoms aren't noticed until months later. They're also different depending on what type of inflammation is causing them. Some symptoms depend upon the location of the inflammation: Inflamed, inflamed tendon

Tender, swollen tendons and/or ligaments

Red or blistered skin and/or soft tissues

Pain that moves up into your shoulder

A throbbing or burning sensation in your lower back

The inflammation may be worse on days where your body makes certain chemicals known as prostaglandins. These chemicals bind to receptors in the nerves that control movement and help keep blood flowing throughout the body. This helps reduce pain during exercise and helps prevent injuries caused by repetitive strain injuries (RSIs).

When should I see my doctor? You should seek urgent treatment before you notice a change in your symptoms. Your doctor will perform tests to check for any underlying condition that might make things worse or worsen your symptoms. If you notice changes in the way your body responds to something you eat, drink, smoke, or touch — such as the feeling of pressure in your legs, arms, or face — you should see your doctor right away.

If your symptoms don't improve immediately, contact your doctor right away. Treatment will begin","The primary cause of this problem is that the nerve cells in your wrist do not properly surround the bone on the top of the finger, causing it to become deformed when you twist or bend the hand. You can try doing this exercise for at least 10 minutes each day with no problems. Also, if there is inflammation around the area where the nerves have been damaged, see an orthopedist immediately.\endquote>

And one last tip. Make sure your thumb isn't cut off by some form of surgery before applying these instructions!","Your question is very similar to one I have asked in the past. In that case, you would be doing yourself a disservice by ignoring your doctor's advice. This isn't an exhaustive list of possible problems for which physicians can prescribe drugs. The key thing to remember here is that this information is only for consumers who already know what their doctor has recommended or are willing to make an effort to learn more. Many other problems can affect people with chronic pain; you might want to consult an osteopath for guidance on specific areas where they feel comfortable recommending medication. A medical diagnosis is the best indicator of a person's ability to avoid further harm from excessive drug use. It is not the sole determinant of whether someone will benefit from using a particular substance.\nQuestion: I was told that if it wasn't a life threatening condition, I should not take any medications. Is this true? Complete Answer: It depends on how serious you think the problem may be. If you're having difficulty breathing, it could be time to consider some form of oxygen therapy. But even though the situation is less severe than breathing difficulties caused by certain medical conditions, it doesn't necessarily mean that you shouldn't seek help. There are situations when taking prescription drugs is appropriate - just as there are situations where we recommend avoiding them. You must weigh all potential risks carefully before making decisions like these. For example, some medical procedures require taking pills every day, while others do not. Some medications are extremely dangerous (like narcotics) and should always be used under close supervision. Other drugs aren't really prescribed at all, such as those that cause seizures. When choosing between two options, try to pick one that is most likely to produce benefit (for both you and your doctors).\nQuestion: Why is there so much misinformation out there on the Internet? Complete Answer: Most of the information contained on the Web about medications is outdated or incorrect. Doctors often recommend medications based on anecdotal evidence alone. This means that no real data exists about what actually works for your individual patient. The fact is that there is considerable variation among patients in response to the same treatment. So if you see an article saying that aspirin helps with joint pains, don't believe it. What you will find is that many doctors don't think that aspirin is effective. And if your patient is resistant, then it's hard to justify prescribing it. While some medicines work well at first, we need to accept that it won't be long before our treatments become ineffective due to side effects.

What causes an itch on the fingernails and the tips of the toes? Dryness of the nails or excessive sweating \r

\r

Answer: While most people get their nails wet through the use of water polishes or spray lacquers, some can actually cause itching even without being exposed to these types of products. Some common sources of itching include, but are not limited to:\r

\r

Sitting at desks where there is too much wind to dry out the surface; \r

Is there a cure for scratching your nails? Yes! There are several treatments available for many different conditions. The most common is an anti-itch cream that contains ingredients such as acetylsalicylic acid. This product has been shown to reduce itching as well as pain, so if your symptoms persist, try taking some of this medicine along with your other medicines.

The pain is caused by the abnormal movement of the finger joints. The cause is unknown.


SUMMARY OF THE ANSWER

Pain in the hands is a result of an overactive sensory system that causes swelling, damage or loss of nerve cells, the nerves that control voluntary muscle action, as well as pain transmission between adjacent structures (such as the muscles). The body's natural response to painful stimuli is pain sensation itself, not the presence or absence of pain receptors on the affected tissue. It has been suggested that these receptors have evolved for defense against infection or injury and therefore may be less sensitive than those involved in involuntary muscle movements such as walking, reaching for objects, etc.[11] Pain perception involves the brain, spinal cord, and endocrine systems - all of which play a significant role in how we perceive pain.\nQuestion: my doctor says that I should not use certain medicines because they can increase my risk of kidney stones\nAnswer: If you're thinking of taking any medications with caffeine, such as energy drinks, coffee, tea, cola, etc., think again! Some drugs that are thought to raise your risk of developing kidney stones include alcohol, aspirin, and the antacids used in some cold medicine. Additionally, certain antibiotics, corticosteroids, antihistamines, diuretics, antipsychotics, sedatives, sleeping pills, and steroidal hormones like birth control pills will raise your risk of developing kidney stones.


WHAT TO DO NEXT

When looking for information on potential side effects from medications, it helps to keep in mind the following guidelines:

Look up the drug's name and dosage information. You'll find out what kind of dosage is recommended for each medication, whether the drug affects blood pressure, heart rate, blood sugar levels, appetite, sexual function, or other related symptoms. Look up the manufacturer's label information. This might contain warnings about high doses or interactions, the maximum daily dose, and more. Make sure that the side effect information is based on real data, rather than rumors. Also make sure that the information contains the most current information available. For example, if you were told to take a particular medication after having surgery or when you received chemotherapy for cancer treatment, this isn't always true. When looking at the ingredients list, don't just look for one substance; try to see all possible combinations.

If none of the above provides enough information to help you decide what you need to do next, get","It is not true that the body can heal itself by removing blood vessels in your joints. The only way for tissues to heal themselves is through a process called microcirculation, which involves the circulation of blood from one part of your body to another. In addition, other types of tissue (such as cartilage) need time before they will be able to reabsorb the blood.

Your web site has been very helpful to me. I have learned more than I ever thought possible about my illness. You provide information that I was unable to find on the internet. Your website is an invaluable resource. Thank you so much!

The first thing that came to mind when I saw your site was ""you've got my back!"" I had a terrible experience with my primary care physician. He refused to listen to any suggestions that I tried. The last few months since then have been a long learning curve for me and I'm finally starting to see improvement.

I started going to your website because of your excellent site and how it helped me understand what's causing my symptoms. Now that I know exactly what the problem is, I'm doing everything possible to correct it.

It appears from your Web page that you don't believe there is a cure. This bothers me greatly, but let me tell you why I feel like curing myself first, before others do.

Some people who have chronic illnesses still think they are cured after having taken certain medicines for months or even years. They seem to forget that there may still be a lot of negative side effects from taking medications that have no effect whatsoever in treating a disease. People often become so upset by these side effects that they never try again. Unfortunately, most of them go on to become chronically ill themselves as a result. However, if we use the right treatments while continuing to maintain our lifestyle, we're more likely to avoid these complications. Asking ""How come nobody is telling me?"" is always the wrong answer to ask.

The U.S. is currently in the midst of an alarming epidemic of autoimmune thyroid disorders (autoimmune thyroiditis) with over 600,000 Americans suffering from one or more cases each year. In fact, according to the National Cancer Institute there are now approximately 1 million new thyroid cancer cases every year alone. One third of those diagnosed were under age 60 at the time of diagnosis! These new diagnoses also occur frequently among women who had not experienced any prior autoimmune thyroid disease.

Treatment options include surgery for menopause replacement (MRS), iodine supplementation (I) and/or thyroid hormone replacement therapy (THR). The current treatment options for thyroid dysfunction including I and/or TH include the following:


Dietary Restriction : While these diets usually focus on controlling blood sugar levels, they do not address the underlying cause which lies within the cells themselves. Unfortunately, modern food processing methods produce foods that contain too much fructose, glucose, and other carbohydrates which triggers immune response causing inflammation and inflammation leading to autoimmunity. This leads to a vicious cycle of chronic inflammation leading to further deterioration of your internal organs causing further damage. A diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy products, legumes, nuts, seeds and alcohol helps reduce inflammation but does not eliminate it. Your body will respond by making more insulin (and less glucagon) which increases appetite leading to weight gain leading to hyperglycemia resulting in metabolic syndrome. As diabetes increases the risk of developing heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, obesity, depression and other health problems associated with autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammation. Thus, lifestyle changes should be made to reduce inflammation.


Anti-Inflammatories : Anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin, Tylenol, acetaminophen and others can help relieve pain due to inflammatory reactions caused by excessive inflammation. However, if you develop arthritis then anti-inflammatories may no longer be effective so a dietary change needs to be made in order to prevent joint pain or osteoarthritis.

Exercise : Although most exercise programs focus on improving cardiovascular fitness in addition to muscle strength and endurance; the opposite is true when it comes to preventing injuries. By getting enough sleep (6+ hours daily) and exercising regularly, we ensure our muscles are functioning properly and avoiding injury. Additionally, some studies indicate that an aerobic workout","\n\nHypothyroidism is the most common of all thyroid disorders; it affects up to 4 percent of women in their 40s.

Complete Answer:\n\nIn people who have not had a child before they reach age 35, a condition known as premenstrual syndrome (PMS) may result in low levels of estrogen and progesterone that can lead to fatigue and weight loss. The hypothalamus secretes two chemicals called gonadotropins; one, follicle stimulating hormone, stimulates the ovaries to release eggs into the fallopian tubes. The other hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), stimulates the uterus to become swollen with a lump. Symptoms of hypo include nausea, vomiting, headache, weight gain, dizziness, sweating, abdominal pain, mood swings, difficulty sleeping, and weakness.\nQuestion: how to treat my thyroid? Complete Answer:\n\nWhile treatments for hypo can vary widely depending on the exact cause of the disorder, generally there are three primary approaches: increasing thyroid function by taking medication; decreasing thyroid activity via diet or supplements; and eliminating thyroid hormones altogether. Each approach involves a different combination of drugs and therapies. Some medications used to decrease thyroid activity include: magnesium sulfate, albendazole, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Many dietary supplements also work to increase thyroid hormone levels. Other methods of treating hypo include: limiting food intake and exercising regularly; supplementing with iodine if your doctor tells you to; and taking an anti-thyroid drug like thiophanate-iodide or niacinamide.

In some cases, the condition can cause depression, lack of concentration, mood swings, difficulty with memory and thinking, trouble sleeping, and other symptoms. Other symptoms include weight gain, hair loss, blurred vision, dry skin, and joint pain. Symptoms may vary by age and gender but many people experience them in their 20s, 30s, and 40s. People with hypothyroidism often have increased resistance to cold and heat. The most important part of your questionnaire will be whether you are having any problems with cold or heat. If so, we recommend you take this quiz as soon as possible. You can begin right away by answering all questions. Question: What causes thyroid cancer? Complete Answer:\nThe primary tumor type for thyroid cancer is adenocarcinoma.\nWhen someone becomes ill with a thyroid cancer, it's called an undiagnosed thyroid cancer. Some experts believe that up to 50% of people with thyroid cancers were not diagnosed until later in life. There are several reasons why people might develop an undiagnosed thyroid cancer, including: \nExposure to radiation from nuclear testing during World War II, which caused iodine deficiency

Genetic predisposition to thyroid cancer

Obesity (especially when accompanied by hyperthyroidism)

Alcohol abuse

Cancer treatments such as radiation therapy or surgery

Chemotherapy

Iodine supplementation

Infection The main risk factor for developing thyroid cancer is hereditary factors. A mutation on one gene may increase the chance of a person getting an undiagnosed case of thyroid cancer. A second genetic change that increases the risk of developing thyroid cancer is mutations in two genes, FOXP2 and SREBP1c. These two genes help regulate the production of thyroid hormones, but they also affect immune function.\nYour doctor may want to test your thyroid levels before trying treatment to see if these changes are related to the condition. If the tests show that you should receive thyroid medication, then your doctor may ask if you would like to start taking one. It's usually best to give each dose once a month. Your doctor may suggest starting at a lower dosage than usual based on how well you feel. If you're starting too high of a dose, you could end up losing more body fat than normal because less gland tissue produces thyroid hormone. For example, a higher dosage of one pill per day may lead to 5","The majority of thyroid patients have only mild, subclinical symptoms that do not necessarily meet the criteria for full clinical diagnosis (e.g., weight loss, excessive tiredness, or changes in sleep patterns). If you suspect your patient may be suffering from a thyroid problem, it is important to perform a thorough physical exam and obtain detailed history on the patient before prescribing any medications. Your results will guide a physician's decision regarding treatment options. For more information, see \http://www.cdc.gov/medwatch/tlds/index_en.html.

Treatment Options:

The following therapies can help patients with severe cases of hyperthyroidism recover their optimal health:


1. Pregnancy management

2. Nerve support therapy

3. Anti-rejection drugs

4. Acupuncture

5. Dietary supplements

6. Herbal medicine

7. Homeopathy

8. Medication (especially Thyroxine HCL (Cytomel))

9. Other

These treatments should be considered with extreme caution by physicians and patients alike. The following factors should also be discussed when considering treatment options:

• Is the patient allergic?

• Are there other underlying conditions such as autoimmune disorders, kidney disease, diabetes, cancer, etc.?

• Has she been diagnosed with depression?

• Has she previously had an autoimmune disorder such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid gland)?

• Will the patient suffer significant side effects due to her medication?

• Do the alternatives adequately treat the primary medical condition?

• Can the current therapeutic regimen be continued without causing serious adverse events?

In addition, some individuals may experience temporary improvement while others may require ongoing support and monitoring until they reach a satisfactory resolution. Although most people who develop hyperthyroidism eventually recover fully, there are always those who relapse and need additional care. In many instances, the initial treatment option does not resolve the severity of symptoms sufficiently so that the individual is ready for surgery. Even if the cause of the symptoms resolves, even then the person may still require additional treatment, including blood transfusions, anti-cancer drug regimens, and lifestyle modifications.","Yes, you have thyroid gland dysfunction that causes your body to produce too much thyroid hormone. Your body must make the extra iodine or other substances in order to use its own metabolism to synthesize thyroid hormones. If you don't consume enough iodized salt (iodine supplementation) to meet your needs, your body will not be able to do this, which can cause increased risks of autoimmune disease such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, anemia and even cancer. You should consult with your physician before taking any supplements containing high levels of iodine because some may contain dangerous amounts of this vital mineral.

Your doctor will prescribe appropriate medication to help reduce the level of harmful thyroid hormone produced by your body.

Do not ignore these warning signs from your health care provider, especially if they start occurring after a stressful period for yourself or someone you love.

Q. Why does my blood count change when I am pregnant? What is causing it?

Answer: It's possible to increase your risk of having a baby with Down syndrome by eating certain foods during pregnancy; however, this condition isn't inherited. The most likely reason for increasing your chances of having a baby with Down syndrome while pregnant is a genetic abnormality called Trisomy 18 (also known as trisomy 16). This condition occurs in one out of every 1,000 babies born. To find out whether your baby has it, your doctor will need to perform a DNA test.

If your baby is born with Trisomy 18, he or she is at an elevated risk of passing it on to future generations through their offspring. However, you do not necessarily have to worry about passing down your child's Trisomy 18 disorder to your children. In fact, many people who carry trisomy 18 are healthy individuals. When combined with another chromosomal disorder called Kyphoscoliosis (which also affects newborns), you might be more prone to having a baby with Down syndrome than you think.


Q. My twin brother was born with normal eyesight, but my sister's eye color is blue. How does this happen?

Answer: As part of a rare phenomenon called mosaicism, both twins share several genes. These genes tend to act differently depending on how the two siblings were brought into the world. This variation usually manifests itself in different colors in each sibling. For example, white hands, fingers, ears, eyes, hair, and skin color are typical. But a black hand or finger bone could be white or","This question can be answered in two ways: First, by providing the full name of the person whose thyroid is affected (usually the first name).

Symptoms may include weight gain, headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, decreased sex drive, blurred vision, rapid heartbeat, low blood pressure, skin rashes, insomnia, depression, constipation, sleep apnea, irritability, joint pain, muscle spasms, dizziness, and muscle weakness. You can also use these questions to determine if you have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (HRT) and other conditions associated with hyperthyroidism. \r

If you think your thyroid is causing these symptoms, talk with your doctor. Your doctor will probably ask you some personal information about your thyroid function and its role in your daily life, including whether you smoke. It may help to bring up this topic at an appointment, but make sure to tell your doctor about any past history of severe thyroid problems (such as Hashimoto's Thyroiditis). She'll then be able to advise you on how to best manage your thyroid symptoms and make recommendations for specific treatment options. \nQuestion: Do I need thyroid medication? Complete Answer: To protect against damage from excessive exposure to iodine, most people who don't have Hashimoto's should not take T4 (the normal form of iodine). However, many patients do not respond well to antihistamines because they reduce the level of iodized salt circulating in their bloodstreams. This increases the risk of hyperthyroidism. In those cases, you might consider getting an iodine supplement, which contains iodine salts and helps prevent iodine deficiency. As a general rule, however, T4 is best used when you aren't taking antihistamines. For more information, see ""How much iodine?"" in Chapter 3. \r

In certain circumstances, such as severe allergies, high levels of thyroid hormones can cause serious harm. So check with your doctor before trying to treat yourself using iodine supplements or even iodinated table salt. \nQuestions: How long does my thyroid function last after being treated with thyroid medicine?\nAnswer: Your thyroid gland takes several months to become fully functional again after treatment. A patient with Hashimoto's will generally experience no symptoms until about two years after starting his/her treatment, during which time he/she will typically be feeling better than usual and able to perform basic tasks like bathing. In the meantime, there is very little data on long-term effects of thyroid therapy, and few studies","The best way to test for thyrotoxicosis is with an objective blood count (CBC). A normal number of thyroid hormones in your bloodstream is defined as one below the upper limit of detection. Thyrotoxicosis occurs when your body has too few or no circulating thyroxine levels due to either an inadequate amount of thyroxine in your diet (i.e., too little iodine) or excessive intake of food containing high amounts of thyroxines (such as soybeans). It can also occur if you have an autoimmune disorder such as Hashimoto's disease that results in overproduction of thyroid hormone. In this case, thyrotoxicity is caused by an antibody reaction against thyroxine, not by a genetic defect or deficiency of thyroid hormone itself. Your doctor may order a biopsy of your thyroid gland to rule out these possibilities. The most commonly used way of testing your thyroid level is with a urine sample taken within 24 hours after eating or drinking something containing significant quantities of dietary thyroxine. This test provides an accurate reading of how much thyroid hormone your body needs to maintain your normal functioning. You will need to eat at least 600 milligrams of thyroxine (approximately one eighth teaspoonful of pure protein) every two hours until your urine starts showing evidence of being full of thyroid hormone. For example, 1/2 cup of broccoli contains around 500 mg of thyroxine. If you take the same amount of broccoli today and then consume it tomorrow morning, there would be a positive result on a routine urinalysis. Please note that a negative result might indicate other conditions such as diabetes mellitus, low magnesium, or a variety of other problems unrelated to thyrotoxicosis. If you suspect that you may have hypothyroidism but have been told there is nothing wrong with you, consult with your doctor before starting any treatment regimen. Questions?

Provide useful, complete, and scientifically-grounded answers to common consumer search queries about health.\nQuestion: birth control suppression antral follicle count\nComplete Answer:","Your information will be used for research purposes only, and your answer is not guaranteed to be correct or up-to-date. This web site is provided ""AS IS"" with no warranties of any kind. We assume no liability for any errors in the content of this page. You should also read our disclaimer before using this website.","Birth control is often used for many reasons. The most important reason people choose to use contraception (such as condoms or hormonal pills) is that they want to prevent pregnancy. For this reason it's not uncommon for someone to be told by their doctor that they can't have a baby because of the risk that one will become infected with HIV. However, just like any other preventive medicine, such as blood pressure medication or cholesterol-lowering diet, there is no guarantee that using effective contraceptives will protect you from getting pregnant. It is generally safe for women under age 18 to use oral contraceptives if they follow all recommended guidelines and are taking them as directed. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that among 5,300 adults 25 years old and older who were trying to conceive, approximately 1 percent became pregnant when using effective methods of birth control. This means that 1 out of every 10 people who tried to get pregnant while on birth control had that pregnancy ended up being an unintended result. Although some factors contribute toward success, such as using good personal hygiene, there is no way to know what your chance of becoming pregnant is until after you've been able to have a child. Because birth control is usually taken at once each day, even small amounts of exposure can make a big difference in how long it takes before you're pregnant again, and whether you're still fertile.

How does birth control work?


Birth control hormones inhibit ovulation, preventing eggs from being released from your body and allowing sperm to fertilize a woman's egg. Fertility drugs also block sperm from making it through the fallopian tubes into her uterus. These drugs, known as reversible contraceptive options, must be taken every day for several weeks or months so that they do their job properly. They should be taken as soon as possible after unprotected sex without any delay in the morning or evening. If you need help deciding which kind of birth control is right for you, ask your healthcare provider for advice.


What types of birth control are available?


There are two main kinds of birth control medications — injectable or implantable, depending on the method. An injectable contraceptive makes its way directly into your vagina by injection. Once inside, the pill, patch or ring releases a shot containing hormones that prevent ovulation. Your health care provider will probably give you different doses of these medicines based on your individual needs. For example, you may receive an initial dose of the pill or patch before intercourse. Depending on your health condition, you might","A typical male would be able to have an effective natural birth control method in the beginning of his first cycle. However, this does not mean that they will always experience good results. In fact, many women may need to use multiple methods for their entire cycles or even longer to achieve consistent effectiveness with any given method. As long as you make sure your body is receiving adequate amounts of hormones, which include the hormone progestin, it can take some time before all effects from any method of contraception become apparent. It is important that women who use hormonal contraceptives know when they reach their monthly peak periods so that they are ready if necessary during their next period. If you do notice that you are more likely to go through the phase where you don't ovulate (and therefore no sperm is produced), consider using a different method of contraception such as the Pill, patch, or ring. Questions \nQuestion: I am taking hormone replacement therapy for breast cancer. How long should my meds last? Complete Answer: There are a number of factors involved with hormone replacement therapy, including how well the medication is working for you, the length of time since your last dose, and whether you have had previous heart surgery, diabetes, high blood pressure, cysts on the uterus, fibroids, thyroid problems, etc. Generally speaking, your most effective treatments should generally last at least 3 months after stopping them. You might want to try the pill for the first 2 weeks of treatment. After that, you'll probably need to start looking for a new form of protection. While it is true that taking less than 1 mg of estrogen per day can cause hair loss, there isn't enough evidence to recommend taking less than 5 mcg of estradiol/day. Your doctor will also want to talk with you about other medications you may be taking. The best thing to do is find out what your body needs for proper function. Once you've made up your mind, you can adjust your dosage accordingly based on your condition. Remember, once your meds are off the market, you won't be able to buy them again unless you have a prescription for the brand name medication. Some people feel it's much better to get a free sample than pay the extra money for brand name pills. When choosing a brand name option, always consult with your doctor beforehand. Most doctors will tell you to look into a generic version rather than a higher cost generics product because there is little difference between them. But the truth is, there really aren't any differences between the two","The effectiveness of hormonal contraception is highly variable between patients (approximately 20% efficacy). It should be noted that some individuals may experience increased risk for venous thromboembolism with use of the pill compared to other forms of contraceptive medication or hormone replacement therapy. This risk varies depending on individual characteristics, including age, race/ethnicity, and parity (i.e., whether the woman has had children). Although it can reduce the risk of blood clots in women who are at high risk (i.e., those with pre-existing cardiac disease), the benefits from using hormonal contraceptives have not been well studied for this population. Furthermore, the relative risks of venous thrombosis in men who use hormonal methods, such as intrauterine devices (IUDs) and diaphragms, and female partners of male users were greater than among the general population. Therefore, information provided by women regarding adverse events following use of hormonal contraceptives is important because there is no safe level of exposure to these products. Based on the available research, no adverse effects have been demonstrated associated with long-term use of hormonal contraceptives; however, it is important to inform women about the risks associated with prolonged use and the potential benefits of stopping.

""As an aid to finding the most relevant information regarding medications, I am posting here a few key points that you might find interesting,"" Dr. Brown said. ""If you would like more detailed information on each of the medications listed, please visit www.medscape.com/topic/treatment-for-rhythmias.""","You can use both of these methods in your search for the answer but I recommend using one method first as it is much more likely that you will find a specific answer to what you want rather than having to go through all the web sites looking for different versions of the same questions. If you are looking for an average number of follicles or numbers of follicles per cycle then this would be very difficult as they may vary slightly from person to person so it takes some time to actually determine which method is best for you! The next question ""What is the total number of ovaries in my body?"", is very important as many people do not know the approximate amount of hormones produced by their ovaries throughout their lifetime. Your total hormone production during your menstrual cycles is dependent upon the size of your ovarian follicles. This is something that most women tend to forget due to the vast array of information available online. In order to calculate your follicle count you need to find out your age, height, weight, age at menopause (when ovulation occurs), if you have any fertility problems such as low sperm counts or low testosterone levels etc... The last piece of advice on searching for answers to questions related to fertility is that it is often hard to make sense of all of the conflicting and confusing scientific research that exists on the subject. Some people just don't understand why certain products do what they do but others think that every product sold in the market has been tested thoroughly enough to be safe and effective. Sometimes you just need to try them yourself. All I can say is take the time to really read the labels of all the products on offer and ask yourself if each product you buy would be a good option for you. It's true that we are constantly bombarded with information about how our bodies work and what makes us healthy. Our bodies work in ways that are not always apparent to us until it's too late. With all of the misinformation and lack of clarity surrounding human reproduction and reproduction technology there is no doubt that we need to learn more about ourselves and our reproductive systems so that we can make informed decisions. This is why I encourage everyone who reads my blog to start with a simple Google search on female fertility and male fertility. Many of the websites listed below contain very detailed articles on these topics. There is also plenty of excellent literature and information published over the internet.

Searching for Fertility Related Questions","A. The number of follicles that produce an egg is called the follicular unit size (FUS). The FUS may be from as low as 1/10 to as high as 10/20 in volume. B. During ovulation the body produces more androgen hormones than it can use, or any amount of estrogen. In the presence of these excess hormones, the ovary cannot release enough eggs for fertilization. Therefore, each time an egg comes out of the ovary there will be a negative feedback loop where the hormone production goes down while the follicle counts go up. This process has been known since ancient times. However, because of the lack of accurate information available, many women have mistakenly believed that they do not need treatment for this condition. This misinformation often occurs because some physicians think that the ""normal"" level of fertility is 25 to 30 percent when in fact it can range anywhere between 20 to 50 percent if the patient does not take any other medications such as medication for diabetes or hypertension. It would help if all women understood how important it is for them to know their fertility status. In addition, it would be beneficial if providers could provide patients with an accurate chart showing the follicular units produced during various phases of their menstrual cycles, including peak folliculogenesis (the second part of ovulation), and regular menstrual cycle fluctuations. These charts should also include a monthly average value so that the patient can determine whether his or her fertility levels are normal or abnormal. Answer: C. Yes. If a woman is diagnosed with OCS she has the option to undergo hysterectomy or anovulatory surgery. Some doctors believe that the majority of patients who have a problem with oocyte maturation at the end of their second cycle actually have no problems at all with the first cycle. Therefore, they recommend that a woman who is ovulating on the last day of her first cycle start taking oral contraceptives and then begin using oral contraceptives again after three weeks until her next period. For a woman whose ovaries are very sensitive, this plan might result in a total hysterectomy. Other doctors prefer to wait a few months to see how much the ovarian follicles enlarge. Once the enlarged follicles have reached 2 mm in diameter, a second round of oral contraceptive use might be advised.

In this case, there may be a slight chance that an implantation will occur before or after intercourse. If so, it is likely that the fertilized egg would not be implanted in the uterus. A study published in 1988 examined 28 postmenopausal women who had recently given birth and found that one woman's implantation occurred after intercourse. Another woman's implantation was delayed by more than three days.2) The best contraceptive method for preventing pregnancy depends on how soon the woman decides to stop having sex.

The most commonly used method of contraception is chemical or surgical sterilization. Sterilization reduces sexual pleasure and can cause permanent infertility. Because hormonal contraceptives suppress the ovaries in women, they provide only partial protection against pregnancy, so some women may experience an adverse effect on their fertility if they use them for too long. This is not true with hormonal contraceptive methods; they generally protect against conception without causing an estrogenic reaction. \nQuestion: what does \""anti-androgens\"" mean? Complete Answer: Anti-androgens are substances that reduce or prevent production of certain types of hormone, including the growth and release of gonads, prostate glands, and other reproductive organs. Anti-androgens are also called sex steroids, and anti-estrogens are referred to by this term because they inhibit the formation of estrogens. In fact, some anti-androgens have been found to be more effective at reducing the effects of female hormones than estrogen replacement therapy. For example, some anti-androgens like norgestimate are thought to be more effective at preventing the onset of menses than oral contraceptives. Some anti-androgens are considered safe even when taken repeatedly over time. In addition, many of the chemicals that contain these compounds, such as acrylamide and ethinyl estradiol, are excreted in urine. \nQuestion: how do I know if I am taking an injectable drug or an implant? Complete Answer: When you read this question, you must be asking yourself: ""What's this all about?"" A number of questions asked during a routine visit will reveal whether you are receiving medication or an implant. These include: \nquestion: Are my symptoms coming back?

For example, your eyes are not centered when looking through your eyeglass frames, so they don't fit correctly. You can tell if your eyeglasses are warped by measuring the distance between where their lenses meet.\nQuestion: how long does it take for my blood pressure to go down after wearing glasses?\nAnswer: This depends upon the person's age, body mass index (BMI) and other factors. For most people, taking regular medication such as aspirin or ibuprofen may help lower blood pressure. However, some individuals may need a more complicated approach than aspirin or ibuprofen alone. In addition, blood pressure medications can cause side effects that are often unpleasant or even dangerous. Some of these include heartburn, nausea, blurred vision, headache, dizziness and feeling faint. Taking any type of prescription drug could also affect your ability to drive safely and make it harder for you to work. If you have difficulty controlling your blood pressure, then your doctor would probably recommend an exercise program or lowering your dose of medication.

QUESTION: what type of glasses do I need for my job?\n\n Answer: There is no exact answer to this question. As with most things related to vision, there are pros and cons. Professional lenses from reputable manufacturers like Raymarine, Zeiss, and Bausch & Lomb, provide good quality optics that won't fog up during everyday wear and tear. For more information, visit www.visionexpert.com (http://www.visionexpert.com/)

QUESTION: what should I know about glasses before I go into the hospital? \n\nAnswer: The following information is from the American Society of Anesthesiologists: ""The most important thing is that you have read and understood the following statements. They contain legal advice intended only for physicians licensed in your state and must be followed by all anesthetists and optometrists."" Read the statement carefully before you come to see the optometrist or an anesthesiologist.

""In some cases, patients who have had vision problems due to diabetes or cataracts will require special glasses because of their age and visual acuity. However, when evaluating these patients, it is essential that they understand the risks involved before obtaining glasses. With proper guidance and management, vision is likely to improve over time, although improvement can occur gradually even if the patient continues to receive treatment.""

Can I get a prescription?

Yes, prescriptions for over-the-counter medications are available in many pharmacies. In addition, many specialty drug stores sell prescription drugs and other supplies. If you go to one of these places, ask the pharmacist about obtaining a prescription from the FDA. Most pharmacies will charge a nominal fee--usually $3-$4 per month--for making the prescription. But if you prefer to do this yourself, there is an easy way to do so without going through the hassle of getting a prescription in the first place.\r

If you go to a pharmacy with prescription pads, you'll find that most have written instructions on how to write prescriptions, including identifying each ingredient. You won't need anything special for this, but some companies have extra pens or cartridges that you might want. See: Prescription Pens.


In addition to a set number of prescription pills, many pharmacies carry all kinds of vitamins and nutritional supplements. These are often sold in sets of two. They generally contain little more than salt, sugar, or caffeine. You don't need any additional supplies besides those listed above. However, some companies offer extras such as vitamins and minerals or dietary supplements. To check out which are around here, start by looking in your local grocery store's health department section. They typically sell the same stuff as your local pharmacy. \r

If you have any questions concerning prescription eyeglasses please contact the author directly at: [email protected]","There are many companies that make prescription glasses available online and in retail stores as well as through specialty eyeglass retailers such as B&H, Walgreen's, Target, etc. The main issues with using prescription sunglasses is that you should check the prescription carefully to determine if they have any limitations or whether it is necessary to wear them all day long. If you buy from an authorized retailer, they will usually have a list of acceptable lenses on their website. Ask the person how much money is involved in getting a pair of glasses, how often they recommend purchasing a particular model, etc.\n\nQuestion: I am pregnant. How do I find out which size my baby is? Complete Answer: Some providers suggest taking your child's weight in ounces when looking at their birth certificate to get an accurate estimate of what size they might be. However, not every provider recommends this practice. It can cause some confusion among parents who want to know where their babies fit into the gender spectrum. You may need to ask your pediatrician before ordering birth-certificate sized glasses, however, as many healthcare professionals do not use birth certificates to calculate baby sizes.

In addition, a number of websites sell prescription sunglasses, even though many of these products contain chemicals known to harm vision. For instance, Acorn Vision sells ""Clear"" prescription shades sold under its own brand name. These products contain chemicals called UV filters that block harmful ultraviolet rays produced by sunlight. They also contain substances known to damage retinal cells, leading to decreased color sensitivity in people with certain types of eye diseases. This means that prescription sunglasses made from these materials could potentially affect sight, especially those whose eyesight has been affected by retinitis pigmentosa (RP). In addition, some of the glasses marketed as clear may not offer the protection required of prescription glasses. \nIf your doctor tells you to take medications during pregnancy, she may prescribe prescription sunglasses to protect your eyes. A few brands, such as Oakley, claim to provide up to 70% protection against damaging UVA/UVB radiation, but studies conducted on people who wore these glasses showed no significant benefit over standard safety glasses.

As with other types of eyewear, prescription sunglasses cannot prevent the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which occurs when light damage to cones (the lens') is so severe as to inhibit normal growth of new photoreceptor cells. \nThis process, called cataracts, results in blurry vision resulting in poor reading, night blindness,"

Question: What is the difference between an acupressure technique for neck pain and a massage technique?\nAnswer: Acupuncture and massages have some similarities in that they both use pressure to stimulate specific areas of the body, but there are significant differences as well. In addition to being able to treat specific injuries or problems, acupuncture can also help relieve muscle tension and reduce aches. Massage has more similarities in terms of its effects on the rest of the body, and it's often used to treat other conditions like back pain.

Question: How do I know which type of massage should be best for my patients?\nAnswer: Many of the basic factors, such as location, intensity, duration, amount of stimulation, and frequency, affect how effective the massage will be and what types of muscles you'll get stimulated. Here are some recommendations based upon your experience with massage therapy. For example, if you've been doing yoga and a particular spot on your upper arm feels tender, try using a gentle downward motion while holding onto something near your elbow. If you have a big bruise under one shoulder, you might prefer to use a light massage; however, when using a lot of pressure to apply pressure on one particular area, this may cause discomfort to other parts of your body.

Question: What is the average cost of massage in my city?\nAnswer: There really isn't any data to provide insight into the price of massage services, so we're assuming a general ballpark figure here. The total cost for a typical session ranges from $30-$60 per hour, depending upon the strength and length of the treatment. You could also expect to spend up to 25% of your total budget on supplies (clothing and toys), although these items should not increase your overall cost.


The good news is that it would take a large number of sessions to equal out the cost of a standard home visit. So even though many people feel pressured into paying exorbitant fees for massages, it's important to note that the real savings won't come until after you've spent time at the spa treating yourself!","Neck and shoulders stretch is one of the most common conditions that people have when they are pregnant or trying to conceive. It can also be an indication of heart problems in women of childbearing age as it helps keep blood flow to the baby's head. In addition, these muscles help hold back the uterus and cervix so that the placenta (placental lining) does not leak out during pregnancy.\n

If you're having trouble understanding what this word means, here is an example sentence from my blog post on ""How to Tell If Your Baby Is Ready""

When babies first develop, their upper limbs don't always grow properly. When they reach 2 years old, they usually need some extra support for growth. Try some simple neck and shoulder stretches. These can help keep your baby's arms, legs, neck, chest, and lower back healthy and strong. \nQuestion: How do I know if my son has a birth defect? Complete Answer: First and foremost, check his head size. A larger head means more weight at the end of his body. Also, if he has a cleft palate, there will likely be fewer teeth than normal because his mouth can move around the way that a kid with no clefts has. Some things are more obvious than others; that's why we ask questions like, ""Do you find that your belly button makes it harder for him to get out?"" If he doesn't seem confused by this question, then he probably hasn't yet been born. And he may have just had surgery which might make him look different in the future. So, if you see any of those signs, start looking up information about birth defects. But before you go searching for information online, you should also consult with your doctor or midwife about your son's birth risk factors. Your midwife can tell you how many children you'll have, how much time your child will spend breastfeeding, and whether he needs special care for certain types of birth injuries or infections, such as urinary tract infection (UTI), preeclampsia, low birthweight, and premature rupture of membranes (PPO). She can also give advice about birth positions and how often you'll be able to visit her office and how she might feel comfortable helping you with childbirth.

\nQuestion: What is the best way for me to get rid of my white streaks?\nComplete Answer: White Bloating - Why Does It Happen When I Have White Slips? There are lots of reasons why someone may develop white streaks on their legs or arms after a long night out. Here's what you need to know: 1. The white spots usually occur when your body has been exposed to certain medications (such as pain medication, antibiotics, diuretics) 2. These medications can cause blood vessels in your skin and around them to become inflamed 3. Once an area has started getting inflamed, it will stay that way until something changes, such as taking anti-inflammatory drugs 4. Sometimes these blobs can be hard to remove because they are so large 5. Once removed, most of the whites may stick to the skin and cause more problems 6. In addition to being painful, these white areas can also create a lot of redness and irritation, which can make people feel very uncomfortable 7. If left untreated, white blotting marks can eventually lead to serious infections like gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, herpes, mumps, and other sexually transmitted diseases 8. Another reason some people experience these blots on their legs and arms is from sweating from the inside 9. In most cases, there isn't much you can do to prevent these blots, but there are a few things you can try 10. Try using a moisturizing cream or lotion with water or a good exfoliant before bed 11. Wear loose clothing at night 12. Don't forget to brush your teeth regularly 13. Sleep in soft sheets 14. Keep your hair short 15. Use sunblock, if you use any 16. Stop smoking 17. Reduce alcohol intake 18. Eat fruits and vegetables 19. Exercise 20. Take vitamin D supplements 21. Drink plenty of fluids 22. Avoid caffeine 23. Cut down on sugar 24. Limit salt 25.

You can use one hand or both hands for this kind of stretching. One thing to watch out for though is that you may have a tight neck, which will make it harder for you to stretch. Also, there is no harm in doing any sort of stretch if your neck muscles are strong enough.


Sitting on a chair with legs spread apart is also an excellent way to stretch your neck muscles, especially as they increase during pregnancy.


How to Stretch Your Neck and Shoulders


Step 1: Sit in a comfortable position.


If you need to take your arms off the desk when you're working from home, stand with your back against something solid like a wall or a table, such as a chair or a couch. If you need to get up from a seated position, place some of your weight back on the chair or couch and sit up straight until your body feels relaxed again. When you first sit in your office chair, keep it elevated.


This stretches your upper arm bones, which tend to be shorter than those of other people's arms, and makes it easier to push through tension in your lower spine.


Step 2: Place the tip of your index finger lightly touching the inside of your wrist. The palm side of your hand should not touch the outside of your forearm bone. Hold this position for 30 seconds or longer without moving your fingers.


To lengthen or shorten your neck muscles, try placing the tips of your thumb and pinky together at the top of your neck, just below your earlobe. Try not to move the fingers. This moves the muscle of your cervical vertebrae away from each other and helps prevent neck problems later in life.


Step 3: Slowly stretch forward.


When you've reached the point where your head isn't completely turned toward the ceiling, slowly raise your left elbow slightly until it touches the floor or the bottom edge of the bed. Slowly bring your right knee forward a few inches, then let go. Do it three times. For full range of motion, try raising your right leg up by bending forward instead of using the thigh muscles to push yourself forward.


Be sure to rest the right foot on the floor before starting a downward movement.

Use the following exercises only once per week for at least 3 weeks. They should be performed before any other stretching activities. To help you remember these stretches, perform each exercise as if it were your first day of school and with all hands on shoulders (arms outstretched). For example:

Lie face down in a supine position and lie with your head facing up so that your shoulders rest comfortably over the tops of your legs. Your wrists, elbows, and knees should remain straight throughout this stretch. Try not to lift your hips off the ground during this movement. You can also use a neutral grip while doing the above stretches.

Hold for 10 to 20 seconds and exhale, then repeat 5 more times until fatigued or the pain is gone.

Note: The muscles in the neck and shoulder area have to be stretched because they hold the back of our heads from falling forward when we sit or stand. This leads to poor posture and neck injuries. Do not attempt to get yourself into good posture by bending the arms and putting them behind your back. Instead try to keep your torso upright and extend both sides of your body.","This is an extremely important question that could have serious consequences for your life or the lives of other people. The short answer is that there is no scientific evidence whatsoever suggesting any particular kind of stretch should be done by anyone in order to reduce your risk of cancer or heart disease. There is certainly some research into stretching muscles, but it doesn't seem all that strong. I'm not going to give you the science behind what works and what doesn't, because most of it is quite well known already (see above). But here are my own personal experience with stretching, and how much I believe that it does or does not help.

First off, let's start with what makes stretching different from anything else you can do to increase your flexibility. When your body stretches, each muscle group performs slightly differently as they adapt to the new tension. This means that if someone were to go through a typical stretching routine, their muscles would probably be able to take on a lot more stress than usual and still maintain that flexibility. To put things another way, a person who does a traditional stretch every day will likely be at full strength within a week of doing this. This is something that you don't want when you're trying to get lean and keep your joints healthy, so you need to know exactly which muscles you are supposed to stretch before beginning a set of exercises.

For example, let's say that we are going to stretch our shoulders. First thing you'll notice is that your shoulders will feel a little tight and that it might hurt a bit to do a regular stretch. However, since the muscles are adapting to the new tension and you aren't trying to ""tear them apart,"" they won't actually become sore and uncomfortable immediately after doing these exercises. In fact, if you follow the basic plan suggested below, you'd probably end up feeling even stronger and more flexible than if you hadn't stretched your shoulders at all! And remember, when it comes to stretching, you really shouldn't try to change your body type or size just to improve your flexibility. You should always think about getting fit and active instead. A lot of people like to try to do lots of exercise and burn fat while being flexible, yet when you compare how strong they feel compared to someone without a ton of fitness background, you realize that this isn't usually worth the extra effort. So when you're ready to make a commitment to learn proper stretching technique, read on…

The Basics of Proper Stretching Technique

Before we move on to"
131,"You are a helpful medical knowledge assistant. Provide useful, complete, and scientifically-grounded answers to common consumer search queries about health.\nQuestion: exercises for better posture\nComplete Answer:","You may not have the time or inclination to go through the research yourself, so we recommend you take a look at our resources on this topic. \nQuestion: which foods to eat for weight loss? Complete Answer: The most important factor to consider when looking for food sources of calories is how much you burn from them. While it would be fine if your daily intake were strictly controlled (e.g., you ate one large serving of vegetables every day), there's no reason why it shouldn't be possible to add some additional calories to your diet by consuming other things that provide a similar effect. For example, eating more protein can increase your burning rate significantly, but it will also boost the level of carbohydrates in your diet. \nQuestion: what's the best way to get back an extra 40 lbs.? Complete Answer: Most people simply need to start working out again (or stop) after having lost the amount they used to gain. If you're already healthy and able to train hard enough, then it doesn't really matter whether or not you lose weight as long as you've got enough energy left over to make sure you stay strong and fit. After all, it takes quite a bit of effort just to maintain the body you started with...and then some! \nQuestion: How do I stay fit while being active? Complete Answer: Once your diet becomes more balanced and healthy, you should be able to perform at least some moderate physical activity regularly (i.e., walking to work). As such, keep a running journal where you record the number of miles you run each week, and also record the times you exercise (on foot, bike, etc.). This information can help guide you toward an optimal approach to fitness and health. Your goal should still be to remain physically active at all times; however, it does help to determine the appropriate percentage of your total energy expenditure for both aerobic and resistance training activities. \nQuestion: how far can I go without taking any breaks? Complete Answer: It's easy to feel like you're always getting distracted or stuck doing something else. That's because many of us live in a constant state of motion; constantly moving between activities, routines, and priorities. However, this isn't necessarily harmful, since you can learn to manage your schedule and focus on only certain types of tasks. There are various ways to improve efficiency. Exercise often, particularly on a regular basis, can help you become aware of when you're spending too much time sitting and therefore making your efforts less efficient.

putting on weight machines (to improve flexibility) Question: What is an exercise program?\nAnswer: The type of exercise you do depends on how active you want to be. For example, if you do yoga, walking, or tennis exercises to burn calories and get more oxygen in your blood, then you should try a strength routine that will help with those activities. However, if you like to go running or rollerblading to build muscle mass or have a general interest in fitness, then it's fine to do some strength training as well. Exercise programs can include basic movement drills, such as push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups, and so forth. Or they might include more advanced exercises that require additional strength. \nAs for where to start, choose one workout program at a time that works best for you. After choosing your program, you may need to modify it slightly depending on how much activity you'll be doing during your training period. Most people find that their first few days on a new program don't feel too bad; but after a couple of weeks, you can expect pain in certain joints, especially knees and ankles. If this happens, you may need to take a few months off of strength training before getting back into it. Finally, most people who gain a lot of muscle mass tend not to notice any improvement after a year or two. It is important for you to continue strong workouts throughout your life and to adjust your training schedule accordingly. This way, you won't get hurt and you'll retain all the benefits from regular strength training. The only exception to this is if you're underweight or overweight—in which case you should follow an appropriate diet (the same guidelines apply).",http://www.americanacademyofmedicine.org/publications_library/questions/health_and_biosafety_questions.asp?id=1216,"http://www.healthcenter.com/get-the-hc...-exercises/ Question: how to use the toilet before bed?\nAnswer: by using a stool to push down on the bottom of your bowel and then sitting up or lying down. This will help you to maintain your posture and allow you to be able to defecate without discomfort. In addition, this is recommended as it helps relieve constipation. You can also use a large spoon to help with any additional difficulty in passing stools. Another option would be to have someone else hold your hand while you pass stools. The only real issue to remember is that there may be some residual pain caused by the pressure from the stools. If it does occur, simply move into another position until you no longer experience such pain. A few extra minutes in bed could help prevent these problems. \nQuestion: what is the best way to clean my hands after eating?\nAnswer: Place one hand over one's mouth and gently suck the food out. It should not feel too rough. Then place the other hand under the tongue and repeat the process. Be sure to keep your fingers well away from your teeth. In most cases, if you have trouble digesting food because of the raw smell, then try to let it settle back into your stomach. If that doesn't work, then just give yourself an hour and eat something again. Finally, you can either swallow it whole or chew or spit it out. Sometimes the problem is due to bacteria being released during chewing. Most times when this occurs, it should take several days before you can stop the activity once the bacteria has settled. However, when the initial irritation has passed, you may feel much better within two weeks of getting rid of the bug. \nQuestion: How do I know which medications are safe for me? Are they all alike? Answer: The safest medication choice for anyone taking a daily medication is a nonprescription drug containing at least 30 micrograms of magnesium per pill (about five teaspoons). Since magnesium plays a role in energy levels, it's important that people who need to take an antidepressant dose be sure that their medication contains enough of the mineral. Many antidepressants contain only small amounts of magnesium as part of a complex combination of ingredients. Because of this, many people find it difficult to know whether their prescribed medications are high enough in magnesium to compensate for any potential negative side effects of the medications. Therefore, it's vital to consult your doctor prior to making any decisions","http://www.healthydna.com/discover/article/160920?_type=main&publisherId=54785&refID=62250%2C0b7c1

It's best if you hold it in place while lying flat or on a pillow. This will help prevent the muscles from being strained by the stress of sitting down. You can bend your knees higher than they should be but this doesn't work as well because the extra pressure on the lower spine causes strain in your cervical vertebrae.

2) The Wall Rope Lie is an advanced variation on the Wall Lie. If you have trouble keeping your legs straight during the Wall Lie, try using a rope instead. Hold onto the end of the rope and lean forward. Keep a neutral spine position throughout while holding the weight of your body against the ceiling above your head. To increase flexibility, use a barbell or dumbbell between your thighs and push against the wall with both arms to activate your core. To keep things light, avoid using any heavy weights. A couple of additional benefits of the Wall Lie include: Increased mobility due to the vertical nature of the lie; Decreased risk of overuse injuries as you become more proficient in the Wall Lie.


3) Wall Sits, also called Wall Hugs, is an alternative movement to Wall Lying that can improve your range of motion and decrease muscle tension. Use one leg to sit up and bring the other into a squatting position. Your bodyweight can be supported by supporting yourself with a support hand or a sturdy object such as a chair or stool. Once seated, slowly raise and lower your torso until your butt touches the floor. Slowly return to standing position and repeat for the recommended number of repetitions.

4) Wall Spinning is similar to Wall Sitting, but instead of resting your head off the floor, spin around, rotating your entire body around the ground. When performing Wall Spinning, focus on keeping your head above the surface of the earth rather than using gravity to keep you upright. Continue spinning for 20 seconds before stopping. Repeat again for desired amount of time.

5) One-Arm Dumbbell Curls works very similarly to Wall Curling, except that instead of supporting your whole body with a pair of hands, you use just one arm to support your weight. Perform 30 repetitions for each arm and then switch arms for the next set. Try this move for 4 sets of 6 reps.","http://www.healthypeople.com/diseases/posterior-grip-exercises.aspx Question: How does my neck or shoulders affect my reading?

Complete Answer: First consult your physician before taking any medication. If it has been more than 24 hours since you took this medication, contact your physician immediately. In addition, ask your healthcare provider whether you need to avoid strenuous activities on the day following the exposure.

In addition, the skin may be excessively oily because there is excessive sebum produced. Many symptoms can be alleviated or prevented by proper diet and lifestyle changes such as eating less oil and more fresh fruit and vegetables. This article will focus on what you need to know about this condition and how you can improve your chances of being cured or at least significantly improved. \nSymptoms of psoriatic arthritis:\n1) Headaches\n2) Numbness and tingling in arms and legs\n3) Pain and stiffness in joints, especially those that have been injured\n4) Fatigue or lack of energy\n5) Loss of appetite, weight loss, headaches, joint pain\n6) Cravings for foods that cause severe food intolerance \nWhat causes psoriasis?\nA psoriasis occurs when an immune system attack on the follicle (the tiny chamber inside each cell), resulting in inflammation of the follicles. The inflammatory cells then become trapped within the follicle which produces large amounts of sebum and other oils known as sebum barrier proteins. These toxins attach themselves to the cell membranes causing swelling of the follicular wall, the cell layer that covers most of the body from the bottom to top. Symptoms include frequent itching and redness of the face, neck, and hands (usually in the upper arm). The irritation caused by the toxic protein build up and subsequent inflammation can also lead to rashes, burning sensations, sores, and inflamed lymph nodes. Although psoriasis is not a contagious disease it does spread quickly through close contact. When psoriasis first appears it usually only affects one person in the family. Once the illness progresses, however, it becomes more common and even widespread across generations. As psoriasis progresses it develops into two distinct disorders; erythema multiforme (EM) and erythematosarcoma (EOS). EM is a chronic disease characterized by persistent, non-specific dermatitis and inflammation of the epidermis and dermis, often involving the palms, soles, buttocks, and underarms (also called ""underarm psoriasis""). EOS is more limited in its manifestation, affecting a small number of people (typically fewer than 10%) with a rash spreading down the back and trunk. Both types of psoriasis, however, share many underlying medical conditions and treatments.","yes or no\nQuestion: how long does it take for hair from one year old to grow back?\nAnswer:\ nIf you live in the US,\nyou must have answered this question by now because it is an important part of your family history.\nIt is called \ngenetic\nanormal\nparental\nadipose\nenvironmental factors that may influence the growth rate of hair\nand some even cause a person to lose their hair.\nIn addition to genetic and environmental influences, there are individual variations.\nFor example,\nthere was a time when people with short hair would shave only once a week. Now, they keep shaving every other day!\nHair loss is a natural process and can be controlled through proper nutrition, exercise, medications, and personal lifestyle choices.\nThe most effective treatment for any type of hair loss is a hair regrowth therapy\nthat helps restore healthy hair follicles.\nThis requires daily injections of hormones into the skin. The result is\nregenerative stimulation of the follicle, which allows it to grow again. If you did not know about your genetics, you would not be able to stop having hair,\nthe same way you cannot control your weight or height.\nTo avoid hair loss, you should always look for products containing a variety of healthy ingredients such as fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, etc. You can also change your diet so that you get more calcium, protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals. For those who do not want to stop being thin, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables will help to prevent hair loss.

RAW Paste Data

Basic Information About Hair Growth In order to understand the role of hair, it is necessary to first identify its structure.\nHair consists of keratin (a type of connective tissue), cells, and the proteins called\nepithelial growth factor (EGF).\nEpithelial growth factor plays a crucial role in keeping hair in place and protecting it against damage. Without it, hairs could become damaged. It can also stimulate hair growth through several different mechanisms.\nIn women, keratin contains cholesterol, fatty acids, and carbohydrates. This is why hair growth occurs when estrogen levels rise during pregnancy or when a woman has a period. When a man grows his hair, he produces epidermal growth factor (EGF) but does not produce much","Yes. It is the most prevalent skin disease in North America, affecting 1 in 30 Americans. The cause of this condition is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune reaction. \nQuestion: What are the symptoms and signs of allergic rhinitis? Complete Answer: Rhinitis usually starts with itching for 10 days or more. The itch may become worse if you're not wearing any protective clothing. Your doctor will have instructions on how to treat your symptoms. \nQuestion: What is cold sores? Complete Answer: Cold sores are sores that develop around your nose or mouth when you get something irritating on your body. They are caused by bacteria. Most people who have these infections don't know they have them, so they can be difficult to see and treat because the infection spreads quickly through the mucous membranes between your lips and your eyes. This makes cold sores look like pimples. \nQuestion: How do I make sure my kid's school won't bully me? Complete Answer: When your child has had a hard time at school, ask him what his teachers think of him. Tell your teacher about his trouble making friends and talking with other kids. You may want to ask if he wants extra help or has been kicked out of class. Ask him why. \nQuestion: Can I tell you anything about my cat? Complete Answer: Cats are carnivorous animals, meaning they eat both mammals and birds. They also carry parasites called fleas that eat the blood of their prey. So it's important to keep cats away from your pets as much as possible. \nQuestion: Is there such thing as an ""allergy"" to sugar? Complete Answer: There is no such thing as an allergy to sugar or any food containing sugars. It is just a symptom of eating too many calories. Try avoiding sugary foods until you find out which ones really irritate you. \nQuestion: What is the best way to keep children safe at home while they play outside? Complete Answer: Children should wear long pants or shoes at all times. Keep pets inside indoors only when necessary. If you are unsure about the safety of a particular activity, talk with your pediatrician or family physician before taking part. \nQuestion: What does ""good"" mean to you? Complete Answer: Good means healthy and full of energy. A good parent always keeps her baby healthy and well-fed. \nQuestion: Does water hurt my eyes? Complete Answer: It probably doesn't. But your eye care professional","There is no definitive answer to this question and the correct treatment for psoriasis is often individualized, but there are a number of factors that can be effective in decreasing your chances of getting psoriasis. In general, people with dry skin should avoid tanning beds. People who have been diagnosed as having psoriasis or other skin conditions can try using an anti-fungal medication such as minoxidil (Zyrtec) daily for 3-7 days before attempting to bathe or shower. The best time for bathing is when you are most tired and stressed out so you can help eliminate bacteria that cause disease.

The only correct choice is between options. What's important here is that you choose wisely based on your own personal preferences (as opposed to what someone else suggests). For example, if you don't want your face shaved, then use a beard, moustache, or beard brush instead, as explained later. If you don't have any preference at all, then simply do not shave. However, if you've been looking forward to having your face shaved and now find yourself wanting one, then try this simple trick to get it done without too much pain! Take some shaving cream, put a few drops under a small hole in your nose, and blow gently through the opening while pulling back, so that the cream flows out through the hole into the nostril (this will leave less residue when you clean up afterwards). This way the razor cuts right into your skin (without damaging sensitive areas like the eyelids), but still leaves enough of a cushioning effect for the razor to glide smoothly over your face. It may take time to figure out exactly which solution works best for you. You should also make sure that the area you're trying to cover is covered before starting your first shave. When you get home from school, go ahead and put on a pair of gloves so that you're comfortable working with shaving creams, so that you'll be able to apply them well even after the cut has healed. Once the foam block is fully saturated, remove the block from the sink, rinse thoroughly, and pat dry thoroughly using a towel. You may need to hold your hand over the foam so that it doesn't slip off during the cutting process. Do not attempt to perform this step if you suspect that you may have swallowed something. Your doctor might give you a prescription for an antiseptic gel, but that's really not necessary since you can easily get that stuff at most pharmacies and drugstores. Use a soft cloth to rub the foam block against your face until it becomes coated with a thin film of shaving foam. Then, slowly but surely, begin to massage the area with gentle, controlled pressure, using the foam to prevent lather from accumulating on top of the foam. Be careful not to rub the blade","\s0100319_00a6b1c3-f9e0-4715-8fb5-2d7ad12ddd4e\nTo help you identify the symptoms of hair loss, this section explains what you need to do to correct these problems. When hair is lost, it can appear on the back or sides of the head (hairline), in your forehead, eyebrows, temples, neck, and on top of your ears (hairline). Hair loss also occurs under your arms and around the chest and face (hairspray line). In general, people who have moderate or severe hair loss usually lose some of their hair to one side; people with moderate or severe hair loss may lose all of it. If you think that someone has been experiencing hair loss, go to your doctor or an emergency room immediately. The person might have experienced other types of skin cancer. However, if hair loss does not cause pain, it probably does not require treatment. It's important to recognize that people may get different results when they use hairsprays. For example, some people report that their hair grows back during the first two weeks, while others experience hair growth every month thereafter. Because many factors affect how quickly hair appears, it's best for men to start using hair removal products at age 40. For women, it's better for them to begin using hair removal products after age 35. Men should consider starting at age 30.

Head pats are one of the most effective treatments for psoriatic dermatitis. The skin that is afflicted with the disease produces a thin, oily outer layer that can be rubbed or scraped off in order to relieve itching. A small number of people do not respond well to this treatment; however, it has been shown to prevent or alleviate many other types of chronic diseases as well.\n\n

Head pats may also be used to treat various other conditions such as eczema and psoriasis, lupus erythematosus, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), osteoarthritis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), asthma, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome/chronic constipation, and more. These problems can often be treated by using other methods of hair removal including scalp flaps, bandanas, and a variety of products such as shampoo, conditioner, gel, and waxes. Although a lot of research has gone into the efficacy of these techniques, there aren't any studies specifically on treating head lice. If you have questions regarding how to use these products, please see our FAQ page. \n\n

What does the term ""head lice"" mean?


The term ""head louse"" refers to an adult animal bite from a biting insect known as the European corn beetle, Neisseria meningitidis (European white bee). It was originally classified as a parasitic infestation because it could cause death when its eggs were ingested. However, over time, scientists determined that the larvae of the insect were actually developing within the host. Scientists believe that the larvae develop from the egg shells of a few species of bees throughout the world. There are two main subspecies in North America: European corn borer (Cynomastix europeanum) and Mexican corn borer (M. nigripes). While both of these pests live in warm temperate regions where they prefer to lay their eggs. They feed primarily on corn, soybean, peanuts, tree nuts, and fruit, but will attack almost anything else that fits their diet. During their larval stage, the adults form protective cocoons under leaves, twigs, and debris. In addition to attacking and killing the larvae, the adults also eat any nits or insects that come in contact with them while feeding. Because of their predatory nature, no type of protection is needed against these aggressive pests","\N/A\nQuestion: can I get ear pain from the flu?\nAnswer: yes.\nQuestion: which is better for me: lollipop or smart phone?

Question: what is the difference between lauric acid and lauramides?\nAnswer: lauric acid is an alcohol that occurs naturally in many foods but does not occur in products made from it such as cosmetics. Lauramides (cis-laurate) is also a chemical compound found in most plant foods, including some animal products, which may be used for the production of food ingredients or industrial solvents. The FDA has approved use of these two forms of lauric acid in various cosmetic formulations but no commercial product is available to date.
