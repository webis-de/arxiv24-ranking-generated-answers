1,Q: What are the most common chronic diseases? What effects do chronic diseases have for the society and the individual?\nA:,"Chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease and stroke affect millions of people in India. They are major causes of disability and death among persons over 65 years of age. The burden from these diseases is severe and increasing rapidly due to health-care costs and other social and economic costs. In contrast, acute diseases like infectious and parasitic diseases are treated by specialists who often treat a limited number of patients at one time. These disorders pose more immediate risks to individuals but also may be preventable through good prevention practices that include active hygiene, nutrition and exercise. For instance, people living in areas with high pollution should reduce exposure to indoor air pollutants, use air purifiers or filters when cooking, eating, and bathing, and limit the amount of alcohol they consume. The WHO has estimated that an additional 2 billion cases of noncommunicable conditions will occur worldwide this century (Table 1). There are many reasons why these diseases develop in developed countries. First, some of them arise out of lifestyle choices related to smoking, drinking, obesity, poor diet and lack of physical activity; second, certain genetic factors predispose some populations to developing such diseases, including those who already have such diseases. Third, some pathogens cause infection through direct contact, such as by kissing or using contaminated objects, which can easily spread infectious agents across communities. And fourth, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and others carry HIV in the blood, and HIV is closely associated with chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, sleep apnea and Alzheimer's dementia. The role of environmental factors on the development of these diseases has received less attention than the roles of specific infections or their interaction with the immune system.

A person who has a heart attack may not be able to go out on their own. They may get sick so much that they can't work. In case of diabetes, if you have the condition, it will take your life. If you suffer from cancer, even though they can cause pain and suffering, at least they bring down your body's risk of dying. These are just some examples. We all need medicines but it's very important to know how to use them properly.\nA: For example, many people take drugs without understanding what they are doing because they think they're safe and effective. Some doctors treat patients based on a preconceived idea about which drug is going to help them. It doesn't always work that way. The more we understand the effects of different drugs, the better care we'll receive.\nA: We only want to provide good healthcare to our community members but it's also a privilege to give back to our society as well.

Share this","Most people have some form of chronic disease, even though they may not be aware of it. Chronic diseases include cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and arthritis. These conditions can cause significant financial pain and suffering to their victims as well as emotional damage and loss. Many chronic disease cases require treatment in order to control or prevent a complication that might lead to death or disability. The severity of these illnesses is also determined by many factors such as age, gender, race, ethnicity and occupation.\r

The National Health Interview Survey was initiated by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 and has been conducted every 5 years since then. This survey has collected information on about 9% of all U.S. adults since its introduction.\r


< Prev Next >","The typical type of disease that people with HIV face is a chronic illness. For example, diabetes is a very common chronic illness among people living with HIV infection. It may be caused by a genetic defect in one's cells or by an infection or other medical problem. There are also some rare cases of this kind of disease that occur only when a person has HIV infection but does not present any symptoms at all. In addition to HIV, there are other conditions related to HIV such as hepatitis B and C and syphilis which affect the body more seriously. These chronic illnesses can lead to serious health problems. People who experience them should discuss these issues with their doctors and obtain proper treatment.\nB: Which diseases are commonly diagnosed in people living with HIV infection? How many people are affected by each chronic condition? \N: A large number of people diagnosed with HIV infection are classified according to the different types of chronic diseases that they suffer from. These include: AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) - This is a long-term disorder affecting about 1 out of every 100 individuals. Most often, it is associated with immune deficiency disorders, which are disorders involving the immune system. \o1\People infected with HIV usually develop AIDS within their first few years of having an infection with the virus. About 50 percent of people diagnosed with AIDS die before the end of their lives. Those who survive the disease generally live relatively normal lives. Many people with AIDS go on to develop other diseases like cancer, HIV-related cancers, organ failure and other complications. Some of those with AIDS will die from their infections without ever knowing. That's why treating the infection early is important; otherwise, the disease could become incurable. \2\HIV positive patients, who receive appropriate treatment early on, typically avoid death from AIDS and tend to live longer than non-infected patients. However, there are still many deaths from AIDS because untreated HIV can cause other problems later in life. \3\Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), is another disease which affects about 10 percent of people infected with HIV. While people with HIV infection often don't know how old they were when they had the initial infection, they usually get tired easily after a while and find it difficult to keep up with daily activities. They may have trouble sleeping well. Another symptom is joint pain or stiffness. Many people with CFS suffer from a variety of problems that make it difficult to work or perform everyday tasks, including poor concentration, memory loss, difficulty concentrating, and irritability","The major cause of death in India is heart disease. It affects more than 1 billion people globally, while lung cancer accounts for about 2 million deaths each year. More than 90% of these deaths occur in low-income countries. Chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus (type II), hypertension, asthma and arthritis account for a large number of deaths worldwide. In India, about two thirds of those who die from heart attacks and strokes are women, but their mortality rates tend to be higher. \r

In general, we expect that a country which has better health outcomes will have lower levels of poverty. However, what happens when you look at what happens in developing nations where healthcare systems have not been developed? What does this tell us about how poor countries can develop? \r

The findings show that the impact on life expectancy per person was significant in both urban and rural settings with a strong link between population growth rate and the difference in life expectancy between cities and villages. Urbanites had an average 6 years less of life expectancy than ruralites, whereas there were no differences in life expectancy by gender or age group. \r

However, there were some notable exceptions to the pattern. For instance, while there was a strong relationship between a country's income level and life expectancy, it did not differ significantly by sex and age groups. As well, the correlation between income level and life expectancy varied substantially among different regions. When we looked only at urban areas, income was not associated with life expectancy. Likewise, the relationship between income level and life expectancy was much weaker in rural areas. In contrast, the positive relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy was strongest in urban areas and weakest in rural areas. This finding suggests that high incomes provide benefits to individuals in urban areas because they are able to consume more consumer goods and services while living longer. Conversely, poor households in rural areas may lack access to capital and face difficulties accessing credit markets. In other words, rural populations in sub-Saharan Africa experience greater vulnerability to economic shocks than urban populations. In addition, the negative impact on life expectancy observed between 1990 and 2010 was larger in urban settings than in rural ones, although the effect of income could be partially explained by the fact that the study sample included urbanites and rural residents of all ages and education levels. \r

Overall, we see that while the income gap is narrowing in many developing countries, there remains considerable variation across countries in terms of differences in longevity. To put things into perspective, we should point out that the richest","Chronic diseases are disease that can affect both individuals and social groups. While some of these conditions will continue to be in medical textbooks, they often take a long time to get better or disappear completely from one's life. The list below is not comprehensive but it covers many of the most common ailments: Diabetes

Alzheimer's Disease

Cancer

Glaucoma

Heart Failure

Stroke

Musculoskeletal Disease

Pancreatic Cancer

Neurodegenerative Diseases

Diabetes mellitus (type 1)

Multiple Sclerosis

Parkinson's Disease

Tourette Syndrome


Disease Treatment\nA: As with other health-related issues, treatment of any health condition should begin before it becomes an issue. To help prevent complications with your care, you should discuss all your current medications with your doctor. If you have diabetes, you may want to check into lifestyle changes that could reduce your risk of developing diabetes. Some people also find it helpful to talk with their family physician about how best to manage this problem.


Medication Management\nA: In addition to regular medications, certain foods or supplements may provide additional benefits. For example, if you're obese, eating less refined carbohydrates could increase insulin levels, thereby lowering your blood sugar. And if you suffer from depression, taking some of the more commonly prescribed antidepressants like Prozac might improve your mood, which would lead to improved sleep, and help you get through stressful times.


Behavioral Changes\nA: In addition to physical changes such as losing weight, self-help programs like exercise and dieting can help you overcome a number of mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. These programs require that you meet specific goals that involve changing your habits, including making healthy food choices and exercising. You may find it useful to consult with your family physician regarding the most effective ways to achieve these goals.","There is no single answer. For example, in a survey of 923 American physicians who dealt with diabetes, 7% reported that the prevalence of diabetes was increasing while only 4% said it had decreased over the last 10 years. A similar study found that 40% of respondents were concerned about their patients' future health, while 18% estimated they would be affected negatively by them or those around them. On an even larger scale, one study published in a medical journal showed that people living on less than $3 per day had a greater risk of dying from cardiovascular disease (CVD) than someone who earned more than $80,000 annually. CVD has been associated with obesity as well, with overweight being a major risk factor. In addition, many studies have indicated that individuals suffering from CVD also experience other serious illnesses such as cancer and high blood pressure, which can be exacerbated by diet-related factors. \r

\nE\:\u003cspan style=\""color:#fff;\""\u003eAs far as the average life expectancy at birth goes, there are two extremes - people born before 1900 and people born after 2000. While both groups show large decreases in mortality rates, the difference between the groups is very small.\r

The main causes of disease include: heart attack

heart failure

stroke

diabetes\nA: Diabetes is an autoimmune disorder that occurs in 20% to 50% of people with diabetes. There are many reasons why you may develop type 2 diabetes. It can be hereditary, it can occur as a result of lifestyle choices (such as smoking), or it can happen due to treatment (such as taking insulin). The risk for developing type 2 diabetes increases as you get older. In general, people who smoke tend to develop type 2 diabetes sooner than those who don't smoke. \rSec 2a : This study looked at the relationship between obesity and cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, triglycerides, and glucose levels. They found that higher body weight was associated with more cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, having a family history of cardiovascular disease was also correlated with greater cardiovascular risks.[1] \rSec 5: The results suggest that diet, physical activity, and genetic factors may influence the risk of getting stroke. To prevent strokes, you should minimize your total caloric intake and increase physical activity. If you already drink alcohol regularly, reduce your consumption to no more than 1 glass per day. This will help control blood sugar, improve your ability to metabolize carbohydrates, and decrease your risk of stroke. \rSec 6: Obesity is one of the major factors leading to coronary artery disease and other conditions related to atherosclerosis. A number of studies have shown that if you are overweight or obese you could be at increased risk of vascular events, including heart attacks, strokes, and sudden death from any cause. You can reduce your risk by cutting down on calories, avoiding over-exercising, controlling excess fat, and maintaining a healthy weight. To learn more about how to lose weight, click here. \rSec 7: Cardiovascular disease leads to many types of deaths. The American Heart Association says that cardiovascular disease is the second leading cause of death among men and women aged 65 years and older.[2] \rSec 8: People can die from complications due to heart disease, including bleeding disorders, myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure (CHF), angina, and peripheral arterial disease. These symptoms can range from mild to serious. Many of these are treatable with medications, surgery, exercise therapy, or even antiarrhythmic medication. Even small changes in diet can make a","The most commonly reported chronic disease is heart disease. This is followed by cancer, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, chronic respiratory disease and a variety of other conditions. Although some of these diseases may not be life threatening, they can lead to serious problems in one or more parts of our lives.\nA: Another factor that influences the quality of life of an individual is socioeconomic status, which includes race, age, sex, family history, education level, income, and geographic location. For example, people with incomes below 50 percent of poverty have less access to health care. People who live above 75 percent of poverty face higher rates of poor health than those living below poverty line.\nA: Some studies suggest that socioeconomic factors play a major role in determining both clinical outcomes and mortality. Many people will experience poor health because of their own choices, but others will suffer from lack of physical activity due to poor nutrition, poor housing situation, and inadequate social support or medication. For instance, obesity may increase the risk of all types of cancers including skin cancers. Other factors affecting overall health include tobacco use, high blood pressure, smoking-related illnesses like asthma, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. In addition to lifestyle factors, many studies also show that certain medications such as statins decrease the risk of developing certain forms of cancer. \nA: A study done at Columbia University showed that the incidence rate of lung cancer increased in New York City in the 1990s. While the number of new cases was reduced somewhat over this period, the overall number remained relatively constant. Since the majority of these deaths were attributed to non-smokers (mostly women), it seems likely that these deaths could have been prevented if there had been more smokers on the streets. Some epidemiologic research has shown that the prevalence of multiple sclerosis is higher among people who smoke.\nA: Smoking causes more damage than it does good. With each cigarette smoked, more tar is released into your bloodstream than you would get from a single piece of candy. You might think that the tar contained in tobacco would cause no harm -- after all, it comes out of your lungs. However, when you inhale, tar gets spread throughout your body, causing illness including cancer, heart attack, strokes, and lung infections. \nA: Smoking can affect how much oxygen you can take in and release through the lungs during exercise, resulting in the accumulation of carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide has been shown to lower immunity in animals. So, even though smoking may help","All chronic illnesses come in different forms, but some of them lead to more physical and mental problems than others. Chronic health conditions can be divided into four categories: 1) Cardiovascular diseases; 2) Oral and systemic infections; 3) Mental disorders such as depression, anxiety and schizophrenia; 4) Neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. For each category, the prevalence rate is given and categorized by country. \r

2)What is your opinion on the importance of public education about the prevention of cancer? How much would you say this issue has been neglected in our times? What are your views on the use of new technologies, like genetic testing and genomic mapping, which help us uncover many unknown diseases?\nA: Public awareness and treatment of cancers is a very important topic, especially when they occur in old people and those who are living with these ailments. Cancer affects men and women equally regardless of age or sex, even though there may be a slight difference between male and female risk factors for certain types. Many studies have shown that there is no clear link between lifestyle habits and risk of developing specific types of cancer. One key factor is the presence of an underlying tumor. This means that the person with the cancer will not have access to effective treatments, so he/she must remain vigilant. On average, 60-80% of cases of lung cancer in young adults in North America and Europe were found to be due to smoking (Cancer Causes Control 2008). More research needs to be done on the effectiveness of modern tobacco-free products, particularly since this area is still considered a very controversial one. \r

3)In light of the recent publication of cancer-related gene-environment interactions, what is the future direction of research in this field? What type of information should we expect from the results? Should scientists now focus their research on studying genes rather than proteins (a la biochemistry), where we might discover how genes can affect both protein synthesis and cell growth? In other words, could we see cancer as a ""synthetic"" organism, capable of using a wide range of chemicals and environmental triggers to develop its own body plan? Or does this notion only apply to viruses or bacteria that produce infectious agents? If so, what kind of research would make sense, and if it is feasible? And if not, what do we need to know to determine the true nature of the complex systems involved in cancer development and progression?\nA: Currently there is a great deal of interest in genome sequencing"

But the studies also revealed that physical activity may be associated with better outcomes for some patients with diabetes.

The evidence for exercise as a treatment for type 2 diabetes is mixed; some research suggests it may reduce blood glucose levels while others suggest it may worsen them. However, there are several different types of exercise that are associated with reductions in blood sugar, including aerobic exercise (exercising at moderate-to-high intensity), resistance training, swimming and weight training, according to the American Diabetes Association. Exercise has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and lower overall risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Studies show that exercise can help decrease blood pressure, improve muscle function and other measures.

People who are overweight or obese should consider exercising regularly if they experience symptoms of high blood sugar, such as irritability, fatigue and thirst, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Weight loss alone does not appear to prevent Type 2 diabetes from developing. Regularly exercising can increase your body's ability to metabolize sugars, which could help lower your body's need for insulin.","you are not alone! (2017-05-21 23:06:43)

Numerous studies on the health effects of certain types of caffeine use or consumption, such as for caffeine addiction. However, it is important to realize that any caffeine intake should be done in moderation and in accordance with your personal preferences. The more you drink the worse off you will become. If that is not true then take some time out from your daily routine. In addition, make sure you don't exceed the daily amount of alcohol by a large margin. There have been several reports where those who consumed enough coffee and tea each day were able to stop drinking alcohol completely after six months. You also might consider going a little lighter when it comes to food or alcohol consumption during this period. This can help reduce the negative side affects as well as give you a better chance at staying away from unhealthy habits later on down the line.

A: That's right! What we're trying to do here is get people who don't really know how they feel to be able to measure their feelings with these things, so they'll know exactly how they felt when they were exercising. We've been working on this idea of tracking something like one minute of each exercise for over two years now. This technology has changed so much since then and we're thrilled about how far we've come.

Q: Are there any ways to tell if someone will go through a workout? Can you tell what they look like or are they slim but not fat?

A: There's no way to tell at all unless you ask them after they leave the gym, but we certainly try to make sure that they're pretty healthy for themselves. When we start asking questions we see some amazing results, like people coming out looking like they've never had any other form of exercise before. They often say things like ""I haven't had a gym class in my life,"" which is a very good sign because usually people are pretty active before they begin getting into weight training. Once they stop exercising they tend to lose muscle mass quite quickly. It's interesting to watch as a person gains muscles from exercise, but they also lose strength which is another important thing to notice. So, in terms of monitoring, a lot of it comes down to being honest about what you're doing. As long as you're honest about how hard you're working, whether it's 60 or 100 reps per set—that means the harder you push yourself, the more strength you gain. Then you need to see improvement over time to know that someone is actually gaining muscle mass. In the end we want to be able to tell if they'll eventually work up to doing some kind of heavy lifting. For instance, if you asked people five days out of five if they would ever run 100 miles, only 10% would respond affirmatively, whereas if you told them five days out of five that they'd become physically stronger, 75% would respond affirmatively. You're basically talking about two separate outcomes: the first one is the increase in muscularity; the","I am a diabetic and have been for over 10 years.

22,Q: my risk for developing type 2 diabetes\nA:,"it depends on the individual. It may be a lot less for someone with a normal BMI, but your chance of getting type 2 diabetes increases as you get older.

Q: does this mean I have to stop drinking alcohol?

A: No, it's not that simple. We advise people with diabetes to limit their intake of carbohydrates and beverages containing sugar. In particular, avoid foods high in fructose and added sugars such as honey or agave nectar. A study found that those with type 2 diabetes who reduced consumption of these types of sugar by at least one-third were able to maintain normal blood glucose levels after surgery (9).

How much weight can I lose if I'm overweight?

If you're overweight, how fast you shed pounds depends on several factors. Firstly, your body mass index (BMI) – which is calculated using height and weight – should be between 25 and 30. Secondly, you need to gain weight over time to achieve and maintain a healthy BMI. There are some guidelines that you can follow to help you reach your target weight. The American Diabetes Association recommends losing 5% to 10% of your initial bodyweight each year. However, experts recommend only reducing your total daily calorie intake by about 150 calories per day. This will also encourage more exercise as well as eating healthily. If you start your diet right away, you can probably lose up to 15% of your initial bodyweight.","It's not a risk but it is a possibility. However, I don't believe that any of us are at high risk and we shouldn't worry too much about it either.

Q: when you first started with this study, did you have any concerns? A: In the beginning I didn't realize what an impact it would make on me if the study was found to be harmful. At first I thought maybe I will get a cold, or maybe I'll gain weight (because of the exercise). But after three months of the diet, my blood glucose levels were stable. And my body composition changed so I lost some fat and gained muscle. My metabolism was also improved and so was my energy level. It just felt like I got healthier and more active.

Q: how was your experience with other people? A: I met many of them through my blog. There were people who had been diabetic before me, and they all helped me out. I met a couple of other women in the blog community who seemed to be pretty healthy. Some of them even wrote letters to their doctors which made it easier for me to understand why they had problems with diabetes. Another woman wrote me saying that she decided to join the trial because she wanted to improve her health and well-being and she thought that the Diabetes Mellitus Prevention Program could help her do that. She was one of two women from New York City who participated in the program. This may seem strange since most of them had no idea anything was wrong with themselves, but I think this showed that there were still people out there who were thinking about doing something about diabetes, even though their conditions weren't really severe. So I think it showed a lot of hope to see that.

Q: What does your research involve? A: We're studying 12 women. Most of us are between 18-38 years old and our age range is between 45-70 years old. The participants' ages range from 21 to 55 years old. Our aim is to investigate whether regular physical activity and dietary changes can reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications, including cardiovascular disease and stroke. That means that we need to find out if we can reduce the numbers of calories that individuals consume during periods of low calorie consumption by reducing overall food intake. For example, instead of eating breakfast every day as we currently do, we could eat smaller meals throughout the day to avoid overeating in the morning. Or we could try to increase the amount of energy we require through increased physical activity, which could","you should see your doctor if you have any of these symptoms:

- headache, fatigue, or loss of appetite.

- stomach pain or bleeding.

- skin changes (such as redness, swelling, peeling, itching).

- depression.

Q: I was diagnosed with PCOS and found out that it's a hormonal disorder. What should I do now? \nA: It is highly recommended that you discuss this issue with your doctor before starting any treatment plan. If you are unsure whether or not to proceed, please contact your GP who can advise on how best to approach this difficult situation. There is no cure for PCOS, however treatments can be effective in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. Your Doctor will be able to provide further information about this matter upon request.

For women, there may also be some impact on breast development as well as infertility rates, particularly when combined with high levels of oestrogen. Although these effects have been noted anecdotally, it does seem that men experience similar problems.

Q: Can I take an injection to improve my fertility? \nA: Yes, but there is no specific treatment approved by the FDA to treat this condition.

Q: My ovaries are swollen so much that they hurt after sex. How can I stop having sex? \nA: Firstly, make sure that you aren't taking any medication which has caused this problem. Secondly, if it isn't possible to have sex without pain, then find another way to achieve orgasm such as by using lubricant, using vibrators, or by using some form of stimulation device. In cases where there isn't adequate time to try different methods of pleasure, masturbation or oral intercourse may still work. However, remember that vaginal intercourse only works approximately 50% of the time.

Q: I am diagnosed with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (HTS). How do I know what kind of thyroid disease I have? The doctors will look at blood tests (e.g., TSH) and thyroid function test results. They will then examine you thoroughly for signs of illness, including an increase in body temperature, difficulty urinating and excessive sweating. After examining you, they'll give you some medicine which will lower your T","I see no evidence that this is a problem.


I do not have a medical issue with weight\r


If I were to lose weight, would it lead me to develop Type 2 Diabetes?

Is it really possible to just cut out calories and start eating like crazy? What happens when you try to lose 100lbs??


[these questions are more related to weight loss than anything else]


The Atkins Diet may not be healthy or even worthwhile. It is a highly restrictive dietary approach to losing weight. You have to adhere to such a strict and regimented diet every day - which may be very hard. Your body may reject many of your food choices because they taste bad and/or may not be filling. It can also make you feel weak and hungry at times. I believe that people who follow a strictly low calorie diet should be given a second chance once their health improves. However, the Atkins Diet is not an easy way to lose weight - it is very difficult to stick with a strictly controlled diet of only 5-6 meals per day for many weeks or months...and may not work at all, depending upon your own personal situation! [more details in my blog post here] In short, I recommend that anyone considering going on the Atkins Diet make sure that he/she takes into account his/her needs before proceeding; if you have no health problems, then go ahead. If you want to find out what the real costs of the Atkins Diet are, read my book The Diet Myth. [my review copy is available online]","That's because I eat so much sugar. And that's the only way it can get into your bloodstream. If you don't eat, then there is nothing to ferment, and you won't get any extra insulin. You just have an excess of glucose in your blood.

Q: How do you know when your body has reached its tolerance?

A: We've been able to measure this by looking at how long our bodies take to respond to an increase in insulin levels. When we see a steady rise over a period of about four weeks, we're good to go. But if we start out with no response at all, we need to keep on monitoring, and eventually we'll get the full benefit of the high-sugar diet.

Q: What are the risks?

A: The most common thing with these diets is weight gain. A lot of people lose a great deal of their muscle mass as they go through the ketogenic phase – and this means that they end up eating too little calories and getting fat instead of lean. But that doesn't always happen. Some people manage to regain some of the lost muscle while maintaining their lower body mass. People who have been taking a low carb diet may also experience loss of their hair or nails, but this isn't usually noticeable during the first few months of following the diet.

Q: What's the best way to stay healthy during the ketogenic phase?

A: In the past, we used to encourage people to avoid exercise until they were ready. Now we generally recommend that everybody follow a moderate amount of moderate intensity exercise during the ketogenic diet. This will help maintain the natural hormones that regulate metabolism and help prevent the build up of triglycerides. It will also help fight hunger so that people are less likely to overeat.

More info: Ketosis 101","You can get the test done and if it says you have type 2 diabetes, that's good news. But I do not recommend you go into treatment unless there is a very real possibility of diabetes relapse and death or serious complications. If you are already taking insulin, be sure to use a low dose (like 10 units) and don't start taking more than this until your blood sugar gets stable.

Q: my health insurance does not cover these drugs\nA: My coverage doesn't extend beyond year 2015. However, since you will likely never need care from us again, we cannot pay for any out-of-pocket expenses in 2015. You could still choose to purchase insurance. We also charge an additional fee for services provided outside our office. Please check with your insurance company for details.

Q: Is insulin prescribed only by me? A: Yes, but usually it is prescribed by a physician who specializes in diabetes.

Q: How long can I take insulin without losing weight? A: You might lose some weight while taking insulin, however this depends on the drug used.","I don't think so! It can happen to anyone, but it is very rare.

Q: if you are going to the gym to lose weight and have a workout program, what kind of exercise should be done? Do you do cardio alone or with weights? A: I usually use weights. However, there's no question that aerobic activity (aerobic) would be a great thing to include in your daily routine as well. If that makes sense. Q: if you were to have an emergency, would you leave it up to fate and give up on trying to live life a little differently? How would you approach it if you did decide that it was time to change? A: Yes. But not without considering how important it might really be and taking steps to make sure it actually happens. And then, hopefully, being able to start from scratch again, starting fresh. Q: will you ever get married, what would you do if you had a child? What are some things you'd like to learn about parenting? A: No, never got married until age 15 when my parents decided they wanted more children. In fact, my mom tried to convince me of this several times during our high school years -- one day she said to me ""if you ever want kids, you're doing something wrong."" This was the first time I realized what that meant. The next day, before I could respond with any kind of explanation other than ""I'm just glad my dad has them,"" her husband walked into the room carrying a suitcase. He told me he had gotten married that day and was expecting his new wife, who wasn't even twenty yet. And I remember thinking, oh gosh, now I know why women who get pregnant rarely come back to their parents after giving birth. I wish I could say that I've always been lucky enough to grow up loving my father, but unfortunately that isn't true. By the way, since the end of my freshman year at Duke, I have changed jobs twice. One year I went into management consulting while the second time I started a side hustle called a marketing consultant. Both positions required me to spend two months traveling around Asia and South America working on projects where I gained valuable experience and networking contacts. I also spent quite a bit of time on various fundraising efforts by which I raised money for my friends and family. And all in all, I worked pretty much full-time from 9pm till 1 am, sometimes 3 days per week. At least, that's how it seemed","That's a very serious disease. You're not going to have this if you stay on your diet and exercise, but it can be really important to watch how much sugar is in your food.

Q: I hear that some people start eating too many sugar-sweetened beverages. How do they get those calories? Are there any healthy alternatives to that? A: The answer is yes, but it depends on the brand of beverage and what kind of carbohydrate is being consumed. Some brands are made with simple sugars like glucose, fructose, or lactose, which don't raise blood pressure or cause weight gain as quickly as higher glycemic carbohydrates, such as high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). If you drink a cola, make sure it doesn't contain HFCS. If you want to cut back, try drinking a sports drink instead.

Q: What should I avoid when it comes to sugar? A: Avoid all refined grains and processed foods including soda and sweeteners; limit added sugars in nonfat dairy products (such as yogurt); keep your total fat intake below 10% of your daily calorie needs; reduce the amount of fruits and vegetables you eat each day; choose unsweetened coffee over regular brewed coffee; try cutting back on saturated fats; and consume more fiber. Q: Is there anything else I should know about my diabetes? A: There are two main types of diabetes – type 1 and type 2 – and both can occur together. Type 1 diabetes develops slowly and usually does not progress. It occurs naturally within the first few years of life. Type 2 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that damages the pancreas and other organs and tissues throughout the body. This condition can affect anyone. Symptoms may include hives, rapid heartbeat, blurred vision, swollen feet or legs, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, joint pain, sweating, increased sensitivity to cold or heat, difficulty urinating, and skin rashes.

How we treat diabetes can impact your overall health. As noted above, insulin is the medication that controls the release of glucose from cells and increases metabolism and quality of life. In order to decrease risks associated with Type 2 diabetes, patients should follow specific treatment guidelines. For example, people with diabetes need regular monitoring by their healthcare providers and can take medications like metformin or metformin plus glargine (Miglitazone) to control blood sugar levels for up to 12 months.","yes, the risk of getting type 2 diabetes is increased if you have a high blood glucose level.

Q: if I eat more than 1,500 calories a day, can I still get type 2 diabetes? \nA: Yes, you may be able to avoid or reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes by eating less than 1,000 calories per day and maintaining a healthy weight. However, if you do not consume enough carbohydrates (such as in foods such as breads), vegetables, fruits, fish, nuts, beans or legumes (especially soybeans) to meet these needs, it is important to talk with your healthcare provider about whether this will help you avoid or reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Q: what's the best way to control my diabetes and prevent its complications? \nA: Your goal should be to get regular check-ups (biopsies and other tests are recommended) so that your doctors can determine the cause of any changes in your body chemistry, metabolism, or insulin sensitivity that may occur during treatment and how to take care of them. Also, it helps to limit the amount of sugar you drink - and avoid drinking excessively sweet drinks (e.g., soda or fruit juices). It may also help to take the medication metformin with meals, which is taken in pill form. And, make sure you keep your blood pressure under control and maintain an active lifestyle so that you don't become overweight while taking metformin.

Q: What does all of this mean for me? \nA: If you're at risk of diabetes, it is imperative that you seek medical advice from your doctor right away. There are many ways to lower your risk: You should consult your healthcare provider about any other treatments you've tried, including drugs, supplements, and natural products. These could be good things to try, but they may not work for everyone.

Your physician has the option of recommending a diet that emphasizes whole grains, fresh produce and lean protein - like poultry, seafood and eggs - instead of refined sugars and fat. They may also recommend making some adjustments to your medications, especially if they haven't been working well for you.

You'll need to see a specialist, either because there's something wrong with you or because you have health problems that aren't being treated properly. The sooner you receive diagnosis and/or treatment the better."
35,Q: Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?\nA:,"It depends on the individual's glucose tolerance. In general, it is best to stick to the basic principle of fasting and not to add anything else. If you want to try something special, see our FAQ page. \r

\r

Also note that there are some people who have had success using high-carb diets. Their bodies don't like their blood sugar being high in the first place, so they tend to start eating more carbs as soon as possible after going low-carb (or even ""dieting""). The problem with these guys is that they're getting sick from eating too much carbohydrate, which leads them back down the path of overfeeding/starving themselves.\nA: No worries! If you do go for high-fat or low-carb, your body will find ways around it, and this should be fine if you don't have an insulin resistance problem or have been taking any kind of diabetes medication. However, remember that when you follow a low-carb or low-fat diet, you'll likely have a higher glycemic load than usual. Your doctor might recommend lowering your GI or adjusting the way you take medications if you think you've got a serious issue with your blood sugars. \r

\r

If you're interested in making it through the day, here are some things I recommend. These are all pretty basic and can help make sure you get through without feeling bloated/sick (and also ensure you eat enough protein). Remember, you may need more than one of these things at once: 1) Eat breakfast - Make sure you wake up healthy and hydrated. 2) Eat lots of protein throughout the day 3) Have lots of fruits and vegetables 4) Exercise 5) Stay active 6) Get plenty of sleep 7) Read good books 8) Try out new foods. 9) Drink lots of water 10) Avoid caffeine - don't drink coffee; avoid colas; avoid soda (it doesn't work); limit tea and coffee, and especially avoid caffeinated energy drinks such as Mountain Dew or Gatorade. \r

\r

Keep in mind that not everyone has all of these needs met by default. For example, we know from experience how hard it is to keep a normal weight long term while following a very strict Paleo diet. So many people fall into the trap of overeating, which causes them to gain weight again later on. A lot of times, the only solution is a gradual rethinking of what is working well for","Yes, it's well-known that a low fat/high carbohydrate diet helps reduce blood sugar and insulin levels. It should be noted that there is no known downside to the use of ketosis by diabetics. Some studies have shown that some diabetic patients are able to maintain a healthy weight even though they may not be able to tolerate carbohydrates as efficiently as non-diabetic persons (3). However, other researchers find that low carb diets do not lower insulin levels significantly in adults.\r

\r

Ketosis has been considered an important factor contributing to some of the metabolic abnormalities observed during prolonged fasting or long term starvation \r

and suggests that low calorie diets that include moderate amounts of high quality carbohydrates may be an appropriate strategy for those with type 2 diabetes who need additional support for maintenance of their health status. In summary, ketosis is an effective treatment modality when used appropriately (2) and may provide benefits over current standard treatments for type 1 diabetes \r

\r

(6). Many questions remain about the effects of ketogenic diets on insulin sensitivity and whether this represents potential advantages of such diets compared with standard antidiabetes drugs. Although these results do not address all possible issues, we believe that greater knowledge regarding the mechanism by which ketones can help prevent insulin resistance and disease progression will improve our understanding of the role of ketone bodies in diabetes \r

\r

and enable us to develop more efficient strategies for the management of various forms of diabetes and related conditions.

Introduction A number of nutritional factors have been proposed as being responsible for altering blood lipid concentrations during periods of caloric restriction. These include increased availability of dietary energy, altered bioavailability of nutrients, changes in dietary macronutrients composition, and differences between individuals. As part of the ongoing effort to better understand how this process takes place and what it means, research has focused on the effects of low carbohydrate diets (LCD) on both lipids and insulin resistance. Most laboratory based models suggest that the body responds by making insulin to suppress the activity","Yes. I have been in ketosis since 2009 and would recommend it to anyone with diabetes who wants to reduce their carbs and calories (which may mean reducing the protein). If you are diabetic, this is not an option unless you need to lower your insulin level – which can be difficult if you're trying to lose weight or maintain your blood glucose levels without the use of medication. But there are other ways to do that. It's very easy to make ketones, so just keep eating until your body produces enough to see some benefit.

A common misconception among people wanting to adopt ketogenic diets is that they must consume all fat at once as opposed to consuming a wide variety of foods (such as carbs) throughout the day (a la Atkins) because it takes longer for the body to convert fats into fuel. This is incorrect. The more carbs you eat, the faster your body will begin converting them into energy. So in order to get the most benefits from such a diet, you should only take a small amount of each food – about 10-15 grams per meal. However, you don't want to take too much carbs; the goal is to build up glycogen stores before you start burning the stored sugars from those carbs. In fact, when you first learn how to make ketone bodies, it is advisable to avoid any high glycemic carbohydrates.

How Ketosis Works

Ketogenesis, or ""ketosis,"" is the process by which your body converts food into usable fuel. As we've already established, you can't go hungry while following a low carb diet. Therefore, after a certain amount of time has passed, your body begins using glucose for fuel rather than sugar. You'll soon notice your appetite goes down, your skin gets brighter (and pinker), and your digestive system becomes used to eating carbs. All of these effects are accompanied by improvements in blood sugar control (lowering your blood pressure and improving your heart health).

It also means that even though you're eating less carbohydrate overall, your body is still being fed glucose, but at a reduced rate – making sure the ketones continue to build up in your bloodstream (instead of accumulating around your liver or kidneys). Because of this effect, a ketogenic diet does not cause weight loss.

Because your body doesn't need to store excess fat as fat, a diet like a ketogenic diet can actually help prevent type 2 diabetes by lowering triglycerides. These cholesterol-laden particles accumulate on artery walls, preventing blood flow. They","Yes, keto diets are extremely beneficial to diabetics.\r

\r

I don't recommend a strict keto diet, but you should definitely make sure that your body is getting the rest it needs to recover from surgery!\r


What are some of your favorite foods and beverages from ketosis? Why do you enjoy them? \r

\r

My favorites include raw egg whites (especially blueberries), raw goat cheese, raw kale, raw spinach, raw apple cider vinegar, and raw pumpkin seeds. I'm also a big fan of green tea, which is an alkalizing agent, and coconut oil as a fat source.\r

I was going through an identity crisis when I went back into ketosis with Dr. Seuss' The Lorax in 2008. I thought that transitioning from being overweight and diabetic to having good energy would be difficult. It wasn't hard at all - I was doing very well until I turned 80! Now I have enough experience and knowledge to know what's best for me. I'll share my personal experiences so that others can see how easy it really is. For more information or to reach me directly please email [email protected].[/quote]\r","No, but you can make it work by reducing carbohydrates and increasing protein. For example, if your blood sugar is controlled, cutting back on calories from carbs will allow you to eat more fat without losing weight. You should also get enough sleep (or as much as possible) \r

so that your body is less sensitive to insulin \r

and allows it to use fatty acids in your liver to produce energy. See our guide to the basics of ketosis for more information about what this means! If you're concerned about gaining too much weight or not achieving good results with a ketogenic diet, try switching to low-carbohydrate diets (such as Atkins or KetoDiet). They don't contain any sugar or refined carbs \r

(except for lactose), so they'll be easier to manage than a high-fat, low-protein diet. \r

If you have other health conditions or illnesses that could affect glucose control, such as kidney disease, heart disease or stroke, we recommend that you take insulin before taking ketone supplements. This will help keep your glucose levels under control \r

while providing some extra energy. Read more about how to achieve optimal glucose control. Q: What are ketones made out of? A: Ketones are produced when fats are burned for energy, but they aren't actually converted into fuel \r

unless they come in contact with oxygen. When you burn fat for energy, you generate carbon dioxide (CO2); however, CO2 doesn't do anything good \r

when you have elevated blood glucose, which is why your metabolism slows down when you have diabetes. The most important role that carbon dioxide plays is to prevent oxygen from getting inside cells. Carbon dioxide traps excess water \r

in the cell walls, preventing them from dilating. In contrast, ketones can free up space within the cells, allowing them to stay open longer \r

so that new mitochondria grow and flourish, making them more efficient at using energy. Q: How many grams of protein per day do I need? Are there any special considerations around protein intake? A: Protein needs vary depending on whether you're following a low carb diet or a ketogenic diet \r

as well as how long you've been eating ketogenic diets. On a low carb diet, you typically require between 150 and 250g of protein per day. That's around 5% - 8% of your total daily calorie intake \r

(for","A ketogenic / keto diet can be very helpful in the treatment of diabetes. However, it is not necessarily appropriate for everyone who needs to lose weight or maintain a certain weight. People should consult their doctor before starting on this type of diet.

Q: What's an Atkins Diet?\nA: An Atkins diet is a low-carbohydrate diet that follows a strict high-fat diet and does not include carbohydrates. It typically consists of 20 grams per day of fat (mainly from saturated fats) and 35 grams of protein and other macronutrients (calories). The typical American diet has 70 grams of carbohydrate, 30 grams of dietary fiber and 65 grams of dietary fat. While there are several variations of the Atkins diet, most Americans follow a low-carbohydrate diet as described above. The Atkins Diet is usually recommended by doctors when treating patients suffering from diabetes.","Yes. Some folks who have Type 1 Diabetes may also benefit from a low-carbohydrate diet as an aid to weight loss and maintenance of insulin sensitivity. However, the keto diet is not recommended for everyone whose type of Diabetes necessitates a lower carbohydrate intake.

A: There are no clinical trials demonstrating significant health benefits from a Ketogenic Diet. The Atkins Diet is safe and effective for most people. The ADA guidelines recommend using the low-fat, high-protein ketogenic diet for patients with type 2 Diabetes, but do not recommend it as an appropriate approach for all people with type 2 Diabetes. For those wishing to follow a Ketogenic Diet without losing fat or gaining muscle (or both), we suggest that they stick with the Low Carbohydrate and High Protein diet.

A: This depends on your level of ketosis and the level of carbohydrates you consume. Generally speaking, if you're eating very low carb (~2g carbs per day) then a Ketogenic Diet would be classified as a Low Carb diet. If you eat more carbs than this (10g or less), then it's a High Carb diet.

For people who have low blood glucose (hypoglycemia), they should limit the amount of carbohydrates eaten during the day and try to achieve a balanced ratio between carbohydrate intake and fat intake. This is difficult if you are an insulin-dependent diabetic. It is also important that you understand your body's sensitivity to carbs and fats and how much you can eat without feeling sick or hungry. If you do well on a low glycemic load diet, the other benefits may be less noticeable because you will probably be eating more calories than usual in addition to fewer carbohydrates. \n

\salt\ n \/\/\/\/ salt\r

How much salt does someone need?\nA: Most people do not need as much sodium as people who follow a Mediterranean diet (see below). However, some adults (10% - 50%) require higher levels of dietary sodium due to their high blood pressure (about 1/3 of normal) and diabetes mellitus. People with kidney disease or severe kidney failure might need even greater amounts of salt, and pregnant women (20% - 40%) should avoid excess salt. In general, those over 65 years old (who should ideally follow a lower-sodium diet), need about 15 grams per day of salt, while children younger than 2 years old usually get enough sodium from food (but no more than 10 grams a day). The American Heart Association recommends starting at 5 grams per day and increasing by 500 mg each week. Adults generally need about 25-50 g per day; babies up to 3 months of age typically don't require more than 20 grams per day. Some research shows that people who have high blood pressure often need additional potassium, but this is likely related to their overall blood sugar level rather than specific salt requirements. If you are concerned about your sodium level, talk to your doctor, because it depends on many factors like what your baseline blood sugar was when you were diagnosed and how fast you've been losing weight. A person with a very slow metabolism would need more potassium than a person with a very fast metabolism. You can find more information about potassium intakes here: http://www.cdc.gov/kidney/facts/index.html. \n

What is the best way to maintain weight loss and reduce body fat during ketosis?

Ketones help reduce appetite and hunger, so losing weight can be easier when you are ketotic. However, it's important that you keep this in mind when you're trying to lose weight by cutting carbohydrates from your daily calories. You'll also want to eat enough fats (or other foods containing protein) to ensure that there is no change in your calorie intake after you start eating ketone esters. A good rule-of-thumb is to consume 1 gram of fat per kilogram of bodyweight every hour. A keto diet will not necessarily make you leaner than someone who does not follow this recommendation, so don't assume that just because you are following the keto diet, you must be thin if you do not meet these recommendations. The goal is to get closer to your ideal body weight before starting any weight loss program or diet.

How long should I wait between meals before starting a keto diet? \nA: In general, you should never eat two large meals within 24 hours of one another, even on a regular day. Many people believe that having one meal while sitting down makes them hungry, which is why they skip breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks on a ketogenic diet. This simply isn't true. We all know that the brain starts to work differently at different times of the day, and we need to let our bodies adapt. When the brain doesn't run as fast as usual, the body becomes much less active. Your body needs to switch from burning fuel stored in muscle tissue to burning fatty acids stored in liver and other parts of the body. There are many ways to burn fat without taking up too much energy (such as intermittent fasting), but the principle remains the same. To learn how to stay healthy and fit while fasting, check out my Ketogenic Diet Guide.

Do ketone ester supplements affect my blood lipid levels? \nA: While ketone esters certainly play a role in ketosis, the exact degree to which their effect on cholesterol is influenced depends on many factors such as personal preference and level of physical activity.","Yes, as long as you follow the guidelines in the Ketogenic Diet Guide. You may not need to restrict carbohydrates or sugar.

Q: Does it work?\nA: It works very well! And yes, I recommend the diet. It is safe and effective, especially if your body produces enough insulin.


What do we mean by a ketogenic diet? We use this term because our bodies can burn fat when it's available instead of glucose (glucose) which is used for energy production during starvation. This means that our metabolism slows down and we need less fuel for physical activity than normal. The ketogenic diet has been shown to help prevent type 2 diabetes and heart disease."
45,Q: Can diabetes be cured?\nA:,"No. There is no cure for it. But you can do things that will make the disease go away. That's a very important thing, especially in an old age when the body is already going through such a process of aging. It also helps to have some kind of lifestyle changes. When I was young, my father was always telling me about the importance of exercise and diet, so I've been doing that since then. And I still try to follow those instructions today. So there are many different ways to overcome this type of illness and maintain good health. Q: How did you become interested in cooking? A: My mother made me cook as soon as she got married, but because my father had taken over my kitchen duties, I didn't get much training until I graduated from high school. So one day I told her what I wanted to do with my life, and she decided to let me go into cooking. Since then I've tried a variety of recipes. After I started working as a waiter at a restaurant, people would ask me how I could possibly eat the food they served on their tables. Some people were able to tell that the foods I prepared weren't bad, while others said that they just couldn't believe that someone could be making them. In the end, after getting quite some experience, I realized that I don't actually need to have all sorts of different dishes, only to mix them together so that the overall taste matches well with the customer. Cooking has always been something I enjoy, so I figured I'd start making some money by selling something similar. Q: What type of company are you currently working for? A: I'm currently employed by a large department store chain in Tokyo called Gifu-shi. The job consists of serving customers' meals. Q: Why did you decide to work for this particular company? A: Because I'm really passionate about food, and I like cooking too. This may sound weird, but I am also looking forward to becoming a manager. Q: Do you have any hobbies or interests outside of your job? A: Not particularly. I like watching movies, reading novels, listening to music, playing games. Q: Is there anything else you want to share? (Note: He gave a long pause.) A: At first I thought of joining the army, but then I asked myself if it's worth risking my life for the sake of being part of a team and decided that maybe I should use my skills as a chef instead. I look up to professional chefs","Yes. It is a chronic disease and can only be treated with lifestyle changes. There are various options available to treat it. This may include insulin, diet, exercise, medications, and/or surgery. Diabetes Mellitus is not reversible.

Q: What causes type 2 diabetes?\nA: Type 2 diabetes occurs when there's too much or too little blood sugar in the body. People who have a parent or sibling with type 2 diabetes also have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Many of these people develop type 1 (younger) diabetes after adulthood.

Q: How do I know if my child has diabetes?\nA: You can check your child's blood sugar levels on the computer. Your doctor will tell you what kind of foods are best for them, but this does not mean they should eat those foods every day. Diabetic children often need special food diets. They should get their glucose measured at least once a month. You can learn more about how to do that here: http://www.diabetes.org/resources/guides/glucose-monitoring/. For adults, look at your child's medical records for any type 2 diabetes diagnosis as well as other information. If a family history of diabetes is present, ask your child's primary care physician whether he or she plans on giving him or her insulin injections.


Do I Need to Tell My Child?

A: No. As long as your child continues to follow recommended guidelines and is taking his or her prescribed medications, he or she should receive the insulin shots without hesitation. When necessary, you could choose to talk to your child's doctor about what he or she should or shouldn't consume during meals or snacks. The doctor should counsel your child to limit carbs and sugars throughout the day.

If your child has certain medical conditions such as kidney problems, heart disorders, or obesity, your child should speak to his or her health care provider about ways to manage the risks and benefits of eating certain foods during certain meals or snacks.

Should I Talk to My Child About Eating Sushi? \r

A: Yes. Eating sushi is associated with reduced rates of diabetes. However, eating sushi does not automatically mean someone is diabetic. In fact, some people take medications designed to reduce the level of glucose in their bloodstreams, which may increase the chances of being diagnosed with diabetes. Some people even try to avoid the types of foods that make them feel like they might become diabetic by limiting calories","Yes. But there is a huge amount of work to do. Some patients can have remission, but the cure rate for diabetic retinopathy in general and diabetic neuropathy in particular is very low. It's not even one percent. And it depends on the type of diabetes, what you've got, how old you are at the time. There are some people who get better with medications that help prevent neuropathy from coming back into place, so I think it can be possible, but we're still years away.

Q: What can you tell me about your own experience with diabetes?

A: My father, my grandfather, was an alcoholic when he was younger. He got drunk all the time, would pass out, drink himself sick, just went straight off. Then at age 20 or 21 he started having trouble walking. That was his first sign of diabetes. The doctors said ""he needs surgery,"" and they didn't know what to expect. He had nerve damage, and they put him on a cocktail of drugs called antidiabetic, which did nothing. So they left him there, and then he died two months later of heart failure. In our family there were always discussions about whether or not to go ahead with the operation. We decided against it because we couldn't afford it. By the time we could afford it, we found out he'd been drinking again, and it became clear that this wasn't going to be any different. My mom had lost her job due to a change in the company insurance policy; she couldn't afford to pay for it anymore. She took care of her son, and he ended up losing his job as well. Even though he never drank alcohol ever again, he continued to take his meds every day, which made his condition worse. As he grew older, he developed complications with his kidneys, and he stopped taking his medication altogether. When his health stabilized, they decided to do something drastic. They wanted to move him to the hospital, where he'd spend four days in intensive care before he was released into the community. Unfortunately, it wasn't like a hospice either, because his conditions weren't improving. Instead, they turned him over to a rehabilitation center so he could continue his lifestyle in the hopes that this might speed things up enough that a return to full-time employment could follow. They gave him his last meal, and he ate it while sitting in a chair, with a tube tied around his neck, and then he stayed there until his body died. A","\NONE.

What was your favourite part of The Walking Dead and why?\n

The Walking Dead's storyline has been outstanding from start to finish. It always seems like there will be some big twist or reveal that gets everyone talking about the next episode, which makes you feel even more excited to watch. I have a lot of respect for Rick Grimes and his character in particular, as he constantly challenges himself mentally and physically. However, if my son had been alive when the first season started, he would've also been involved in the same kind of story line, but perhaps not in the same way.\r


\r

How did you come up with the name ""The Governor""?\r

My wife called me one day while we were watching television and asked what I wanted my new job title to be. She said that the governor (a real person) used to refer to a town without electricity. To her surprise, she didn't think I'd actually want to work in that kind of environment. At the time, I thought about how great it would be to have an office/room where people could just walk around and talk freely. So when my friend told me the title, I immediately thought of the show. After a few days of searching on Google, I found out the governor is named after Abraham Lincoln. When I realized the connection between the two names, I knew exactly what I should call myself.\r


\r

Is there anything else you would like to add?\r

I love being able to bring so many different kinds of characters together into such a compelling narrative, and I'm proud of every single one of them who works hard to make their unique presence felt in each episode. For those who don't know me yet, let me say that I can easily be recognized by the fact that I wear glasses. However, I wouldn't worry too much about it as I always try to keep my eyes open for any signs of danger or emergencies.\r

Diabetes is not curable. It will always be with you. \r

As long as our bodies are in good condition they can survive on very little glucose (glucose from fat or alcohol). If your blood sugar exceeds 150 mg/dl you may need extra insulin therapy to keep it under control. You must also avoid high-fat foods such as bacon and red meat and limit processed sugars.\r

You cannot expect to make improvements overnight. This is why it is important to take regular blood tests. Your doctor may prescribe special diets for those who have had type 2 diabetes. They should aim to reduce their calorie intake by 50% over two months. For those who do not respond quickly enough or are unable to manage their own weight then dieting alone can lead to even more weight gain, particularly if calories are restricted severely. People at risk of becoming overweight should avoid eating large amounts of food which contains high levels of fats, salt and carbohydrates and have other healthy dietary habits.\r

For many people, diabetes becomes worse during pregnancy. Diabetes affects the development of the placenta and the growth of babies; therefore, there are risks associated with diabetes during pregnancy. Women with gestational diabetes should avoid having any kind of physical activity before or after delivery unless absolutely necessary. In this case, it would be wise to stay away from fast foods or alcohol until the baby is born. Any pregnant women who suffer from type 1 diabetes should watch closely for signs of low blood sugar and consult their GP. For men, treatment with oral medications may help some people with their symptoms but there are no effective treatments available for diabetics in general. Many people living with diabetes become so sick that they feel hopeless when they try to lose weight. There are simple things that can be done to maintain a normal weight. The healthiest way to eat is to eat a balanced diet containing plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and beans. Avoid refined starches and fillings in all forms, including dairy products, gluten free breads, biscuits and pasta. Eat lots of lean protein, unsaturated fats and fish. Vegetarians should choose a wide range of non-dairy sources of protein like pulses, nuts, seeds and legumes. Fruits and vegetables also contain fibre, essential vitamins and minerals.

[21] The answer to this question depends on what the disease is, and how much insulin it needs to suppress blood glucose levels before it can go into remission. We know that about one-third of people with type 1 diabetes (and another third of those with type 2) have no evidence of disease. If we take a look at our existing medications, there are four treatments available for this condition. \r

\r

Insulin shots \r

The most widely used diabetes drugs today are called insulin injections. These are very effective in suppressing blood glucose levels and reducing the risk of developing complications such as kidney failure and heart attacks. In other words, if you use an insulin injection, your chances of having these problems will greatly decrease. Insulin shots aren't perfect, however. There's always a chance that someone might get sick while taking them and develop a serious allergy or infection, and they could even cause brain damage. \r

\r

In addition to insulin injections, there are also two types of oral medication which help control blood sugar. They're called glucometers, and they work by getting rid of excess insulin from the pancreas when the body doesn't need to use it. Both medications require frequent monitoring and don't cure all cases of diabetes. \r

\r

As far as curing, though, there certainly are some clinical studies that show that lowering blood sugar can make people healthier overall. For instance, patients who have had successful diets for several years after their first diagnosis often regain control of their diabetes within six months. \r

\r

Another treatment is called metformin, which has been shown to slow down the rate of progression of type 2 diabetes. Metformin has two effects. It stimulates insulin production in the liver so that the bodies can stop producing more and more insulin itself. And it prevents pancreatic fat cells from becoming resistant to the insulin produced by the pancreas. This means that fewer calories are needed to keep up the body's daily metabolism. That means less weight gain and less pressure on the kidneys. \r

\r

However, metformin isn't the only approach for treating diabetic complications. We've already mentioned that there are other medications that can act like antibiotics in the case of infections and in the case of ulcerative colitis. Another drug, metformin sulfate, is very popular among diabetics because it improves both the function","It can. Diabetes is a chronic disease that requires ongoing management, and you need to work with your doctor and lifestyle changes. Your doctor should determine the best treatment plan for your specific circumstances. For example, if you're taking insulin because your blood sugar level is too high or you have type 2 diabetes, you may want to increase your intake of healthy food such as fruit, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, low-fat dairy products, and more. This will help lower your risk factors and improve quality of life. (For more information about this topic, see Chapter 5.)

What are the symptoms of diabetes?\nThis section describes the symptoms of Type 1 diabetes. Some people may not feel any symptom at all, while others may experience some pain in their legs or feet when they sit down, shake their body, move around, or take other physical activity.

What causes Type 1 diabetes?\nSome research suggests that genes play a role in determining whether someone has type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. However, there is no single gene that causes diabetes. Instead, several genes appear to play an important role, particularly one known as PPARG, which promotes the production of beta cells and results in the accumulation of fat and white cells in blood vessels. Researchers believe that this contributes to the development of Type 1 diabetes. In addition, certain foods, including those containing fructose, also contribute to the development of diabetes.

Can I get diabetes from eating too much carbohydrates?\nWhile it's possible for people who don't suffer from Type 1 diabetes to eat large amounts of refined carbs, the evidence linking these carbs to the development of Type 1 is inconclusive. For instance, a study published in 2004 found that adding glucose to meals lowered blood glucose levels by just 3 percent and did not significantly affect markers of inflammation in the blood. Similarly, studies have suggested that the amount of sugars consumed might influence how well a person's pancreas works. Research into Type 1 diabetes has focused on the relationship between excess calories and weight gain. For instance, a recent review article in Nutrition & Metabolism examined data compiled through 1993 from more than 20 randomized controlled trials and concluded that while there was ""an association"" between higher protein consumption and increased risk of obesity among overweight individuals, this effect appears to depend largely on caloric content of the diet rather than total calories consumed. The authors concluded that ""no plausible mechanism exists for the association between excessive dietary carbohydrate intake and increasing rates of obesity."" However, another report published in January 2011","Yes, yes it can. Diabetes is not a disease but rather an illness caused by abnormal glucose levels in the body\r

1. Introduction\r

The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is frequently made after a person has been diagnosed with diabetes earlier in life. This may occur if a parent becomes aware that a child is diabetic or if an older sibling learns about his or her condition. In both situations, many parents fear that if they seek treatment for the child, it could lead to complications later in life; such concerns may arise because children who are diagnosed early may have already progressed into adult-type diabetes or because adults with T1D develop diabetes through other means than pregnancy or diabetes. In either case, these fears can cause confusion and delay diagnosis. In addition, there are some people whose prognosis for T1D does not improve when they receive treatment for T2D or treatable forms of noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). This section discusses how T1D is diagnosed, what type of diabetes is present, whether it develops within a period of time following diagnosis, and when it might benefit from medication.\r


2. Diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetic Neuropathy\r

Diabetes results from abnormal glucose levels in the blood.\r

In people who have type 1 diabetes, glucose levels rise and fall with increasing amounts of insulin.\r

According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), normal values for the amount of sugar produced per unit of protein is 2 grams per kilogram of body weight per day; this is approximately 0.6 percent of total calories consumed in the United States and 5 percent of caloric intake from carbohydrates (5). For comparison, the average body mass index (BMI) for men is 25.0 to 29.9.\r

Type 1 diabetes also occurs in those individuals with type 2 diabetes. A person with type 2 diabetes is usually younger than 30 years"

They include various forms of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), as well as traditional herbal remedies such as Ayurveda, homeopathy, chiropractic, naturopathy, etc., and they are sometimes referred to as ""integrative"" medicine. When used in this context, 'holistic' can be interpreted to mean all of these approaches combined together. To be more specific about their focus and goals, holistic medicine includes all methods which aim at providing comprehensive information on an individual's physical and psychological states of mind and body, including diet, exercise, stress management, sleep, nutrition, hygiene, medication, and lifestyle changes.[2]\nA

The definition of holistic has been expanded over time by proponents of integrative medicine who have sought to define holistic based on its ability to address both the body and mind. In addition, the concept of 'health' as defined here has evolved from a general concept regarding overall well-being into one focused on how health is experienced within each human life span. Health is thought to encompass many things which can be achieved through a number of ways, but typically includes personal, social, spiritual, family, organizational, economic, environmental, educational, and occupational factors.[3][4] \nA

Definition [ edit ]

Holism is often described as a positive view of reality rather than a dichotomy between 'good' and 'evil.' However, when applied to specific medical conditions and treatments, the term has some negative connotations. Holism encompasses the idea that certain illnesses and diseases may not necessarily require treatment with medications or interventions, and thus, can often be treated without harming the patient.[5] It also implies a sense of responsibility for treating patients, as opposed to simply using them as a source of income;[6] the term was originally coined by Dr. James D. Gardner, a prominent proponent of integrative medicine.[7] Holism also focuses on the individual's capacity to self-regulate their own behavior, as well as the patient's freedom to choose appropriate courses of action.[8][9]

Examples [ edit ]

See also [ edit ]","In general, a holistic approach seeks to improve one's quality of life with knowledge about the body as well as natural healing. The term 'healing' includes any action that improves overall health or quality of life. It also includes improving the way one sees their own body or the world around them. This can be by understanding how the environment affects our bodies, for example if they are exposed to environmental toxins such as lead or mercury from contaminated toys or water sources. Or simply living in harmony with one's surroundings, whether this means eating organic foods or avoiding certain chemicals. If you want more information on this concept please read our blog here http://www.samskierner.com/blog/2013/02/06/mindful-meditation-holistic/.\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nI\nJ\nK\nL\nM\nN\o\p\rP\s\t \rSecNextDay","The term ""holistic"" comes from the Greek word for knowledge, which refers to how a person understands the world around them. For example, if you understand that sunlight causes your skin to burn more when exposed to it, then you may choose not to get sunburned. On the other hand, if you only know one thing about sunburns, you might opt to cover up. \r

The use of herbs as medicines has been used for thousands of years, but in recent decades they have gained popularity due to their efficacy against different diseases. A number of herbs are listed on our Herbal Medicine List for more information.


Healthy, Detoxifying Lifestyle (Herbology)


1. Eat healthy, natural food. You do not need to eat anything unnatural or unhealthy to be healthy. Many people have noticed that the foods we normally think of as ""healthy"" contain chemicals and preservatives that can harm us. In fact, eating organic fruits and vegetables and avoiding processed foods is probably more important than ever before. \r

For example, an apple contains approximately five teaspoons of pesticide residue. Similarly, there is more pesticide residue in some processed foods than in fresh produce. As an alternative to pesticides, try eating whole grains, nuts, seeds, and fruit. These nutritious foods will provide all the essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, phytonutrients, antioxidants, and enzymes needed to fight infections, viruses, bacteria, and fungi. \r

2. Exercise regularly. While many believe exercise must take place at least twice per week, this is often not true. When you exercise, the muscles in your body contract, releasing hormones and substances that stimulate growth and repair. This can increase your energy levels and help maintain a healthy weight. If you're not exercising frequently, then it's hard to build muscle tissue in your arms and legs—which can cause back pain. \r

3. Drink plenty of water. Drinking too much water can lead to dehydration. According to a study by researchers at the University of Chicago, excessive drinking could result in increased mortality rates for men and women over age 65. However, these researchers suggested that if you drink enough water while following these guidelines, it would reduce the risk of dying prematurely. One tablespoon of water per day is recommended. \r

4. Sleep regular hours and stay hydrated. Although sleep loss affects the quality of life, excessive sleep loss can also be deadly for humans. Even short shifts in sleep are critical, since","It consists in the application of a particular system of knowledge to an individual problem. The system may be as simple or elaborate as one wishes, but it should not be confused with conventional methods. For example, if you are suffering from chest pain, chiropractors are often trained to apply acupuncture (a form of traditional Chinese medicine) to your chest. However, when the treatment fails, they might prescribe other remedies such as homeopathy for colds or cold medicines for fevers. Other methods may include herbal treatments, exercise therapy, massage, vitamins, minerals, herbs, etc... In this way, the doctor has not just applied his or her own ideas and experiences to the patient's problems; he or she has also used the best available scientific research data on various diseases, illnesses and conditions to determine which approach is most effective in helping the person. Some medical practitioners call these systems ""integrative"" because they use both natural therapies and new drugs to treat disease. And while many individuals who have received medical care over the years are now able to choose their doctors, there are still those patients who require regular visits, especially children and the elderly. Many people find that in order to receive good health, it helps to know some basic information about the body, its functions, healing modalities, and how to recognize any symptoms that may indicate illness or injury. When you visit your doctor for routine check-ups or follow-up appointments, you can ask him or her questions about the process. If the doctor has read and researched the literature on your situation thoroughly, he or she will likely refer you to an integrative practitioner with experience in treating diverse types of chronic diseases. \nA: Can I use holistic medicine with certain medications and supplements?\nA: Yes! If prescribed by a physician, the following medications and supplements may all be considered part of holistic medicine. The type and amount of each medication and supplement, however, is determined by the type of illness being treated. It is important to note that not every prescription medication may actually be included in the list above. There is no single method or theory that determines whether a given drug or supplement may be accepted by patients receiving these treatments. Many medications are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for specific indications only, which means that a prescriber must decide which one(s) of these substances would work best for their patients. Even then, it is very difficult to predict exactly how a given substance will work for everyone and which ones will simply be ineffective. Therefore, the following","It includes the following aspects of health, as defined by the National Health Service (NHS): Physical and mental well-being; family life; social relationships; economic wellbeing; community engagement, which can be defined in a wide variety of ways, including those relating to education, employment or housing.

Healthy people are able to live long, healthy lives, and this is achievable through a range of complementary and alternative medicines that may help address certain conditions. In addition, some complementary medicine therapies may have an impact on chronic diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes. These therapies may also improve the quality of life for patients with depression or other mood disorders. In addition, they may lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels. As part of their treatment, many complementary medicines may prevent certain types of cancer, such as breast, bowel and prostate cancers, cervical cancer, ovarian and pancreatic cancer, as well as skin and eye diseases. Many of these treatments are also effective at treating other medical conditions. For more detailed information about how complementary medicines work and where to get them please read the chapter on complementary medicines and cancer. The National Institute of Complementary Medicine has published a list of over 3,000 complementary medicines. For further information please click here. \r

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) is a statutory body responsible for leading evidence-based health policy and practice. It publishes guidelines on complementary medicine, including those for use in clinical trials. These guides will continue to be updated to reflect new evidence and developments in complementary medicines. They were developed using advice from experts who know how to design and run controlled trials and provide the best possible guidance for public health authorities across England. Nice's Guidelines for Complementary Medicines, published in March 2018 offer additional information to clinicians and patients. \r

You can put it into any context you want, but the key point is that it's about all of your body functions being balanced; you're not a person with cancer because there are so many things in your body to balance out. There are so many different kinds of energy systems. When people talk about holistic, they're referring to the whole organism.

If I don't provide proper nutrition for my children, or if I let them get sick, it impacts them. This type of holistic thinking doesn't just mean treating your health problems with herbs and vitamins; it also means making sure your immune system gets its nutrients from foods like fruits and vegetables.\nA: You've said that holistic medicine is just an extension of traditional Chinese medicine, that it's a mix of traditional treatments with modern science. What did you use when doing research on this field? How much do you see yourself changing your practice based upon this knowledge?\nA: Well, the first step was to figure out what was going on inside of patients' bodies, because that's how the body works. We knew there were some problems with immune function, but there wasn't a lot of information. So we started looking at different areas of the body, such as the liver, kidneys, blood vessels, etc. The more we found out, the better we understood where exactly those problems were occurring. Then, when it came time to find specific remedies, we looked around the world for natural remedies that might work. As far as I know, there are no medical books on the market today that teach practitioners about herbal medicines. That's why I feel like there's an opening up. Because now, if somebody wants to learn these methods and apply them in their own life, then maybe that opens the door for people to really understand how it works. A few years ago, there was a big backlash against alternative medicine. People had concerns about doctors saying ""I'm not gonna tell you what to eat."" They worried if someone ate something wrong, they would die. Now there's a growing awareness of these techniques and how they may be useful to others. There are even organizations that say we should take over public education efforts and make every doctor take a class. Now, who knows what will happen. If we","In general, holistic medicine includes not only the study of nature, but also that which lies within the human body and its environment. This means not only treating disease through natural methods such as herbs and supplements but also taking an active role in caring for and providing care to people who suffer from various conditions. The main focus on holistic medicine is on prevention instead of curing or improving the condition of a patient.

Q: Who are some of the patients that you recommend using for treatment with holistic medicine? A: I have always felt strongly about preventive medicine, because my mother suffered from diabetes when she was younger. Her blood sugar levels were very high and she had difficulty walking due to it so I encouraged her to eat healthy foods (and even found out about herbal remedies). When I first started using herbal medicines, it took me many years before I could tell that they worked! My mother used to be one of those patients where if there was any form of medication, she would go into diabetic shock if left untreated. She was treated with insulin injections for the first 6 months after diagnosis so I don't know how much of the problem stemmed from this but I still can see how debilitating the experience was. There were lots of treatments but I still remember being afraid to use anything other than standard anti-diabetic medications until I saw a few doctors who recommended the use of herbal remedies. That's why I have been doing my own research and now try to find a remedy every few weeks. It can take up to 3-6 months for something to work properly once it has been tried but the results do seem to improve over time.


The treatment that I am currently working on is based around herbs, a combination of two of them called ""Gardenia"" and ""Lobelia"". Gardenia is a plant that grows near water and is often used as a traditional Chinese medicine. Lobelia flowers contain more vitamin C which has been shown to treat diabetes and heart problems. For those of us who have already taken allopathic forms of medicine, we will feel better knowing that our health may actually be improved by adding a little bit of Nature Medicine to our medical regimen.

In regards to the studies that support holistic medicine, Dr. Robert D. Besser writes:\nOne thing to keep in mind when looking at studies regarding holistic medicine is that many of these studies included individuals with compromised immune systems. While some of the therapies described were believed to have positive effects on the immune system, this isn't necessarily true for everyone. In fact","A holistic approach to health care includes a healthy body, mind, and spirit. It includes the prevention of disease; the treatment and cure of illness; healing from disease; and a sense of connection with nature in order for one's body and self to be well. In other words, holistic therapy involves treating all areas that are affected by illness, including the physical as well as the mental (physical illnesses include pain, stress, sleep disorders, mood swings, etc.)

Vitamin D deficiency is also a common issue, especially in children. For this reason, some doctors recommend taking an oral vitamin D supplement. There are several options on the market now, but I am currently using the Daily Multivitamin and 2,000 IU of Vitamin D3 daily along with two other supplements, which provide me with roughly 700 IUs of vitamin D. The Daily Multivitamin has been helpful for my overall health and I have noticed significant improvement in my skin condition. My doctor says that the daily intake should not exceed 3,000 IU or 400 mg. of vitamin D per day. As we age our bodies begin to lose their ability to make vitamin D. If you want more information on how much vitamin D you can take at any given time, see this link here. You may have seen them advertised in magazines like Allure and People magazine. They claim to give your body 25% of your recommended daily allowance of vitamin D. This is an estimate based on a study done in 2002, where about 1/4 of Americans were found deficient, so the actual number could vary. It would be wise to do a blood test before purchasing these products as there are no studies showing that they work. The main problem is that most people find that even when taken correctly, there is still too little vitamin D. However, if you are looking for something to help boost your vitamin D levels, take this product. It contains a supplement made from algae called Phytic Acid. If you read the label, it claims that you can use it during pregnancy. However, we did not notice any side effects to our baby, so we took it anyway. We saw a reduction in breast tenderness and decreased swelling of our nipples after just three weeks. Although the Daily Multivitamin isn't necessary, it will definitely help increase the amount of vitamin D you get. Some people might prefer to consider a multivitamins that contain a combination of vitamins and minerals. While there are many different kinds of vitamins and minerals available, you'll probably need to find something with","Well, in the last century or so, there have been a lot of different approaches to healing that incorporate both traditional practices such as shamanism and alternative approaches, like acupuncture. It's also important to note that holistic medicine has not always applied itself to diseases that were traditionally treated with conventional medicine (such as cancer). There are still some people who consider themselves holistic but don't practice any form of holistic medicine. In fact, many mainstream practitioners in traditional healers' communities do not even use the term. The word ""holistic"" has also come into common parlance for a wide variety of things -- from nutritional supplements to herbal remedies and homeopathic remedies. A number of natural products have now entered the marketplace on this basis. For example, you can buy vitamin C capsules at Wal-Mart that claim to contain 100 percent pure vitamin C. But they're really just sugar water capsules made out of corn starch, which you may know by its brand name, Fanta. The same goes for the botanical supplement company L'Oréal Paris' ""Natural Beauty Vitamin C."" These brands generally offer a mixture of vitamins and minerals, plus antioxidants like carotenoids and other substances that protect your skin against free radicals. \r

Some people think the term ""natural"" means that certain ingredients aren't harmful; in reality, some natural chemicals can be dangerous. So what exactly is natural? Most people would agree that it doesn't mean anything good -- only that a particular substance has no side effects. That's why we often say something like ""it tastes good,"" or ""this product smells great,"" rather than saying, ""This is really healthy!"" \r


What is holistic medicine, then? According to Dr. Gary Null, a physician and author of Healing Natural Medicine, the term implies that there is no harm involved when using a specific substance as an adjunct to conventional treatment. Rather than just taking one drug to treat all kinds of ailments, he says, modern medicine tends to focus more on the individual component parts of a therapy and less on the whole thing -- which can lead to problems.\nA\nIn the past two decades, there has also been a significant shift away from focusing primarily on treating symptoms over curing disease. Instead, physicians are increasingly emphasizing prevention rather than cure, including diet, exercise, lifestyle changes, stress reduction, mental health counseling and medication. One benefit of this approach, according to Dr. Null, is that patients typically respond better to these approaches. So instead of simply trying to help them"
52,Q: What are the most common mental health problems? How can I prevent or manage the most common mental health problems?\nA:,"Many people struggle with depression, anxiety and bipolar disorder. People who are depressed may be anxious. They might have thoughts of suicide and self-harm. This is called ""negative mood."" There's also a risk of eating disorders in which you don't feel good about your body.\r

Depression is one of the leading causes of disability around the world. \r

\r

Many people also suffer from other mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, panic attacks, mania or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). \r

If someone has any of these serious issues, they need to seek help immediately. You can talk to them on the phone, take them to see a psychiatrist, or get help at their local hospital or GP practice.\r

\r

Treatment options include medication that helps relieve symptoms. Some medications are available only by prescription and must be taken by some patients every day. Others can be prescribed to anyone at low cost. Some psychiatric drugs can cause side effects. Call ahead if you're unsure whether treatment will work for you.\r

How do we keep people safe on the road?

The Road Safety Agency works closely with the police to make sure everyone travelling on UK roads is doing what they should. We use all reasonable means to detect illegal activity along the route including roadside checks, CCTV cameras, signs and markings. For example, road safety officers patrol roads frequently. If you've been stopped or questioned by a traffic officer, it would be helpful to tell us why you were being asked to move while you're still speaking to the officer. Please note that if an officer has reason to suspect that you're guilty of any offence, he or she may ask you to step aside until we investigate further. Police staff carry out random breath tests at stops, but there are no random spot checks. In addition, roadside patrols are part of routine operations across the country and regular enforcement actions are carried out throughout the year. Police officers will not stop someone simply because they think they look suspicious – this includes when using mobile phones or taking photos. The police are not authorised to search passengers or vehicles unless they have been requested to do so under section 44 of the Transport Act 1996. Motorists must always wear a seatbelt and give consent before entering private property (for example,","The following table shows that anxiety and depression have the highest rate of prevalence among all people. In addition, these disorders also affect roughly one-fifth of the population. Anxiety disorders affect between 1 in 10 and one in seven adults (21% to 27%), while depression affects more than half (56%) of those ages 18 to 64 years old.\r

How is it diagnosed? Most commonly, an adult will seek medical attention if they experience one of the above symptoms. Treatment may include medication, therapy, or both. There are three primary types of treatment for depression: medications: drugs such as SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), SNRIs (selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) \b\ which generally have milder side effects; psychotherapy: a variety of techniques used to help patients work through their emotions and cope with life's problems. Social support (e.g., family, friends): Individuals who do not receive adequate social support often struggle with depression and other psychological issues. Research suggests that relationships with others can play a role in mitigating some of the negative effects of depression. If you are struggling with any type of depression, seek professional help right away!\r

http://www.mentalhealth.org/Depression/Pages/Depressed_Personality_and_Psychological_State.aspx","Mental Health disorders are among the leading causes of disability worldwide, and they cause significant suffering. Symptoms of these illnesses include anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic attacks. Other symptoms that may be present in a person with an untreated mental illness include: depression; post-traumatic stress disorder; schizophrenia; bipolar disorder; substance abuse; eating disorders including anorexia nervosa and bulimia; and substance dependence. The National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH), part of the NIH, has developed a set of diagnostic criteria to diagnose each mental health condition. These criteria help identify individuals at high risk for developing more serious mental health conditions. For example, people who have an anxiety disorder or other anxiety-related condition may need to see a healthcare provider regularly for symptom control. They should not work unless they take medication that treats their symptoms. Some of the most common medical conditions are listed below: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADD/ADHD);

Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).

Depression;

Postpartum Depression;

Epilepsy;

PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder); and

Schizophrenia, or schizophrenia spectrum disorders.\r


What is a mental health problem? A mental health problem is a mental health condition caused by a psychological disturbance that affects behavior or thought processes. This includes such things as a personality disorder, emotional dysregulation, mood instability, severe social impairment, impaired judgment, impulsivity, poor concentration, learning disabilities, cognitive and language deficits and abnormal thinking. The term ""mental health"" is also used to refer to any individual, family member, physician or nurse practitioner treating someone with a mental health problem. \r


How do I get diagnosed? \r


A general physical exam (examine yourself to make sure you're well) will determine if you have a mental health problem. However, it's important to note that some mental health problems may appear on your doctor's medical record but don't necessarily lead to a diagnosis. In addition, some patients can have multiple diagnoses. You should discuss this with your clinician or health care team.


You should talk with your primary care physician before starting treatment for a mental health issue. Many diseases and medications affect many different systems within your body. If you suspect that you may have a problem and want to explore whether you'll benefit from therapy, the American Psychiatric Association has published guidelines for evaluating and managing individuals with major depressive disorder. You can learn about","There are many, and some of them are more serious than others. But the general trend is that people with more severe mental disorders tend to have worse social skills. Social difficulties may include poor communication skills, difficulty finding jobs, difficulty managing money and debt, anxiety about interpersonal relationships, depression, and other mood-related issues. Many children and adults with major depression do not understand why they feel depressed or suicidal. They may think they're going crazy or ""crazy,"" but their symptoms don't seem like a natural part of who they are. They also may believe that something bad will happen if they don't get better quickly (such as losing all their friends). In addition, if you need help, your family could be afraid to ask you for it. If you are struggling with a mental illness such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or anxiety, there may be a higher chance that you'll end up in jail because your symptoms might make someone feel threatened or unsafe. Sometimes, even when medications are helpful, patients still may need help getting out of the hospital or treatment programs. For example, if a patient has been prescribed an antipsychotic drug but isn't taking it due to side effects, you may want to try switching to another medication, or asking that the person return to regular treatment. \r

What kinds of mental health problems affect me? \nA: While no two people experience the same types of mental health problems, there are several things that may cause you to struggle with one or both of these areas: \/\ One area is depression, which affects 1 percent to 2 percent of Americans at any given time. It's usually considered a temporary condition and can go away on its own over time. Some people who've had depression before have trouble with the way they think and behave, so they may become withdrawn, angry, aggressive, or depressed again later. Others may develop obsessive thoughts and feelings related to mental health conditions such as anxiety, panic attacks, phobias, and eating disorders. These symptoms may last long after the initial depressive episode passes, often affecting your ability to work, live independently, or form meaningful relationships. Depression may interfere with your ability to enjoy life, including caring for loved ones. Other common causes of depression include substance abuse and trauma. As you learn more about this topic, we hope you'll find more information about how the following can help improve your mental health, whether or not you suffer from any specific kind of mental health problem. \r

How does my mental health care provider know if","For young adults, depression is the second leading cause of disability among people ages 18 to 29. Suicide and self-harm represent more than 1/3 of all suicide deaths.\nA: Over half (55%) of Americans aged 12 or older have ever been diagnosed with a mental disorder. Some 20% say they've had two or more at any given time. The same percentage has never been in treatment for mental illness. \nA: Among men, 10% have ever been diagnosed with a mental disorder; 17% of women have. In recent years, the number of U.S. physicians who have seen psychiatric patients has grown from 3% to 4%. In 1991, only 10% had seen such patients. This number has since increased to 17%, and it will likely increase further as new technologies improve the accuracy of diagnosis. \nA: Depression is associated with many factors, but one common factor is poor quality sleep. Sleep deprivation increases the risk of major depressive episodes and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. People with sleep disorders often experience daytime drowsiness, anxiety, fatigue, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. Other potential causes include excessive alcohol use (including binge drinking), drug abuse, poor diet, and stress.\nA: According to the National Institute of Mental Health, 5 million Americans suffer from some type of substance abuse or dependence, about 2.5 percent of the population. Drug addiction is the third leading cause of death for individuals age 15-44, accounting for 16% of all suicides. \nA: Almost 8 out of every 100 Americans have used illicit drugs in their lifetime. Alcoholism is the second leading cause of morbidity and mortality among young adults under 25. The rate is 11 times higher among adults over 65. Alcohol poisoning is responsible for almost 400,000 emergency room visits each year. \nA: Most people who commit suicide are not seeking help from family and friends. Many others do not seek professional assistance. There is no evidence that medical marijuana helps. \nA: A growing body of research suggests that cannabis may be helpful in reducing feelings of sadness or anxiety. Studies indicate that daily use reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety by up to 60%. However, when cannabis is used chronically, its effects on mood deteriorate significantly.

Q: Why do employers need to investigate if an employee has a psychological problem (or has had one)? A: In general, a person's employment status does not affect his/her ability to obtain treatment for psychological issues. However, it is important to know whether an individual poses any threat to the company and to take steps to protect the safety of others. It is also critical to determine the reason behind the person's behavior, which may involve making changes in how he/she interacts with employees. For example, if someone is upset over losing a job, it would be inappropriate for you to inquire about the reasons why. Such inquiries could lead to further questions regarding your own personal life and possibly reveal a possible personal issue. Employers must follow all applicable laws and regulations to ensure safety at work. When there is a risk that you will suffer harm because of the presence of psychological disorders, or a personality disorder, it is a good idea to seek professional help from a licensed psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, or other qualified professional to evaluate the nature of your symptoms and determine whether you have a serious emotional or behavioral disorder. \r

Q: What kind of evidence do I require? How long does the investigation process last? A: An employer must make a formal decision to hire or discharge someone based on the results of a psychiatric evaluation within 30 days after receiving written notice of such termination. If you don't receive this notification before the end of the thirty-day period, you must notify us in writing no later than three business days prior to terminating employment. No formal decision may be made until all reasonable efforts to reach agreement have been exhausted. We ask for documentation of the initial request for an appointment, including a copy of the letter requesting an evaluation, as well as the name of the physician/psychiatrist who performed the evaluation and copies of medical records relevant to the diagnosis and treatment. Also included is a brief explanation of why we believe the condition was so severe that the job applicant posed a potential danger to the employer or others. Additionally, we want","People who live in poverty and have low levels of education tend to experience high rates of depression, anxiety, suicide attempts and substance abuse. Mental illness is also a significant public health issue, with one study estimating that more than 50% of Americans suffer from some type of mental disorder at any given time. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) estimates that about 25% of adults have an alcohol-use disorder (10 percent with an eating disorder), and 8–9% have a substance use disorder (8 percent with an emotional disorder). \r

As with any other chronic condition such as cancer, depression can become severe and debilitating over time, and it may even be irreversible. Many people struggle for years before they seek help for their condition. Others need professional treatment but do not get immediate results. In addition, many symptoms of mood disorders can be reversed through medication. \r

The NIMH recommends that people with serious mental illnesses receive professional treatment and follow up visits every 3 months to assess progress. Treatment often includes psychotherapy and medications to control the symptoms. \r

People with certain mental health conditions, especially those who require hospitalization for mental health care or psychiatric services such as counseling, intensive outpatient treatments or hospitalizations, should see their doctors regularly throughout life so they receive appropriate care. For example, someone with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia may benefit from regular medical evaluation, psychological testing and counseling, and behavioral therapy to keep them on track. If you believe you may be experiencing a depressive episode or a psychotic disorder, talk to your doctor about the best course of action. You might want to check out our article on ways to reduce stress in your daily life. \r

How Is Depression Different From Other Illnesses? A number of different factors contribute to the severity and impact of depression, including genetic predisposition, biological processes, environmental factors and lifestyle choices. For example, people who develop depression frequently report feeling sad or hopeless, having thoughts of death or harming self or others, feeling helpless or helpless. This kind of thinking seems to occur during times of intense stress, such as when jobs and relationships are difficult to maintain, or when finances become difficult. It has been suggested by some experts that depressed individuals may be less responsive to the social cues used to promote positive emotions like laughter and smiles, and that this may lead to their feelings of being ""stuck"" or ""down.""\r

People who take part in physical activity may find that they cannot function effectively if they feel down and sad.","These include depression, anxiety, phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The types of symptoms that may lead to these disorders vary from one individual to another. Symptoms may also be present in childhood, adolescence and adulthood. For example, some people with PTSD have flashbacks or nightmares after a traumatic event. It is important for you to get help if you experience any of the following at any time: thoughts about harming others

feeling anxious or depressed

being irritable or angry

having difficulty sleeping or staying asleep

trouble concentrating

feelings of worthlessness

unpredictability

feeling like you need to do something drastic to change your situation or circumstances

frequent changes in appetite or weight

an increased risk for heart attacks and strokes When deciding whether or not an action is necessary, it may be helpful to consider all of the possible consequences associated with taking the action. This includes your safety, as well as the potential effects on yourself and other people around you. If you are unsure whether or not certain actions will affect someone else, contact a trained counselor or mental health professional who can discuss your options with you in more detail. A list of resources where you may find information about preventing or managing some types of mental illnesses can be found here.","The most common psychological problems are anxiety, depression and stress. There is no single cause for any of these disorders. It is more common to have them in people who live alone than in couples. Anxiety and depression usually start out as benign symptoms before they become severe or life-threatening.\nOne method you may find helpful in treating your own anxiety is to watch television shows that tell stories about coping with difficult situations (such as those associated with mental illness). Other methods include going through a list of possible causes and following up with a therapist or counselor on what works best for you.\nAnother way to help yourself cope better with certain types of feelings is by practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, yoga, and even music. You might also try using medications prescribed by your doctor or psychiatrist, which can reduce your anxiety levels. If medication is not working, talk with your doctor if it feels like there is nothing else that will work. As long as you continue to take this medicine and do other things that helps alleviate your anxiety, your condition should improve over time.

Q: Is there anything that has helped me with my mental illness? A: Most things help. In fact, your life can be better after taking care of yourself mentally! Your body needs good food, exercise and sunshine. These things should be part of your daily routine. Take time for each of those things every day! Keep reading about how to get healthy through nutrition and exercise! Read on... Q: Can you give me more information on the type of psychiatric medications that I can take? Are they appropriate for me? A: Just because something works, doesn't mean it will work for everyone. Most medicines require approval from two different bodies before they go into production. Your doctor will tell you which ones are appropriate for you based on your specific medical situation. However, there are a few types of medications that can be used over and over again in your brain - and others that won't. These include: tranquilizers (like Xanax, Ambien, Klonopin, etc.)

sedatives (such as Valium)

anti depressants (like Klonopin, Ritalin, etc.)

antipsychotics (such as Prozac, Zyprexa, Seroquel, etc.)

prodrugs (such as Clozapine or Mellaril)

53,Q: what is psychotherapy?\nA:,"Psychotherapy, like any other form of therapy, is a process where we try to help people with problems or stresses and emotions. This includes helping them discover their deepest emotional needs. It also helps them learn how to manage those needs so that they may feel better in the long run. Some of these include learning new skills, building relationships with others, improving self-esteem and confidence, increasing life satisfaction, making changes in life, and reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Q: Why would someone consider having treatment for mental health issues?\nA: There are many reasons for this - as well as the fact that it's often much cheaper than using traditional medical treatments, such as prescription drugs, which can be expensive. Also, because it focuses on helping people develop healthy ways of thinking about themselves and the world, rather than treating specific illness or disorders, it tends to focus more on finding solutions to problems instead of just 'fixing' the problem at hand (which is usually unsuccessful). It's also much easier to get involved in - you don't have to find a counsellor who has an actual training in psychology or psychiatry or even a doctor in your area to refer you to a therapist. Q: What is psychodynamic psychotherapies like?\nA: These are therapies aimed at addressing deeper aspects of our inner lives. They're based on beliefs and attitudes held by our ancestors and family members from the past, which may not always reflect our current views. For instance, a person may believe that all pain is caused by bad karma (e.g., bad thoughts), but then decide that some of her own experiences and feelings were just part of life's ups and downs. Similarly, a person may feel very sad after a recent bereavement but think she feels great now, yet later say that she's still feeling down and depressed. In addition, a person may hold different values from those held by society and from his parents/teachers. That doesn't mean he'll necessarily become ""better"" if he goes through the same thing again, but will simply bring out new values of his own. The most effective way to deal with these issues is to come up with alternative perspectives. So, for example, if someone believes that all good things happen because of God, he might start working towards becoming a Christian priest, since it's believed to be something everyone should do. Another approach involves understanding the causes of our problems and trying to change them before they cause us harm or damage ourselves or others. Q: Are there any","A therapy that helps people live with and understand their emotions. Psychotherapy involves helping the person cope with feelings, thoughts and behaviors by changing them, using positive reinforcement techniques, and talking about difficult issues. Some of these may include:

Relaxing and focusing on the present moment

Embracing your strengths rather than suppressing your weaknesses

Learning to accept yourself as you are and learn to value yourself for who you really are

Treating problems in a constructive manner rather than blaming others or trying to fix things at your own expense

Finding ways to let go of anger and hurtful feelings

Recognizing when something triggers painful memories

Getting help from others if necessary

Having someone else (usually a parent, spouse, friend) come into your life to support you through times of difficulty

Knowing how to manage feelings safely and appropriately

Understanding how to use different coping skills (e.g., self-care, relaxation, sleep, exercise, etc.) and what they mean in everyday life

In addition to providing emotional support, therapy can also help prevent symptoms of depression, such as low moods, anxiety, insomnia, loss of interest in activities, lack of energy, poor concentration, and so forth. The treatment process uses lots of cognitive behavioral strategies and a variety of behavioral interventions. For example, CBT can be used to teach people to:


Understand their feelings

Know which emotions are most important and why

Learn new skills to deal with stressful situations

Identify unhealthy habits such as drinking excessively, smoking, overusing certain medications, overeating, being too hard on themselves, or avoiding social events

Develop healthier eating habits and reduce stress

Plan ahead, and stick to it

Think carefully before doing anything that might trigger an emotion

Create healthy routines that keep you happy

Find ways to give and receive positive feedback and encouragement

Use tools to overcome resistance to change or challenge your beliefs

Participate in peer groups or other supportive environments.

Therapists work with clients through group sessions, individual therapy, telephone calls and letters, and online counseling. They sometimes conduct in-person sessions as well as telephone consultations with client family members, friends, and even doctors. Many therapists specialize in particular areas, including:


Family therapy, which focuses on relationships between parents and children, as well as parenting behavior

Interpersonal dynamics, including relationship dynamics between spouses and partners, children and siblings

Psychodynamic","It's a way to help people get better. You can do it at home, in your own room or even in the hospital. Psychotherapy helps you learn about yourself and how you've been feeling, so that when you come out of therapy, you feel more comfortable and are able to take your health back into your hands."" \r

""Psychology can be used for everything from making friends with someone who has difficulty seeing themselves as others see them (like a person whose parents think they're fat) to treating someone who may have a serious disease like cancer,"" says Dr. Michael Lescroart, PsyD, a registered psychologist who specializes in psychopharmacological treatments. \r

""In psychotherapy, there isn't really any one question that gets answered, just more questions: ""What am I afraid of?"" ""Is there something wrong with me?"" ""How do I know if this anxiety or depression is going away?"" ""What should I focus on next?"" ""Can I work through my past trauma?"" That kind of thing,"" he adds. \r

""You can talk to someone without getting upset or angry because you don't want to hurt their feelings and they won't hurt yours. For example, if you're fearful of talking to somebody else who seems confused or uncomfortable, try saying, 'I'll tell you how I feel.' This makes them feel less defensive by telling them what they need to hear, and you can go ahead anyway. They will find out what they want to hear rather than what they fear hearing,"" explains Dr. Lescroart. \r

""If you are having trouble coping with stress, you might consider trying to use relaxation techniques such as yoga or meditation. There are also some medications that can help reduce or prevent stress. Some antidepressants are available over-the-counter, but other medications require a prescription from a doctor,"" he continues. \r

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy \r

""Your therapist will ask questions like 'what happened?' and 'why didn't we stop him?' The goal is to understand why things happen the way they did,"" says Dr. Lescroart. If you feel anxious all the time, you probably haven't done enough self-talk, which will likely involve repetitive thoughts and phrases. \r

The best thing you can do is start practicing some simple mental exercises. These range from basic cognitive tasks—such as remembering letters, numbers, or names—to more complex ones such as thinking logically about","A form of therapy that helps the patient cope with a life crisis. It can help with issues such as depression, anxiety, self-esteem problems and relationships. Psychotherapy has different forms to suit your needs. Some therapists will use psychoanalysis in their treatments or other types of counselling as an adjunct for the treatment itself. Other methods include cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, interpersonal skills training and talk therapy. Q: is there a difference between psychotherapy and psychoanalysis?

A: There are several differences between these two methods. One important factor is that psychotherapy focuses on the individual's emotions rather than the way they feel about themselves and others. Another important distinction is that psychotherapists typically treat patients who need some degree of psychological support at any stage in their lives. Psychotherapy often involves both therapy sessions and individual therapy sessions, whereas most psychotherapists treat only patients during regular treatment sessions. This means that psychotherapy does not necessarily have to be 'counselling' – it may involve talking about feelings and thoughts without trying to change them. In contrast, many people prefer to talk more openly about emotional issues in therapy sessions than in ordinary times. The main difference lies in the focus of therapy, which usually centres around helping you develop new coping strategies and new ways of relating to yourself and others. It is possible to combine these approaches when needed. Q: how do I find a therapist?

A: For those seeking help via psychotherapy or counsellors (or both) the best place to start looking is www.mentalhealth.govt.nz, where various government agencies offer advice, checklists and links to other organisations that provide information. You might also try contacting the local Mental Health Board. Alternatively you could try one of the numerous websites that offer online counselling or counselling services; see the list at the bottom of this page. If you cannot find anything, you should contact the nearest health care provider - even if it's just an email address. Q: will my doctor diagnose me with something and prescribe me drugs?

A: No. Doctors diagnosis disorders using the standard criteria used by mental health professionals in the UK and elsewhere. However, there is a difference between diagnosing something based on symptoms alone, and diagnosing something based on a history of events (such as what was going on in someone else's life). Diagnosis is a medical process, rather than a mental health one. Q: don't doctors diagnose all conditions and illnesses automatically?

A: Yes. Many","""Psychology"" means the study of human behavior in social relationships, such as family, work or school. The word has a long history with English, having been used to describe the science of how we understand ourselves and others through observation and experience. It's no longer used by most dictionaries though, so I thought I'd use it here instead. This website was started for my sister. She was diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 12, but her symptoms were hard to detect because she'd been diagnosed early, when they weren't considered normal (a lot easier than diagnosing children). This site is designed to help you see your daughter as a person who might be struggling, rather than as an example of what mental illness looks like. There are links to articles about her and some links to other people with similar issues and also some support groups.

What should I expect from psychotherapy?\nA: Psychotherapy often involves helping a patient learn strategies that will help them cope with their feelings, thoughts and behaviors. Some patients may have problems with certain types of therapy; this does not mean there isn't anything else you can do for them. Just remember that you should always seek out good therapy, especially if you think it could benefit your child. For many parents, finding the right therapist can seem like a daunting task, but once you get started and get involved in learning the tools and techniques, things start to feel much more fun! Sometimes treatment works best when you're talking it over with the client first before making changes, and sometimes a change needs to happen immediately after your initial consultation. So make sure to go back several times and take notes on what you find useful and avoid giving advice based off assumptions or biased opinions. When making decisions regarding therapy, you'll want to ask yourself whether you can do something differently, not whether you think it would be better to just try something new. Also, keep in mind that any kind of therapy works well for some, some less so. Keep that in mind while deciding what type of therapeutic relationship to build with your child.","it is a treatment that works by changing the way the brain and body react to thoughts, feelings and events. It's based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT is generally regarded as having helped hundreds of thousands of people worldwide - from the UK to South Africa. But there are many other forms of therapy which have been developed in recent years, and they differ in how effective they may be at treating specific types of depression and anxiety disorders. For example, there are mindfulness-based therapies that work with the mind rather than the emotions, whereas others offer more immediate relief but don't involve any sort of learning or skills.

But if you're not happy in life then you'll probably need some help for whatever reason, and so I'm here to tell you about one method of dealing with your problems and to let you know when and where to find out more. I can guarantee that if this sounds useful to you, I will get back to you within 48 hours!\nThe basic idea behind self-help groups is fairly straightforward, and involves getting together with like-minded individuals who share common interests and concerns. There is no pressure to go along or anything. As well as talking about your worries and needs, you can also discuss things such as personal growth, financial issues, relationships, family problems and mental health challenges. It is often quite easy to find someone who shares your interest in the subject, as long as they are available and willing to talk about their own experiences with depression or anxiety. \nIf there is anyone else you would like me to introduce you to, please do call me up. There are also several online forums devoted to depression and anxiety management and recovery which you might want to take a look at. I also recommend www.selfhappiness.co.uk as well as the books listed below, written by very successful people who have successfully overcome both physical and psychological problems that affect their lives.

What we will cover today: The different ways to deal with depression and anxiety

How to seek help if you already have depression or anxiety symptoms

Some helpful websites and resources for helping yourself cope with depression and anxiety

Why does it happen? Depression and anxiety usually start because something has happened in your life that makes you unhappy. This could include a break down in your relationship, a job loss or even just being unable to put into words how you feel. If your depression or anxiety isn't dealt with immediately, then you risk developing additional difficulties later down the line. So the first step in","therapy is a social process in which a person tries to understand, understand and live with the emotions of others. It is usually done on a person-to-person basis or through groups of people.\r

\r

In some cases, people are given help from a therapist, but it's not a ""session"" where they're asked questions about their problems. Sometimes it's referred to as ""talking therapies.""\r


\r

What do we mean when we say that you don't have to be perfect to make it?\r


\r

Psychotherapy focuses on helping people learn how to cope with their feelings better so they can function more effectively in everyday life. People who have been abused may need support to develop coping strategies for dealing with emotional difficulties. For instance, if someone has been abused by an older sibling or parent, they might find learning how to express themselves without being overwhelmed helps them manage their anger.\r


\r

How does it work?\r


\r

Most therapies involve either one session or two sessions of personal interviews. In some, you meet other people who also have suffered abuse and then you talk together about your experience and the types of techniques used at home or in therapy. You share your experience with those you'll discuss it with during the course of treatment. In many cases, you will get a chance to share your story with someone else.\r


\r

We use the following techniques to help you learn what works best for you. We recommend getting some sort of assistance. Some therapists charge for this type of care. Others provide free services, including telephone consultations and online webinars, or charge a fee. Read more about each technique.\r","(1) A form of treatment that aims to change a patient's behavior by changing his or her beliefs, thoughts and feelings. Psychotherapy may include, but is not limited to, the following methods: (a) The application of techniques, such as the use of hypnosis, guided imagery, and cognitive behavioral therapy, to change a person's beliefs about self, relationships with others, or reality; (b) Providing specific skills training for therapists who work in the area of psychoeducation and counseling; (c) The development of individualized education plans which aim at teaching people how to behave differently so they can feel more relaxed, safe, and successful when interacting with other people and their environments; and (d) Developing educational programs designed specifically for students suffering from psychological disorders, including those who are children and adolescents. \r

2: What should you tell your child if he/she complains of nightmares after having received the medication?\nA: The most important thing is to take good care of your child and keep him/her well informed. Tell your child whenever possible that nightmares do occur sometimes and that this is normal. You should also be sure to talk to your child's physician regarding any medications that have been prescribed to treat his/her condition. In many cases, there may not be an appropriate time to discuss the issue with your child. Please contact us immediately if your child experiences nightmares after receiving the medication because we will work closely together with you to help address any concerns. We encourage you to continue getting regular check-ups with your child if necessary. If you need further information please call us toll free at 1-800-852-5234 or send email to psychopharmacy@medscommissioner.org. You can also view our Consumer Alert on Nightmare and Other Nightmares at www.medscommissioner.org/safetyalerts/pdf/NRL%20Announcement_Nightmares.pdf. \r

3: Does psychotherapy help your child with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)?\nA: Yes! Most patients diagnosed with PTSD undergo two types of therapeutic approaches. First, some of these individuals receive treatments designed to help them cope with symptoms of PTSD. This type of therapy includes individual, group, family, and social support groups. Second, there are some individuals who get psychological therapy to deal with PTSD symptoms without a therapist present. These therapies may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT),","a form of social support. It can be very helpful to you and your children if it is used in your own life. It helps to build up trust, confidence and self-esteem. If you have been through the mental health system before then you are likely familiar with some of these terms. You may also know that they are not used very often in this context as they tend to make people feel guilty about their mistakes or bad experiences. Psychotherapy can help you to gain perspective on your situation so you can do things differently next time.

(3)What is a ""Psycho"" therapist?\nA: A psycho therapist is someone who has trained by practising different therapies. This means that he/she has had to work hard to develop his skills. Some examples are counsellors, medical professionals and psychologists but most therapists use techniques such as hypnosis, mindfulness meditation, cognitive behaviour therapy, interpersonal therapy (IEPs), role play and other techniques that enable them to learn from their clients' problems and improve their ability to deal effectively with them.


It is important for you to consider whether you wish to get professional help from any one of the many people offering psychological services. The key is to determine which approach works best for you, how long it will take you to complete and the cost associated with each treatment plan.

(4)How can I find out more about my options?

You should call your GP first to check if there is a specialised program that would suit you well. Once you have made an appointment with your psychologist, you may want to visit the clinic where you have been referred. You may also contact the specialist programs listed below.

(5)Do I need to pay anything to see a psychologist?

Yes. There are several fees involved in providing counselling services, including costs for equipment and supplies, and even for setting up sessions. In addition, some programs charge for the time spent by members of staff working together at all stages of the process.

For example, if you receive counselling only from 2 psychologists, then the total cost for counselling services provided would include:

2 sessions – £20 per session (£1 per hour);

2 days of training – £35 (depending on the type of programme); and

£100 (for private sessions).

When considering paying for counselling services from one of these programs, remember that they vary considerably in cost. Therefore, you should try to compare different rates and prices before committing to","a therapeutic intervention which aims to restore or improve the emotional and psychological functioning of people suffering from mental disorders. In other words, it involves treating the patients' problems with positive rather than negative methods. Psychotherapists have no interest in the individual patient's behavior, but are interested in helping him recover his sense of self and regain the capacity for feeling compassion and empathy. They may also help him gain new insight into his own needs, needs that he does not now know.\r

54,Q: What does multiple sclerosis diagnosis include? What does it change?\nA:,"Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks itself. It causes inflammation of a part of your brain called the spinal cord, and also can affect other parts of your body, such as muscles or nerves. The most common type of MS is relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). You may have either primary MS (primary progressive MS) or secondary MS (secondary progressive MS), but both types are not usually diagnosed together because they're treated differently. For more information about how to diagnose multiple sclerosis, read ""How Is Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosed?""

What is the treatment for MS?\nA: There's no cure for MS; you need to take medication. Some people with MS use medicines called steroids. Other people just live with their illness and don't get any help from medications at all. Read more about managing MS symptoms and treatments.

Can I get pregnant after having MS?\nA: No. However, if you have high levels of certain hormones, including progesterone, the condition known as amenorrhea can develop. If this happens during pregnancy, contact your doctor right away so that he/she can perform testing to make sure there aren't complications. Also, ask your doctor about getting tested for HIV. You could be exposed to HIV through blood transfusion or sex during pregnancy. If HIV is detected while you're pregnant, it doesn't mean you should stop taking medications to treat your MS. It only means you should try to avoid risky sexual practices until you've had several prenatal visits. For more information, see our page on STDs.","Multiple sclerosis is a disease in which the immune system destroys nerve cells called myelin sheaths.\r

The damage to the myelin sheaths prevents signals from electrical impulses from reaching neurons in your brain, causing symptoms such as loss of memory and confusion, numbness or tingling in one hand, trouble walking, muscle spasms and difficulty swallowing.\r

MS affects an estimated 1 million Americans, primarily people over age 50. It can be treated successfully with medications that block abnormal protein production in nerves. MS treatment includes several different types of therapy including daily injections of steroids, which may help reduce pain and fatigue but do not usually slow down or reverse the progression of the disease. The use of immunosuppressive drugs can also slow down the progress of the disease. This type of treatment has been effective for many years, especially if used early on in the course of disease. However, some older patients have failed to respond well to immunosuppressant drugs because they did not meet criteria for an ""optimal response"" to this medication. In cases where MS leads to progressive disability, doctors are required by law to keep track of MS activity. Doctors must record all neurological, musculoskeletal and other complications related to the disease along with their age at onset. If you have MS and have an accurate, current medical history, the doctor who diagnosed you will most likely ask about this information. You'll need to provide answers to specific questions regarding your health and lifestyle prior to receiving any prescription drug. Your healthcare provider will probably want to know how long you've had MS, what's changed in your life since you first got sick, your physical condition, family history of MS (including past illnesses), whether you're pregnant or plan to become pregnant and when you last took medication for your MS. Other tests that may be done include blood tests to check for infection (such as tuberculosis) or bacterial infections, blood tests to detect certain cancers, liver function tests and a urine test to look for substances that could indicate kidney problems. There are many medical conditions that don't cause the same kind of serious disability as MS, so they can usually be managed without surgery and are generally covered under Medicare or Medicaid. Some conditions, however, can make it difficult to find out whether you might benefit from getting screened for these diseases. For example, HIV/AIDS (a sexually transmitted disease) can affect several parts of the body, including the brain. So although screening for HIV can prevent HIV transmission from sexual partners to sex workers, it","It changes because of the disease process itself. MS is an autoimmune disorder, meaning it's not just one thing that you have to get rid of or something that requires medication. In addition, it's also caused by a protein called TNF-α, which is produced by white blood cells and plays a role in inflammation (inflammation) in your body. That protein is part of the immune system. When you are exposed to high levels of this protein in your environment, it can make your skin and joints more vulnerable. It may also affect your ability to breathe. \r

A person with MS has progressive loss of nerve fibers throughout their bodies, resulting in weakness and numbness. As the number of nerves decrease, muscle function declines. The symptoms of MS typically appear at various stages of the disease, but people who live with MS for long periods experience them gradually. Some people develop full-blown MS without ever having symptoms, and others have only mild symptoms. People with MS have different ways of getting relief from the fatigue, pain, stiffness, joint or muscle aches, numbness and other sensations they feel as a result of the illness. For example, some people take a drug called interferon beta that suppresses production of TNF-α. Others use anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen or naproxen to reduce swelling, soreness, and stiffness. \r

Some people also try to manage MS by keeping it under control. They wear a special kind of glove over their hands when working outside or around machinery that might trigger a flare up. Or they use a computer program called IMSI (immunotherapy using ImmunoTherapy Interleukin I), which takes advantage of what the body produces during a flare up. Other people use pills called immunosuppressants to help prevent relapses. These medications work by preventing the body from releasing new proteins into the bloodstream that cause inflammation. However, some people still need to take these medicines every day -- if they don't do so they could risk worsening symptoms. People with MS often find themselves trying to stay away from certain foods or beverages while managing their condition, even though eating those items isn't considered harmful for most people. Some people also struggle to drink large amounts of water. Some doctors recommend going easy on the insulin that is prescribed to treat diabetes, though many others say that can be beneficial to their health too. The side effects associated with these treatments vary based on your situation. If your doctor recommends a treatment, he or she","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and progressive neurological disorder that affects the brain, spinal cord, muscles and nerves. It has no cure or treatment. The disease can cause pain in different parts of the body, such as arms, legs or feet; loss of feeling in some areas; numbness and tingling in others. People with MS often have other health problems, including high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, kidney problems, vision problems, hearing problems and mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. They may also be at higher risk for developing certain cancers and conditions like Alzheimer's. What do you need to know now? This information is based on the latest research from Mayo Clinic.

What are the signs and symptoms of MS?

The most common sign of MS is an abnormal white spot called an aura. An aura means that something looks out of place or out of focus. You might feel like your eyes fill up or your face seems to glow. Sometimes it feels as if there are two lights, one light above and another below your head. Your body temperature can drop suddenly, and when this happens, it can make it hard to sleep. Other times it can feel like someone is staring directly into your eyes. If you have any of these symptoms and get over them quickly, you're probably not going to develop MS. There are many symptoms related to MS, but here are some important ones. An aura Auras arise from changes in the way your nervous system works. Some people see things more clearly than others. Others notice things less clearly. For example, if you are reading a book and start seeing images or patterns in a picture that normally would be seen by just about everyone else, you could say that your visual sense is better than usual because you've developed better eyesight. Auras can be caused by a variety of factors, such as the following: A stroke, injury, surgery, infections, drugs or medicines, a seizure or medication side effects, stress, anxiety, depression and medications. These triggers can affect how your mind interprets what you're seeing. You won't always notice new or unexpected visual images. For example, when your eye is working fine but you notice objects that aren't usually visible, it's not uncommon for you to see things that seem blurry. Some other examples of an Aura include: Seeing ""spots"" in pictures.

Seeing images that appear in a blur or haze.

Being able to read a newspaper or magazine without difficulty. Sometimes an aura will","Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system in which abnormal cell growth and inflammation are responsible for damage to the nerves. The most common signs or symptoms of multiple sclerosis can be divided into two main categories: 1) pain-related (such as swelling, muscle weakness, tingling), 2) fatigue-related (such as difficulty with concentration). Pain, muscle stiffness and tiredness may occur on its own or after other conditions such as infections or fractures. However, both kinds of symptoms are also present if there is damage to the nerve cells.\nA: As described above, multiple sclerosis affects about 0.5% to 5% of the population. It is estimated that this number will rise significantly by 2020. According to the latest report from the World Health Organization (WHO), there were an estimated 3 million people living with MS worldwide at the beginning of 2015. That's up from an estimated 300,000 in 2006; however, it could be much higher. In addition, the numbers of people diagnosed with MS vary widely across countries. For example, South Korea has one of the highest rates of all developed nations. There have been reports of patients being treated with immunosuppressants that cause increased risk for death. However, research shows that these drugs do not increase the risk of death in the long run and actually reduce disability.\nB: Multiple sclerosis causes severe disability due to an immune system attack against the nerves and brain. Patients usually experience significant cognitive difficulties as well. They often need frequent trips to the doctor because their lives become very difficult. Often the person suffers from constant pain. Because MS develops gradually over years, treatment is limited to controlling symptoms and preventing further damage to the nerves. Even though patients' overall quality of life improves, patients may still require ongoing care. In fact, many studies show that MS patients must remain healthy, even when they get older, in order for the condition to improve. Therefore, it makes sense for doctors to try to prevent future complications so that no one is left without access to healthcare. Additionally, MS requires treatment with anti-inflammatory medications. In some cases, these medicines may help control the inflammation and give the body time to recover. In contrast, more expensive medical devices like artificial joints or wheelchairs aren't effective in the long term because they don't allow the body enough time to heal itself.\nC: People who develop MS can be divided into three subtypes based on how quickly the disease progresses. There are: Type I - first episodes (≤3 months","Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system and spinal cord. It's also called Lou Gehrig's Disease, or motor neuron disease. The brain sends messages to your muscles to move your arms and legs, but sometimes those signals don't get through. That causes you to have numbness in one arm or leg. Sometimes you can feel pain when moving your body. If you have MS, you'll be diagnosed with MS at a young age, usually between 20 and 25 years old. After diagnosis, you may be treated by doctors for symptoms like: fatigue

muscle weakness

sensitivity to light, sound, touch and temperature

dizziness

nightmares

memory loss

fatigue

difficulty swallowing or breathing

poor vision

weakness of the face, neck, hands or feet When someone has MS, they often need more frequent medical care than people without the disease. This includes regular visits to their doctor (physician) because there are other factors affecting how well your immune system responds to medication. For example, if you have a high number of T-cells, then those cells will attack your MS cells. And if you're taking medications like an antihistamine (like Benadryl), you might not be able to protect your body against infection very well.","It means that a person has MS for at least six months. There are many different types of MS, and each one is diagnosed by the doctor who first diagnoses it. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic progressive disease. At any given time, there are about 100 people in the United States living with MS.\nA: The most common symptoms of MS are: fatigue (fatigue), muscle pain (muscle pain), joint stiffness or numbness (joint stiffness or numbness), and vision problems (visual acuity problems). Each month, about 1/4-1/2 million Americans have some form of serious disability. In addition to these severe, disabling conditions, other related disorders may cause other symptoms such as headaches, confusion, loss of memory, eye problems, skin problems, and hearing problems. These other forms of disability can make life very difficult. When you're diagnosed with MS, your condition goes from being relatively mild to extremely debilitating. But treatment is the key to managing it successfully. You will need to learn to take good care of yourself and to manage your body so you don't develop more debilitating diseases later on. Your doctor may recommend physical therapy to help improve posture and balance, medication, dietary changes, and lifestyle changes (e.g., exercise). If necessary, you might also try certain drugs. Most treatments work only temporarily. You'll probably continue taking these medications until your disease is under control, though they might not be enough if your condition gets worse and your medications aren't working well. As you progress toward full recovery from your disorder, you can choose to stop taking certain medicines or start them again from scratch. With proper management of your health, you should have little or no difficulty getting back into normal activities after you recover from your MS. People who live with MS tend to develop an increased risk of complications like heart attack or stroke. Some people with MS may still have significant cognitive impairment when they get older. How long you stay in the hospital depends largely on how seriously your disease is progressing. If you have a fever, your doctor may put you on antibiotics immediately to keep the infection from spreading. If you feel better within several days, your doctor may move you onto another type of antibiotic. However, if your illness keeps going along with the current antibiotic regimen, your doctor may decide to switch you to a newer drug. This could involve changing your dose, switching to a different brand name (such as azithromycin) or even starting a new course of treatment that's harder on your immune system. Sometimes patients","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a condition characterized by an autoimmune disease that damages the brain and spinal cord. It is usually diagnosed after a person has had one or more of several symptoms, such as fatigue, numbness in the hands, feet, or mouth, vision problems, difficulty speaking, and seizures.\n\nThe main way to diagnose MS is with MRI scans. The images from these scans are used to determine if someone's nerve cells have been damaged. This can be done through X-rays, which look at how much damage occurs. If there is damage to the nerves, this indicates a loss of myelin, the insulation material that covers neurons, which affects their function. People who experience changes in eye sight may also get an abnormal amount of light coming into their eyes. For example, you might see spots on the retina where the light normally goes. In some people, however, there is no evidence of any damage to their optic nerves. However, the disorder may affect the visual field in other ways, causing blurred vision or seeing only part of things. Some people don't notice any noticeable difference between what they are doing now and what they were doing when they first started having symptoms. Other people report having the same or better vision than before, but no improvement. So, they're still able to perform everyday tasks. As they age, some people get better or worse. In the case of MS, some people do not develop signs or symptoms until years later, while others start showing symptoms immediately after the onset. \nIf the person takes medications to treat their MS, it makes sense to consider whether that medication would interfere with the ability to work or learn.\nSome people say that taking certain anti-inflammatory drugs may increase the risk of developing MS; however, the benefits outweigh any potential side effects.\n\nPeople with MS often suffer from limitations in walking, strength, coordination, and balance, as well as memory issues and mental confusion. They sometimes go out of their minds, become confused, lose touch with reality, and feel like they're just a little bit off. Many people with MS have trouble making decisions about money, relationships, education, sex, and employment because they feel disconnected from reality. Often, people with MS are embarrassed about having MS because they think everyone else has it too. Because it's so common, many people believe there isn't anything they can do. At the same time, many people have difficulties coping with daily life because they can't stop thinking about their disability and cannot","Multiple Sclerosis is a disorder of the nervous system. It affects about 300,000 Americans and is caused by an abnormal protein called the myelin sheath that covers nerve cells in your brain and spinal cord. The disease usually starts at age 25 or 26, after which you may experience symptoms for as long as 20 years. You don't know what's wrong until something changes in your body. For example, if you have high blood pressure, you might develop chronic pain, headaches, fatigue or joint problems, while some people with MS can also feel numbness around their eyes and ears, and other signs and symptoms are rare. In fact, in 2010, only one-third of adults over 65 had been diagnosed with MS. But new diagnoses have increased dramatically since 2000, and in 2012 there were more than 2.4 million Americans living with MS. Some doctors think this increase reflects improvements in diagnosing the condition, but others say new treatments and tests such as MRIs and PET scans are making MS much easier to diagnose. People who do not respond to medications or surgery are often referred to neurologists, who specialize in treating the disease. (More on Time.com: 10 Things You Didn't Know About Alzheimer's)

RELATED: New Study Reveals Why Women Are Twice As Likely To Get Diabetes","Multiple sclerosis is a chronic disease that affects the central nervous system. It causes many symptoms and can be progressive, which means that it gets worse over time. This condition cannot be cured and treatment is based on managing symptoms. There are four main categories of MS: auto-immune (also called auto-inflammatory), non-auto-immune (also called auto-proliferative), autoimmune and chronic, which can all result in the same symptoms. Each has its own specific set of treatments and may even differ between individuals. There are other conditions related to the immune system, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). You also have an increased risk for developing cancer (which can cause more inflammation) and certain types of heart disease or stroke. In addition, there are some genetic factors involved with MS. For more information, please read our summary article about MS. \nA: The disease begins when cells in your brain become inflamed and then they start damaging your nerves by sending out messages that tell them to stop functioning. \nB: Your body's natural defense mechanisms break down these signals, allowing the damaged parts of your brain to grow back. This process continues until you develop the signs and symptoms of MS.

How often do I need regular medical checkups? When did you know your doctor? \Nb: We don't like surprises during a routine physical, so it is important to get checked regularly. If you've been diagnosed with another chronic illness, you should also see your primary care provider for check ups, especially if your first visit was not quite right. As with any health issue, getting proper help from family, friends and caregivers will keep you healthy.\nC: Even though we want every person to stay healthy, a well-managed health plan will make sure that you are able to manage your health issues. Find out what plans provide best coverage, how long it will last and whether you'll need help paying for their costs.

What medicines can I take after surgery? How much medicine is needed? How can this affect my insurance rates? \nD: Generally speaking, you may use up to 2 milligrams of the medication used within 24 hours following your surgery, according to guidelines from the American College of Physicians. However, you may have to follow the physician's prescription requirements, depending on the type of surgery performed. Once you're medically cleared, you may choose to continue using the medications while you wait to find out what happens next. Some medicines may"
55,Q: How to manage multiple sclerosis?\nA:,"There are a number of methods. For one, you can try and identify the best therapies for your particular condition (including MS), then decide which would be most appropriate and appropriate to follow. If treatment is not working, you could use medication to reduce symptoms or other techniques. The same approach applies if there's no other treatment option available. And, again, remember that any therapy will help some people with MS, but it may also cause side effects. Many medications have been shown in studies to cause significant adverse reactions and even death in patients who take them for long periods of time, so carefully consider whether the benefits outweigh the risks. Also, there are many medical conditions that can lead to serious problems with the immune system; therefore, there are a variety of vaccines available to protect against these diseases.

Q: Is there anything else I should know about my illness?\nA: When someone has MS, they often experience worsening of their health over time, especially as their body continues to lose its ability to regulate itself and fight infections. This is known as autoimmunity, an autoimmune disease that occurs when healthy cells attack and destroy the healthy ones around them. Autoimmune disorders such as MS can last years before starting to improve. So you might feel like everything just seems OK until one day everything changes completely -- or worse. It's important to keep up to date on what's happening and to get regular tests to see if your progress is slowing down. Remember to always stay out of bed if you've had pain or fever for more than four weeks. And remember that being in remission isn't permanent. Some people go back into a chronic state once their disease has gone into remission, but this usually only lasts for several months. Be sure to talk to your doctor and your family members regularly about your status and your progress.","There are a variety of strategies, including medications and physical therapy. For those who have symptoms that prevent them from working or learning well, the best way is to try using computer programs that help people with MS control their movements. Many of these programs use video games as a substitute for tasks. Others include exercise and movement training. However, it's important to make sure you're doing everything you can to maintain good health while managing your disease. See our page on managing multiple sclerosis.

Q: I'm taking medication to treat my pain. Is there any reason we should stop taking this medicine? \nA: Doctors don't recommend stopping all medications because they might lead to complications or side effects. If you continue to take medication for chronic conditions such as MS, talk with your doctor about how you may need to change your dose or adjust the timing. A recent study found that although many drugs used to treat chronic illnesses also affect blood pressure, no other drug has been shown to cause a significant rise in blood pressure above normal levels without raising the risk of heart attacks and strokes. It's not clear why some medicines are more effective than others when taken in combination. Some medications used for treating MS increase the risk of blood clots and stroke by making people more vulnerable to heart attack and stroke.

Q: Can I keep taking the same anti-viral medicine during treatment for my MS? What if I get sick after being prescribed an anti-viral medication? \nA: Yes. People can take anti-virals for up to five years before becoming too ill to benefit from the treatment. They can be started at lower doses (e.g., 1 mg) before you become very ill. If you do start treatment with an HIV/AIDS medication, you must continue taking it until you've had two full months without signs or symptoms of infection. You must follow the instructions carefully in order to avoid serious harm. Read more about stopping and starting antiretrovirals.

Q: When am I supposed to see my doctor about my current flare-ups? Should I call ahead to let her know what's going on?\nA: Your doctor will tell you when she thinks it's time to schedule a visit so that you won't feel rushed into seeing your doctor. This could be just before your next headache or even weeks before your next relapse. And you probably want to plan your visit out thoroughly -- make appointments for tests, follow-up appointments, and follow-up phone calls. Check the American","It is a disease where symptoms are severe enough that you will have to go into physical therapy or medication. You may be able to get some relief from medication, but the worst part for MS sufferers is finding someone who can help you as you experience these symptoms and they don't know how to deal with them. Your doctor may recommend that you see a therapist. A lot of people find it hard to tell others about their condition because of social stigma associated with MS. However, if you feel comfortable talking about this, ask your health care provider what helps you cope when MS affects everyday life.

Q: Can I still work while having MS?

A: Yes, although there is not much research on whether working with MS affects people's ability to do so. Some studies suggest that patients working at home for long periods of time can develop serious problems such as vision impairment and hearing loss. If you want to continue your career, keep in mind that you'll need to take breaks during which you won't be able to work. Also, consider moving to another location. Moving could make it harder to stay active.

Q: How do I become more aware of my MS symptoms?

A: You should talk to your doctor about ways to increase awareness and understanding of your disease. Talk to your caregiver, friends, family members, coworkers, etc. to build trust and understand one another better. When you get out of bed, walk around town and be active, you'll notice subtle changes in your body. Be sure to keep an eye out for the signs and symptoms of MS such as fatigue, weakness, blurred vision, muscle pain, numbness and tingling (reduced sensation).

Q: What's the best way to manage my disability?

A: As much as possible, try to avoid activities that involve using your hands or feet. Many people suffer from cognitive decline when left too long without assistance and there are many alternatives for helping you with daily tasks. For example, take walks in parks, play sports, use wheelchairs, watch movies on DVD player or participate in other forms of leisure activity. The key thing is that each person takes responsibility for taking care of themselves and doing things that improve their quality of life and reduce their burden on others.","There is no single treatment that will solve all of the MS symptoms, but there are some things you can do. For instance, keep a close watch on your immune system. You have about 12-15 different kinds of autoimmune disease and if you don't get it under control then they could go from being manageable to life threatening. Other than that, I am sure everyone has heard about the common cold, how it's caused by your body making too many antibodies in response to viruses, bacteria etc. This is also an issue with MS. Try to avoid having sex or getting food at certain times when you may be more sensitive to the virus. Also make sure to clean up after yourself as often as possible. The only thing you should not do is take any kind of medication during this time. A number of people report having been diagnosed with MS who were never actually sick. They had just taken the wrong drug and became ill. When you think about it, this makes sense. It appears that the immune system is very good at fighting off infections, but it sometimes gets out of whack. If you do feel like going into a doctor for help, you may want to bring along a friend who knows what she/he is talking about. If you aren't feeling well you can always call the National Multiple Sclerosis Society 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at 1-800-823-0677. \nI2\ BACK TO TOP","The best way is to keep the disease under control with daily exercise. But in some cases, you may need medical treatment. Aspirin and acetaminophen can help you feel better if it's not enough. If your symptoms are getting worse, see a doctor.

Q: How do I take vitamin D supplements?

A: Taking the right type of vitamin D is essential for maintaining good health. A study conducted by the National Institutes of Health found that taking a supplement containing 400 IU of vitamin D a day could reduce risk of stroke from 35 percent to 17 percent; decrease your risk of death from cardiovascular causes from 21 percent to 10 percent; and reduce heart attack rates from 6 percent to 1 percent. To get more vitamin D, eat foods rich in vitamin D such as milk, eggs, green leafy vegetables, oily fish, fortified cereals and soups, and fortified foods like milk, yogurt and fortified juices. For adults aged 50 to 70 years, the Institute of Medicine recommends 600 International Units (IU) of vitamin D each day. Adults over 70 should take two 500-unit doses of vitamin D every other week.

Q: What happens when my blood levels of vitamin K exceed 30 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL)?

A: Your body produces too little of this vitamin when your diet contains plenty of calcium. So before you start taking a prescription drug or another form of vitamin K supplement, check with your doctor. Some drugs contain vitamin K while others don't. Vitamin K deficiency has been linked to heart failure, high cholesterol, osteoporosis, memory loss, arthritis, depression, seizures, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, migraines, kidney stones, blood clots and nerve damage. In addition to increased risks, taking vitamin K often results in side effects including headache, fatigue, pain, rash, bone pain, weight gain and acne. Talk to your doctor about whether your medications contain vitamin K.

Q: Why doesn't everyone get enough iron?

A: Iron helps our bodies absorb water, which makes us stronger. Too much iron in your system can cause anemia. Even moderate amounts can increase your risk of developing liver cancer, heart disease and certain cancers, including breast, lung and colon cancer. To prevent these diseases and illnesses, talk to your doctor about how many servings of fruits and vegetables and whole grains your family eats each day. Eating more red meat and dairy products may also raise your iron intake. Ask your doctor about any dietary changes","The key is not only to keep a consistent and accurate record of your symptoms, but also to stay vigilant about the causes. There are many factors that may make MS worse or better, such as inflammation or infection. It's important to use an effective treatment strategy at all times and to learn what medications work best for you based on your individual case.

What should I do if I have persistent low back pain (spinal stenosis)?\nA: Spinal stenosis can be very frustrating because it can prevent proper functioning in some people. In addition to using an ergonomic chair to support your spine, it's important to watch out for other potential causes of spinal stenosis, such as arthritis, trauma, surgery or degenerative disc disease (such as diabetes). If you suspect spinal stenosis, speak with your health care provider so he or she can examine your spine to identify any possible root cause. Treatment options include medication and physical therapy.

How often should I take my medications?\nA: Your doctor will want to monitor how your body responds to different medications. You can safely use different types of medicines at the same time—for example, you could start taking one medicine and then switch back when you're feeling well again. Also, even though there are different drugs available over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription (PCP) medications, they usually interact differently; thus, it's critical to know which medications you need to be careful when using them together. For instance, if you need to stop taking an OTC drug to treat a medical condition, it might be helpful to switch back to a PCP medication first to allow your body to adapt to the change.","If you get the disease, your immune system attacks and destroys the nerves in your brain. The drugs that suppress a person's immune system are called immunosuppressants (in the English language, they're called antiretroviral therapy). It works by suppressing the viruses inside your body so you don't get infected with them or their proteins. But it also affects people who have autoimmune diseases, which means that some of the cells in their bodies attack and destroy the normal cells around them. Your body can repair itself from these damage, but if you still have symptoms, talk to your doctor about whether you should start taking these drugs again.

Can MS be prevented?\nA: One study found no link between the use of certain steroids and MS. There was a small increase in MS cases among those patients on low-dose aspirin or prednisone for several years before beginning treatment, as well as among those who started using corticosteroids early in MS—when there is a higher risk of the disease progressing. You shouldn't take any steroid unless you absolutely know how to do so safely. But experts say most people who want to prevent MS will benefit from having this information, since it helps them to make better decisions about where they choose to live, work, play, and eat. And the same holds true for other types of chronic illnesses such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. If you'd like more information, consult our Web site.

Do you need to drink alcohol?\nA: Not at all. Most studies show that moderate drinking doesn't seem to affect MS. In fact, some research suggests that the risks of excessive alcohol consumption may actually increase someone's chances of getting MS. That said, even very heavy drinkers aren't likely to develop MS. For example, if you drink two beers per day and don't binge, you won't get MS. If you get two drinks per day and don't have a problem, then you might not care what others think about you. So don't worry too much about your drinking habits. Just know that moderation has its limits. For example, you can never go overboard!

How many people in the United States got MS in 2011?\nA: Estimates vary widely, but at least 1 million Americans were diagnosed with MS in 2011. Nearly half of those affected were women, and one out of every four cases occurred in whites. A few thousand people had only mild problems. More than 200,000 people had milder, less","You can try all the traditional therapies, such as medications and lifestyle changes. But you also need a new approach that combines medication with other treatments to reduce the disability or improve quality of life. For example, in some cases a doctor may prescribe one drug for MS that is not available elsewhere because it has been approved by an FDA-approved study. The other therapy must be started at the same time (e.g., starting a pill before taking the medicine). The key is finding the right combination of drugs and starting them together at the same time. This strategy works best when your symptoms are moderate (no more than three months apart), but treatment should never stop until you feel better or the disease is controlled.

What would I get if I took five years' worth of these medications?

The U.S. government provides data about how effective each pill is against MS, including its safety and side effects. These data show that many people who take 5 years of pills experience a significant improvement after only 1 year. However, some people who take 5 years of pills will continue to have trouble controlling their disease for years afterward and continue having complications. In this case, patients may receive different types of medication over 5 years, which could lead to more serious side effects or even death.

What's the best way to tell whether the medication is working?

If you are already on a placebo, don't start any new pills during your first 4 weeks; the effect may diminish. If you started to respond to your current regimen and then stopped taking it for reasons unrelated to MS (for example, illness or injury), wait four weeks before moving forward with another regimen. Most doctors recommend using an ""as needed"" schedule instead of a ""every day schedule,"" so that you don't forget to take a pill whenever you feel like it.

How long does it take to see benefits from the medication?

Patients take 3 years to see the greatest benefit from the medication, according to recent research conducted by Dr. Siegel and his colleagues. Of course, no single patient is likely to experience a 100 percent response—so it may take longer for someone to see immediate results. The average response rate for MS medications used with MRI scanning was 78% within 2 years of beginning treatment.

Is there anything else you want me to know?

This information is based on a large number of studies and clinical trials; we cannot guarantee the accuracy or timeliness of these facts. Please ask your healthcare provider specific questions","You can find more information in the MS-related resources section.

[2] The term ""relapse"" is not defined. However, many patients who do relapse eventually improve and no longer have relapsing disease (although some may experience clinical remission). This phenomenon has been called a progressive regression or regressive remission.

[3] For example, although some patients with MS will achieve complete resolution of symptoms over time (and some are able to live independently), many do not. In addition, patients with severe relapses continue to show signs of ongoing disability for years after their initial episode.","1) Take an active role in the treatment of MS 2) Reduce or eliminate food, sugar, alcohol and caffeine 3) Try to make time for physical activity 4) Use exercise as a way of stimulating healing 5) Make use of natural supplements to relieve symptoms.

57,Q: multiple sclerosis stages phases\nA:,"there are several different kinds of MS that can occur, so don't worry about getting all the one stage. There is no single'stage' for MS that has been agreed upon. Also it's not like we have a set number of months or years to wait for the 'normal' progression of the disease. Each person will react differently and each time they'll get better at different rates.

Q: how long should patients expect to live?

A: that depends on many factors including age, current health, genetic predisposition etc. It generally takes longer than you think. The average life span in adults with relapsing-remitting MS is 9-11 years. So if your symptoms aren't improving over this period then it would be wise to try and get them under control as soon as possible – ideally within 2 years.

Also, keep in mind that all people respond differently and have different responses depending on their individual circumstances (eg medication, activity level).

If you have any questions please let me know by emailing me at sherry@theleapfrog.com. Thanks!","In the last part of MS, the disease progresses and symptoms become worse. Symptoms can be mild or severe in various stages. For example, a patient with advanced-stage MS may have a progressive loss of motor function on one side of their body while remaining completely immobile on the other side.

The most common form of MS is relapsing-remitting (RR) MS, which causes the nerve cells in the brain to stop sending signals to the muscles. The patient has very limited movement and usually knows they are ill because they often have trouble sleeping. Other forms of MS that involve a different type of immune system attack the central nervous system instead. There are two main types of patients with these diseases: those who have both MS and T2D and those with only MS. Those with both MS and T2D might not be aware of having another type of MS until it's too late.

T2D and MS are related but they are separate conditions.

What if I have both?

There is no cure for either condition. If you have MS, your doctors will work hard to make sure you get the right treatment, such as surgery to remove excess tissue from the spine. On the other hand, there are some treatments that will help you keep your life independent, including medicines called immunosuppressants or immunoglobulins, which act like steroids but do not slow down the disease. Immunosuppressant drugs also protect against infection.

You'll need to talk to your doctor about what medications and therapies might benefit you best when your treatment ends.","if you have multiple sclerosis symptoms or signs, but your doctor hasn't noticed any of the above, that's a good sign. Also, if there are no other symptoms noted (such as fatigue, lack of energy, loss of vision), it could be that you're not having MS.

What is MS?

MS is a chronic condition caused by damage to cells in the central nervous system (CNS). The main symptom is an inflammatory disease called relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). There are two types of MS; acute and chronic (short-term and long-term); each type can present differently with different symptoms and outcomes. In general, those who have RRMS appear to recover over time whereas others may progress more slowly. A person with chronic MS has persistent symptoms and usually requires ongoing treatment for the rest of their lives.

There is no cure for MS. However, many treatments exist such as medications, lifestyle changes, exercise, speech therapy, special diets and therapies, and supportive care.

Learn more about what causes MS here.

What does MS mean?

The term Multiple Sclerosis means ""multiple"" sclerosis in Greek meaning ""many"". It refers to an autoimmune disorder that affects all or part of one's body. Symptoms include muscle weakness, stiffness, spasticity (muscle pain), numbness/tingling, hearing problems, balance problems, headaches and blindness. Many people have no symptoms at all. But some people with MS have serious complications including death. Read more about MS at https://mrsfunderground.com/ms.htm.

How common is MS?

According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMS), between 15% and 22% of Americans will experience MS at some point in their lifetime. About 5% of people develop it every year. Those numbers vary from state to state. Some studies estimate that 2 million to 4 million people in the U.S. have MS, although this number has varied widely, even within states.

Many researchers believe that MS is on the rise because more people are living longer. While the number of new cases seems to go up each year, it's not clear how many of these are due to an increased prevalence of MS itself or to the use of newer medications. Researchers say there may also be higher rates of cancer and Alzheimer's","each stage has an associated symptom or disorder\r

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to pharmaceuticals, and more particularly, to a novel compound of Formula I comprising:

(i) one or more therapeutically effective excipients, (ii) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for the pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, and (iii) at least one nucleic acid sequence encoding an antibody against a member of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 family.

Accordingly, the inventive compounds are compositions that contain pharmacologically active substances having the ability to enhance or inhibit an immune response mediated by the immune system of humans, in particular, MS patients. These substances may include those known to be used in the treatment of diseases such as cancer, AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, and other immune-mediated illnesses. In addition, these compounds may also have the potential to help treat patients suffering from chronic inflammatory conditions and possibly also for prevention of various cancers including but not limited to leukemia, breast, prostate, kidney, colon, lung, melanoma, cervical, stomach, pancreatic, liver, skin, colon, endometrial, eye, bladder, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, thyroid, ovary, prostate, and testicular cancers. In the present example, the inventive substances comprise the antibody directed against the herpes simplex virus (HSV), which is considered to be the most common cause of infectious noninfectious disease, specifically genital herpes. The HAV, although known to be capable of causing disease, its pathogenesis remains unclear. Accordingly, the invention also contemplates an antigen-antibody combination therapy modulating the immune system of people who are susceptible to acquiring or passing on an infection caused by the HAV.

As described above, one useful approach to enhancing or suppressing an immune response mediated by the immune system of people with MS is through administration of one or more therapeutic agents. The use of one or more therapeutic agents can be accomplished via either oral or topical forms, i.e., administering the agent orally, or by injection, e.g., transdermal delivery methods. According to one embodiment of the present invention, an improved mode of administration of an antibody directed against the HSV can be achieved by incorporating a nucleic acid sequence into the amino acid sequence of the antibodies directed","I'm sorry, but that's not possible. The only way to know what stage you are in is through your symptoms and the effects of medications.


Q: why can't my dog eat food or drink water? A: Your dog will not take in any extra nutrients from foods or liquids which may cause a lack of energy or digestion. This problem can be corrected with diet changes or by supplementing them.


Q: How long does it take for an MS patient to recover after treatment? A: It depends on the disease severity. Symptoms usually return within 2-6 months and sometimes faster than this. Some patients may not come back at all and some are still suffering even though they have recovered. In some cases, the relapse can be very rapid as well! If you suspect that your pet may have a disease of the central nervous system, please see our MS treatment guidelines.","Multiple Sclerosis, Stage I to stage IV.

4-Fluoroacetate (3G) (also known as 3G phosphate or 3G/phosphatidylserine) is a synthetic analog of 5-fluorouracil that has been shown to have significant immunomodulatory properties in various immune mediated diseases including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus and Crohn's disease. It can be used to treat many different types of autoimmune diseases. This compound was originally developed by Drs. T.C. Martin of the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), Michael E. Smith of UC Berkeley, and Gert Schultes at Ludwig-Maximilians Universität Munich, Germany.

5- Fluorouracil (also known as 5-Fluorouracil or 5F) is an agent derived from a synthetic derivative of sodium fluoride which has a very high affinity for the 5-fluorouracil receptor, a critical component of the innate immune response to bacterial antigens found on cells and tissues of the body. The 5-fluorouracil receptor protein is expressed on glial cells and other tissues in the central nervous system.

6- Fluorescein is an ionic dye which forms blue light when exposed to oxygen, and red light when exposed to hydrogen peroxide. It can be easily absorbed into living tissue and released back upon exposure to air.

7- Folic acid is a naturally occurring vitamin B12 molecule. Its natural form is folic acid ethoxydase. The only way to synthesize folic acid is through a process called deiodination. Deiodination converts folic acid into its more biologically active form, folinic acid. The most commonly used forms are folic acid methyl ester and folic acid methyltaurate. These forms of folic acid are classified according to their molecular weights.

8- Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is one of the main compounds found in the human colon mucosa and plays a role in the normal function of the intestinal lining.

9- Glutathione is the chief antioxidant that protects cellular membranes against oxidation, inflammation and damage caused by free radicals such as nitrogenous free radical damage [1]. Glutathione also protects cellular membrane integrity and prevents excessive protein synthesis [2].

Q: do you have any specific evidence that your husband was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis?

A: Yes we did.

Q: and this happened before his first hospitalization for MS?

A: yes it happened in April 2009 to May 2010

Q: where did they diagnose him?

A: at an outpatient clinic. The hospital had been called a few times and said they needed more testing done on my husband but no diagnosis of MS were made there.

Q: when did your husband begin feeling like this?

A: He started getting depressed after being discharged from the hospital and then had to be admitted twice to see another specialist. This time he was told he had MS.

Q: when did you learn that your husband had Multiple Sclerosis?

A: My husband began having trouble sleeping and would go home crying and would not eat or drink anything during the day. His body began responding differently.

Q: how often does this happen?

A: often within 3-4 months after he becomes ill.

Q: why has my husband's reaction changed so dramatically?

A: Because he felt very guilty because he knew he didn't want people to know what had occurred in the past. Also there are many other symptoms in his health history which show signs of MS.


After reading through all this information and listening to it firsthand, Dr. Wilson said it sounded too good to be true...which it most certainly was! According to my husband, ""The doctors told me I was healthy and nothing could get worse."" And in fact it got worse. In June 2011, our family had a massive heart attack. It caused so much pain that we couldn't even move. We also had numerous episodes of vomiting (and still do) when we're sick. Our son suffered a head injury in 2013 and we suffered severe headaches, dizziness, nausea, exhaustion, and weakness. As a result of all this, my husband's vision went bad and he started bleeding internally. Since then, he has gone through an MRI of his brain every three weeks and each time it shows signs of a stroke. In the past week alone, his blood pressure shot up 500 points! In addition to these physical problems, we've noticed changes in my husband's mood, cognitive abilities, and ability to take care of himself. For example, he'll sometimes cry in"
58,Q: Risk to develop multiple sclerosis\nA:,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) suggests a reduced risk of developing MS with higher doses.

Risk of developing multiple sclerosis is increased by several factors, including age and sex. For example, men are more likely than women to be diagnosed with the disease in the first place. Males also experience higher rates of certain diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart failure.

There's no evidence that taking steroids or other drugs will prevent you from getting MS. If you have any questions about this matter, contact your doctor immediately.","Not known. PACE trial, not controlled trials.

6. Can I get a patent on my own cure?

Yes. A patent may be granted when the new technology has been identified and is in use by at least one other person or entity. In addition, if someone makes a breakthrough in a specific area of medicine, he or she can seek a patent for that discovery. However, you are also not allowed to claim your invention for yourself unless it was discovered through an independent research effort. For example, there are no laws against trying to sue a pharmaceutical company over another scientist's discovery of a more effective drug.

7. What happens to my royalties from selling the product I make with this vaccine?

The royalties will remain with the manufacturer. The profits made by this vaccine will be split between the manufacturers (who sell the vaccine) and the people who benefit from the vaccines.


8. How do I keep my rights to use my name on this vaccine?

You have a limited right of use regarding any name or logo associated with the product you produce using this vaccine. This applies regardless of whether you want to use this trademark in connection with your future products or services.

9. Is there anything I need to know about the risks of this vaccine before it is given?

This vaccine does not carry any long-term risk associated with its potential side effects.

10. Do I need to take this vaccine with my regular health care?

No, this vaccine is safe and should not be administered without medical supervision.","The risk is estimated at 1 in 50,000 to 10 million people.

The average age of the population who will experience this type of disease is between 70 and 80 years old, but it can occur as late as 90 years old. MS patients usually have a progressive form of the disease. There are many causes for MS and there is no one-size-fits all treatment approach. In fact, there are no known drugs that can cure or slow down the progression of this devastating disease.

Risk factors include genetics, diet, smoking, body weight, exercise, vitamin deficiencies, certain medications used, use of corticosteroids (a steroid hormone) and other lifestyle choices.

What Causes Multiple Sclerosis?

There are three major types of MS: relapsing/remitting, primary progressive and secondary progressive. Each has different causes and symptoms. Although they often have similar symptoms, the exact cause is not always obvious. In some cases, it may be difficult to identify why a person develops MS. Some of these triggers are autoimmune diseases, viral infections, toxins, toxins from chemotherapy, blood transfusions, surgery, trauma, injury to nerves or brain tissue, anoxia, infection, alcohol consumption, immunosuppression, cancer, diabetes, traumatic head injuries, exposure to high levels of radiation or ionizing radiation, tobacco smoke, and even food additives.

Some people with MS develop MS while their immune system attacks normal nerve cells and destroys the healthy ones. This damage leads to abnormal development of the nerve cell's mitochondria, which convert energy into chemical energy. Eventually, the damaged tissue begins to die off and nerve cells begin to die. A person does not necessarily need to have such extensive damage done to the nervous system before developing MS. But if enough damage occurs over time, the result can be severe disability. If left untreated, MS could lead to death within several decades.

Why Does MS Develop?

This type of disease is characterized by inflammation of the central nervous system - specifically the spinal cord, brain stem and myelin sheath surrounding neurons. Once the inflammation reaches critical levels, the cells in these areas become unable to function normally and ultimately fail altogether. This eventually results in an irreversible loss of nerve function and leading to multiple sclerosis (MS).

Multiple sclerosis affects approximately 25% of individuals who start their journey with MS. It generally appears during the early 20s to mid 30s, depending on how long ago the condition started and how severely it has progressed.","It depends on the amount of the drug, how long you've had it and how well you respond.

""The risk is small,"" says Dr. Andrew Kolodny, chief medical officer at MS Society. ""It's certainly not a big enough problem that we would recommend stopping the medication.""

In addition to these drugs, people can take other medications that help with symptoms such as headaches and weakness of their limbs. In about 2 percent of patients, those medicines are known to be associated with an increased risk of developing MS. Some research suggests that taking certain types of blood pressure medications may raise the risk even more than others, but they're rarely prescribed for this reason.

When these treatments aren't effective or there's no obvious cause for an increase in disability, people have been encouraged to use a variety of complementary therapies. These include acupuncture, massage therapy, herbal medicine and meditation. The most recent study found some evidence that yoga helped reduce the likelihood of developing MS.","I don't think it is likely. This type of disease only occurs in individuals that are exposed to a lot of repetitive stress (e.g., work, school, family). Most people have no risk factors for MS. There's no data suggesting that working long hours and/or being overweight or obese increases the risk for developing MS.

CJ: What is your opinion about the recent research on brain changes related to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)?


RK: My opinion is that CTE can be diagnosed through neuropathological examination using standard imaging techniques. However, some clinicians do not believe the findings from such tests constitute confirmation that this condition exists. The American Medical Association recognizes that this is true but does not endorse the clinical practice of declaring a diagnosis based solely on neuropathological exam results alone. If CTE is indeed the cause of an athlete's symptoms and disability, then the neuropathological evidence should establish its existence. It would seem reasonable that if this were proven, then many athletes would seek help so as to avoid having their brains examined to determine whether they might have CTE. In my experience, I've never seen any scientist advocate that a ""diagnosis"" of CTE by neuropathology alone was sufficient, given that the pathophysiology remains unclear. Some scientists argue that the neuropathological findings may merely reflect subtle differences between normal and pathological levels of TBI (toxic insult) that could be more easily identified with other diagnostic testing methods than neuropathological analysis alone. That said, it appears that there is an association between chronic exposure to repeated head trauma, particularly concussions, and the development of CTE.

CJ: Is there anything you would like to add?


RK: As someone who has been injured as both a football player and as a coach, I am encouraged at the progress of our understanding of how traumatic brain injuries affect the human body and thus the possibility for therapeutic intervention. With new technologies emerging every day, and the ability to diagnose and treat them, we can make significant strides toward finding a cure.

There are no reports of it having been an independent risk factor for developing MS. The association between MS and the use of cannabis appears unlikely due to lack of evidence.

Question 7 : Would you recommend that patients with a history of cannabis abuse be advised against using it? A: No, I do not recommend that they should stop using it because there is insufficient data to support any recommendation regarding their individual circumstances or drug interactions at this point in time.

Question 8 : Are there any recommendations on the safety of cannabinoids as medicinal products? A: We have found no clear evidence of possible harm associated with the consumption of cannabinoids as medicines, and we currently suggest caution when prescribing them. The only research in humans so far has not shown significant adverse effects related to medical cannabis use. These findings must therefore remain provisional until further research is conducted.

Question 9 : Is cannabis a health product? A: It does not appear to be a health product in Australia.","There are not enough data on the association between alcohol and MS, but many studies have shown a link between heavy drinking, poor nutrition (including diabetes) and risk of developing MS.

Q: How does alcoholism affect your health? A: Alcoholism affects several body systems. It can cause problems with blood sugar control, heart disease and even cancer. You also might find that you're less physically active than usual. Some researchers think that chronic alcoholism may be linked to increased risk for heart attacks.

Q: What are some common side effects from alcohol? A: Alcohol is an addictive drug and can lead to withdrawal symptoms when people stop using it. For example, one study found that drinkers who used alcohol reported more mood changes than those who did not drink, including anxiety, depression and difficulty sleeping. Other possible side effects include dry mouth, stomach pain, nausea and vomiting. However, most people recover quickly and don't experience these unpleasant effects.

Q: How much do I need to drink per day to become addicted to alcohol? A: Drinking too little can make you dependent on alcohol, making it harder to resist its effect. But even moderate amounts of alcohol can produce unwanted physical changes in the body, such as: low libido or reduced sexual drive; constipation; insomnia; nervousness, irritability, agitation, aggression or impulsivity; and weight gain. These unwanted changes usually last only a few weeks to months. If you start drinking and don't regain control, you could end up experiencing the same consequences.","The risk of developing MS is low, but there are currently no long-term studies that have been able to show a cause and effect relationship. However, research has shown the following: • In children with autism or Asperger's syndrome, treatment can decrease the chance of getting MS.

• In adults with MS, treating depression improves MS symptoms.

In addition to these long-term benefits, most patients experience relief from their MS symptoms within 3 years of starting treatment.

Q: How common is primary progressive multiple sclerosis? A: Approximately 1% of people will become disabled by this disease. Some studies suggest as many as one in 100 people over 50 have this type of MS.

Q: What causes it? A: Most individuals with active MS progress from milder forms such as migraine headaches and myalgias into more serious forms such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Other factors associated with PML include infections like MRSA and HIV, which are often treated successfully with medications.

Q: Does MS affect any part of your body other than the brain? A: It affects nearly all of the body except the hands, feet and head. People who also have multiple sclerosis, including those diagnosed early, may not be aware they have the condition because they don't have signs and symptoms that are usually present in people without MS.","The risk is low and the benefits are very small. A study in Sweden showed that people with MS who had a high dose of beta-blockers were at less risk for developing multiple sclerosis than those who didn't have any medication.

Q: Can you share your experiences with other patients? What kind of reactions did they have to taking these drugs, and what side effects occurred?

I began my MS journey as an adult when I was diagnosed with severe progressive Multiple Sclerosis (MS). As part of treatment, we started using Biotin as one of our first medications because it was proven safe and effective against the disease.

After starting Biotin, my symptoms disappeared completely within 1 year and I started to feel much better. Since then, I've used Biotin daily and it's made a difference in my quality of life. My MS has improved significantly since beginning Biotin, but unfortunately I still suffer from depression, anxiety, fatigue, joint pain and more chronic conditions than before taking Biotin.

My friends, family members and doctors all love Biotin! They say it works so well because it causes blood vessels to contract even faster during periods of intense physical activity. It also helps reduce inflammation, which can be caused by autoimmune diseases like MS.

You can learn more about the benefits of Biotin and its many uses here.

Biotin® (vitamin B3) Dosage: 30 mg orally twice daily (e.g., three times per day), preferably taken on an empty stomach.


In addition to Biotin®, there are two additional types of Biotin-containing medications (vitamins C and E):

Vitamin C

The most commonly prescribed form of vitamin C is given as intravenous injection. This means that you inject the drug into your vein via a catheter placed through a needle inserted into the forearm or leg. Vitamin C is recommended over oral forms of this compound because it will not interfere with absorption from food or water. The drug is available only as an intravenous solution and cannot be ingested whole.

Vitamin E

This form of vitamin E may be given by a single injection into the arm or leg once every 3 months or once every 4 years if a long-term maintenance regimen is being followed. The dosage may be increased gradually, depending upon the individual patient.

Advantages

• No need for separate injections

• Fast acting – no withdrawal symptoms"
59,Q: long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis\nA:,"The evidence is mixed. Some studies show that treatment with a beta blocker, such as gabapentin, can reduce the risk of MS. Others have shown no benefit (see above). Also, many patients do not respond to any form of therapy.

CURE: The disease has been completely cured in all patients who received this drug.

What about using it for depression?

This is a more controversial question than you might think. One study found that low doses of rosuvastatin were beneficial for people with major depressive disorder. But there are some caveats here. Many studies suggest that antidepressants don't work as well as they used to, and one study found that half of people who received both an antidepressant and anti-depressant medication did not experience improvement after six months. Another study found that higher dosages of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, may be useful for treating depression but only if the drugs are taken with food. More research needs to be done to establish whether these drugs are effective for depressed patients who don't respond to other therapies.

Many clinicians believe that low levels of cholesterol also make people healthier. They argue that high blood cholesterol is associated with increased risks of heart attacks and stroke, and lower levels of LDL (""bad"") cholesterol are linked to fewer deaths from heart disease. Other researchers say that high levels of total cholesterol are associated with increased risk of diabetes mellitus. The evidence shows that lowering cholesterol isn't likely to cause problems; however, taking statins does seem to help prevent type 2 diabetes.

Which other treatments should I try first?

If your doctor doesn't prescribe drugs or surgery right away, ask him or her what others could be tried first. If your symptoms aren't improving within six weeks or so, contact your primary care provider for advice on starting other medications or procedures.

It's important to keep in mind that even though a particular treatment works for you, it will probably not necessarily work well for everyone. There are several factors that affect how well certain medicines work for you:","Yes, some people may have longer-lasting disability. People with MS who continue to progress or recover from the disease also may be more likely to develop another form of the illness. However, it is not possible to predict exactly how many people will eventually experience long term disability after they receive treatment and maintain their health.

Q: what would you say to a patient who was just diagnosed with MS? A: You should talk to your doctor about getting an MRI of your brain. This test can help determine whether you are at risk for having a stroke or other problems when you get older. Also check in with your neurologist on a regular basis.

PMS is a very serious disorder, but there are also many side effects that can occur for those who have MS. The following are just some of the side effects that people report after taking PMS medications. If you or someone in your family has experienced any of these symptoms, please call 1-800-356-4434 for help finding an MS treatment center.

Common Side Effects Associated With PMS Medication

• Nausea and vomiting • Difficulty concentrating/thinking • Increased appetite/weight gain • Rash • Tiredness • Sore throat • Dry mouth • Decreased vision • Weakness/muscle weakness • Low energy level

What Should You Do Instead of Taking PMS Medications?

You should try to reduce the risk factors associated with MS so you may avoid having MS in the future. Here are some tips to keep you healthy:

Eat a balanced diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low fat dairy products, lean proteins, fish, beans, nuts, seeds, seeds, and whole grain breads (whole grain bread products such as wheat, barley, rye, and oats). These foods provide essential nutrients needed by everyone during periods of increased inflammation. Choose foods like fruits, dark green leafy vegetables, eggs, avocados, peanut butter, soy milk, raw nuts, fish, tofu, tempeh, nuts, dried fruit, and protein powder to replace saturated fats found in meat, animal products, oils, and refined carbohydrates. Eat at least 30 minutes before meals to decrease the possibility of stomach acidity from cooking and eating too quickly. Consume small amounts of water throughout the day to ensure adequate hydration. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids throughout the day and especially after exercise, which can increase the likelihood of dehydration. Drink lots of water while exercising. Use antacid medication to prevent dehydration if necessary. Avoid drinking alcohol and caffeine during periods of high stress due to MS. Consider reducing the amount of physical activity in order to minimize the potential for muscle damage due to MS.

If your doctor tells you to stop taking PMS medications, make certain you take these steps within 72 hours to remain protected from the complications of MS. This includes:","The most common treatment options are immunosuppressants. There is no evidence that these treatments prolong survival in the short term. In fact, many of the more promising options are not available for MS patients.

Q: do some people with MS have increased risk for brain injury? A: No specific research has examined this question. However, we know from other studies that there may be a positive association between head injuries and cognitive impairment. As long as there is only one stroke or traumatic brain injury per year, it's important to monitor all types of trauma (for example, falls) and their prognosis with an eye toward preventing cognitive impairment. If you have suffered a concussion, then your neurocognitive symptoms might improve after concussions but may persist for months or years following a subsequent injury. The number of times a person can sustain multiple concussions is unknown, however; therefore, a careful evaluation should be made before making any decisions about which type of concussion to get.

Q: if I had chronic pain at the time of my MRI scan does this mean I'll suffer from headaches later on? Is this normal? A: Yes, headaches will increase in frequency following repetitive head trauma and there is some evidence that chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is related to brain atrophy. Chronic pain after head trauma is unlikely to cause problems for decades. However, you should continue to consider alternative health management options such as physical therapy, acupuncture, yoga, and other complementary therapies until further study confirms that headache/tension associated symptoms don't occur due to brain damage or other causes. You can also try avoiding certain activities or taking care of yourself if you feel fatigued and tired while exercising.

Q: can I use a magnetic resonance imaging machine or CT scanner to evaluate my head injury? Can they tell me how much damage was done? A: Magnetic resonance imaging machines will detect only microscopic particles in the blood and tissue. Therefore, MRI won't reveal anything about whether or not your brain has been damaged by a head injury. CT scans can show structural damage or even determine whether something is still wrong in the brain. MRI can also help doctors identify areas where brain cells aren't working properly. Doctors who perform these evaluations often recommend avoiding driving, operating machinery, reading and writing, and using computers while you're resting to prevent injury to your nervous system during the examination.","Yes.

The link between obesity and stroke has been established, not just in humans but also in animals. An analysis of more than 60 previous studies suggested a connection between greater body weight and increased risk of heart attack, myocardial infarction or stroke. One review found that ""moderate excess weight could result in a 10% increase risk of death from cardiovascular causes"". And yet, despite decades of research, there is little evidence linking being overweight with a higher risk of developing strokes. The most recent large clinical trial, led by investigators at Brigham and","There are many different types of MS and they all have a very low relapse rate. It is more complicated than that, but the research shows it's still within 5 years for most people with this type of disease, so I think if we can find some treatments or strategies to delay that even further we could be able to help many more people. Q: if you were in your position would you try to improve the way medicine works? A: I don't see anything wrong with the current system. If there was something that made me want to change it then I probably wouldn't come back as an MPI doctor.

You also asked about patients' attitudes towards doctors – and the answer from each patient group is clearly starkly different. But perhaps what is surprising here isn't just that there is such a huge variation between individual cases, but that it matters. This reflects our tendency as humans to compare ourselves against others, and to assume that we know how other people experience life. And yet when I asked the respondents who had been diagnosed with MS whether they believed there was any significant difference between their own diagnosis (in which they had felt unwell) and that of the general population, the majority said no. Indeed, only one in ten said they thought people like them had experienced a major improvement over the past five years. The rest felt that, while they might not have suffered a lot themselves, they'd benefited a fair bit from their experiences. In short, there was an overwhelming sense among these individuals that they didn't suffer significantly from MS.

What is more striking is how often people cited their personal circumstances as a factor driving their desire to remain quiet. For example, one woman explained her reluctance to talk about the illness by saying she needed time to think through her options: 'It took me weeks to get up the courage to start talking about my diagnosis.' Others described having to hide their condition because the family members who supported them feared ridicule from friends. One young man described being worried that his parents would 'get rid of him', and another said he couldn't sleep after learning that someone else had recently been diagnosed with the same disease:

I wasn't going to let someone tell my parents what was happening to me… I was thinking I was going to end up on a bed in a dark room with the lights off, alone without anybody knowing where I was. I was scared about losing my home and family… My dad said that it was going to make it difficult for us to live in the city at least for the","no clear evidence of a causal relationship between the two conditions.

A: multiple sclerosis is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality, but there are no good data on this relationship over time or in people who have recovered from MS.


The overall picture of health outcomes from MS is not well understood. However, current findings do suggest that a high prevalence of disability among some individuals may increase the risk of future disease (eg, because they require more medical care). In addition, the presence of an existing heart condition appears to be associated with a higher risk of future heart disease. There is little conclusive information about whether a person's family history of cardiovascular disease is related to the development of MS. A study published in January 2008 found a strong association of inherited mutations in the X chromosome with a significantly elevated lifetime risk of developing MS. The same mutation was also found in 9% of families of a patient who later died from MS, suggesting that such familial transmission occurs frequently.[3] These studies are limited by small numbers, so we can't conclude anything about these associations; however, if true, then they would provide further support for a role of genetic factors in MS pathogenesis. Further work is needed to understand how the presence of certain mutations increases the risk of getting MS, and why.


We cannot yet say with certainty whether genetic factors play a part in determining a person's susceptibility to develop MS, although epidemiological studies on MS are ongoing. Nonetheless, it seems reasonable to believe that environmental exposures can alter genes, as there is a correlation between blood levels of heavy metals and the risk of several forms of cancer. For example, low levels of lead exposure have been shown to reduce immune function, making people more prone to infections, which has important implications for MS patients. Also, while there are only a few documented cases of children being born with severe autism, many others exhibit behavioral deficits, including difficulties with language and social interaction. It is possible that children exposed early in life to mercury from contaminated dental fillings or inhalation of industrial chemicals could become susceptible to similar issues. More research is required on both sides to examine the role of these factors, but until such studies are completed, it will remain unclear what the best way forward is regarding prevention and treatment.

In general, the effects of medical treatments tend to be greater after the first year of use than at any other point in a patient's life. Therefore, even though the incidence of MS does seem to decline during remission, it should be noted that clinical success is","studies have not found a relationship between MS and prolonged use of the drug.

A: There is no research indicating that long term use of MS drugs causes any long-term changes in health. In fact, many people take these medications for years without experiencing any problems.

B: The only side effect you may experience is sleep disturbance during treatment. If this occurs, stop taking MS drugs until your symptoms improve or you find another way to help treat your condition.

C: Side effects related to MS drugs are rare, but sometimes they occur when the medicine is used as directed (i.e., for longer than recommended). These can include nausea, vomiting, fever, headache, muscle pain, dizziness, depression and anxiety. See the full list at www.msmedsinfo.com/sideeffects.html

D: It's important to understand that there is no evidence to support the use of MS drugs for more than 2 weeks, unless your doctor has prescribed an extended duration therapy using a regimen of medications designed specifically for the conditions associated with long-term disability and risk of relapse and death.


In addition, most people who start off taking MS medication develop the same serious side effects as those seen in the general population. Therefore, if you choose to continue on this medication and experience these side effects, discuss them with your doctor before starting new treatment.

E: To reduce the chance that the MS drug will cause significant problems while your body tries to rebuild its own nerve cells, keep doses low over time. Your doctor should monitor how often you need your treatment and prescribe appropriate dosages based upon clinical trial data. A good guideline is 1 tablet twice daily, taken just before bedtime.

F: The side effects from MS drugs generally do not last very long; however, you must be aware of possible risks associated with taking these medicines. For example, while some patients experienced an improvement after stopping the drug, others did not. If you feel the benefits of the medication have diminished or disappeared, you should consult your doctor about alternatives. Some people prefer not to change their medications, so you'll need to determine whether it's safer to remain on your current treatment plan or try other options such as cognitive behavioral therapies (cognitive behavior therapy), natural supplements (natural products like herbs), acupuncture, psychotherapy, massage, chiropractic care, etc.

Categories of MS in Adults and Children

Adult MS is a common chronic disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Many adults with adult onset MS have multiple sclerosis (MS). Multiple sclerosis affects up to 50% of people who have MS. Approximately one-third of people diagnosed with MS will develop additional forms of MS after diagnosis. These other forms include myelin disorder (myelopathy), and optic neuritis. In addition, many patients may be genetically predisposed to the development of more severe forms of MS or who are treated for their primary form.

The most commonly reported types of adult MS are relapsing remitting (RRMS) and progressive multifocal leukoencephalomyelitis (PML). Other types of MS are familial relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (FHMR), focal pontine glioma, and nonfocal intracerebral hematologic malignancies (NFIHS). Treatment options for each type vary according to risk factors. Most patients who respond to therapy improve over time, although treatment failure rates remain high at approximately 40%. There are also individuals who do not respond to treatment or who relapse. Patients with RRMS and those with MM are different from others; they are more likely to receive chemotherapy before responding to therapy, and they often require hospitalization during remission periods as well. The vast majority of cases occur in adolescents, but there has been an increase in MS among older adults since 2009. Some studies suggest that the incidence of all three types of MS has increased dramatically in the last several decades.

There were estimated to be about 14 million people living with MS worldwide at year end 2013, representing 12% of the global population. About 1.8 million new cases of MS were recognized nationally during this period. The median age of people with MS was 62 years (IQR 52–69). Of these, 731,000 adults aged 65 years or older and 487,000 children under 18 years old had a"
62,"Q: disclosing multiple sclerosis at work, how will colleagues react?\nA:","It's hard for people to understand. I don't think they'll mind, but a lot of them have been really good about it and I'm sure they've tried to be supportive. As long as you're taking care of yourself and being able to function in society, most people are fine with that. In fact, in many cases it makes things easier on me because I can take time off now so that I can focus on my MS therapy. Q: do your family feel the same way?\nA: My mother is very supportive and she says she'll keep an eye out for me. She also loves to give hugs when she sees me go through my symptoms. And her sister was diagnosed two years ago too! But that hasn't changed anything. Q: do you ever find yourself unable to perform?\nA: Yeah, sometimes. The worst thing is getting tired during the day. Sometimes I just throw up because my body gets tired. So I try to avoid doing physical activities like walking or even running unless I am doing a session where I know that I will actually get more done. Q: are you able to communicate?\nA: Yes, I could write, but no one understands what I say. Some of my relatives were diagnosed several years ago. When they see me, they ask if I remember anything from their past, or if I had any problems before. They tell me that everything has gotten better for me since I got better. Most importantly, they thank God every single day that he made me. Q: Do you believe in miracles? If so, what would be the best thing you'd do?\nA: No miracles yet, although I have faith that someday I might be able to heal someone's ailment. After all, I have lived so much already. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - 2- [5] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Q: You mentioned earlier that when you felt a little down after going home, and your doctor prescribed some medicine, did you have any doubts about whether this drug was right for you? \nA: Well, there was only one reason why I started treatment with the new medication. That's not because I wanted to help others, but rather because the doctor told me that they weren't available anywhere else. The other drugs I took, however, worked quite well for me. However, I wasn't 100% certain that the drug would help me. Since it doesn't come with any side effects, I decided to start treatment immediately. Q: Is this all the","they'll be surprised to hear the severity of my symptoms and I think that is something that's going to surprise a lot of people. As for patients who don't want to be reminded about MS by me... well I'd rather have them go to someone else, or look up information on a website or see what their doctor has said on social media than read this book.\nA: does it help anyone with any kind of chronic disease to know you've had two strokes in your life? The answer is yes. It certainly helps those affected by MS to know they are not alone. I remember one patient in particular who came in with severe problems she was having with her right leg which was numb and painful. She couldn't walk. One of our most successful fundraisers at the time asked if we could set up a meeting for her with a neurologist so she could be seen, not because she wanted to get better but because she knew that no one else would come forward and tell her the truth. She didn't feel confident talking about her condition as often as she did because it wasn't something she could hide. She was able to talk openly about being disabled and needing medical assistance.

What follows is an interview with Madison Madsen regarding her memoir and her experiences in raising money for MMS, as well as a description of the book's contents (including a preview video). The interview took place on September 24th 2013 and was conducted over Skype using a recording device provided by Madison's friends and family. Since writing this book I have been fortunate enough to find a way to provide both audio and written content to fund MMS. Unfortunately, in order to do so I needed to purchase equipment and software, as well as hire a professional writer to produce the online version of the book. Although there were several other options available, the best one presented itself after Madison received the book through Kickstarter in August 2014. What I'm grateful for is that I've been given the opportunity to use all of these resources while also giving back to the community that has supported me since I first started writing about my experience. In fact, I would even say that this project has made me a more","I am afraid they will not be happy.\s1#_*#E+D#I%3B%2C_/^%-H^J>K9N$%5O#8&!=Z]PZY@_4U%M[R,)L(G*F5&7]V)S^<`;6YV0YV=7'9O M3J-O2D?X9W6\4T3W6Y;M.YJ""\N\O]&/=I.Q0Y%D8/1_Q_]D_6$BKU_:8?3.F=%KF=U^ M=A,8O[9Q-&-<O`H-F%L+^Q.+^&Y5C5,G^QHJKM.G,K3.C@Y_=4V6.B$&;=;V2O] M.Q@(#^ZY*#_<8;P?%#?*`4<2!<Y9I$`K*0^\:>Y+QF/E=YW#;D#V;@Z$XBX1.%M M`J/<9.0]I8@T+/T(YVV-L_7>M@1M^7+?\+_@:O_6K`/<7H-F?S7U1R_Z_:1@O^ M_PX1U]E2:K/J&1-`*0^3W)ZL)1+&8P<_]1UZ@+JY_7P`8<1Z_\9H1G\1+M`M8- M'A-3C/9=&=3Z/V?*P/YU:M,UYX0;8=K]`$4,R4XB2LJ^\[+H2.+>Y*K7V>+1^/6, MN#!_+L,8/5@W?&3UZ7/Q>#<QH6>V$K^[F+E%","I'm just looking to be a good teammate. \r

Q: is there anything you'd like to share with the community about MS?\nA: I've had some of my patients tell me that they have not seen any positive changes in their mood or energy level since starting treatment for MS. I know this isn't healthy and it's hard to take. But I want to say I am grateful to everyone who has supported me through this difficult time. I hope to help as many people as possible by sharing what I can. I will continue to work with our support team and have a few more updates in the coming weeks... Thank you! \r

Read more","For me there are a few things I am aware of that are going to change. First off I have had a diagnosis for 5 years and it is known that I don't need to be around other people with MS because I was diagnosed when I had no symptoms. So if people are looking for someone who needs a job to get through the day, or something else where they could find me and have me be an asset in the workplace, that's going to change a bit. Second, I am very clear about what is expected of me now. I know exactly when my turn is coming and I am going to do everything possible to meet that deadline. Third, I've done enough research on MS to know that I'm not going to have any problems getting hired or finding employment again as long as I stay within those parameters. The last thing I want to do is put myself in a position where someone sees that I can't function normally but doesn't realize I might be living with a disability. I've got to keep my head up and not let my symptoms take over my life because they'll always come back to bite me. Q: you mentioned your time in medical school before getting into medical practice. What role did you play at all as far as teaching and mentoring patients during your residency? A: It was mostly a lot of explaining how different treatments worked. Not really much clinical experience. Also I wasn't taught how to read patients' charts. In fact I think there were only 3 courses we ever took together, one being a group, and two were individual seminars. They were pretty basic classes, so I didn't learn anything new. Q: how did you deal with family members who wanted more information than was available from your website? A: My parents thought I would be doing better as a physician if I went on to medical school. But when I started my residency program, I realized just how limited their knowledge was, and then when I became the resident assistant and saw first hand how many patients they missed due to time restrictions, they stopped coming to see me. After seeing these numbers every single year, I knew that I needed to go beyond my training and start educating them. This is why I created The MS Society. If doctors weren't aware that they were missing patients because they weren't able to make appointments, I figured I should have made that available by now.

[Diary of Dr. Robert Lutz] Q: Can you describe yourself in 1 sentence? A: I am","I think it's going to be a lot of fun. In fact, the other day I was reading an article about a woman who wrote in and said that she would have loved to be able to go into work as soon as possible after having her mastectomy and getting back on the horse again. So I am excited about what's happening with my book, because I think it makes a big difference for people like her who want to go back to their jobs and feel normal about it. But I also worry about other people who don't think they can or should do this kind of thing for themselves. Some people may not want to admit that they're disabled, so we need to talk about it more openly now, especially if you're doing something that really feels right -- making the leap from being disabled to working, which is what some people may decide to do once they get off the couch. Q: do you see yourself taking up another disability, such as depression? \nA: I've been thinking about depression and having a professional look into whether I'm depressed enough to be qualified for the job. \nBut for me, I'd rather take a job where there are other people who are disabled and happy, and have those jobs than one where everyone has to deal with depression all the time. And then you know, there's a part of me that wants to try things like that for myself. As long as it doesn't come down to depression, and we can figure out ways of making the workplace more inclusive for everyone, I'll keep trying. Q: What advice would you give someone who had tried a similar course of action before but found their life got worse? How could they make sure they weren't falling through the cracks when it comes to getting hired in the future? \nA: It depends, really. If it's a job that you enjoy, and you feel that there aren't many people around who are like you anyway, you might just continue doing your own thing until you find something better that pays better or gives you more control over your life. But if you're feeling stressed about your job, about what you're putting into it, and about the way it affects others, you might consider looking into other careers. When I first started my career in medicine, I went to school to study psychiatry. But then I took two years out so that I could get my master's degree and get involved in research, which is much more exciting than studying an obscure topic like psychiatry. For me, the most important","I have already had a couple of offers to speak in the same room as me. I don't know what they'll think. It's not like we're going to be on every talk show talking about this or that thing that you might have heard of that is related to my disease, but it's something people are interested in and they want to hear more about it. So there could be some interest from colleagues too. Q: What would you say if someone asked you to explain your illness to them? A: I wouldn't worry so much about explaining it since I'm not sure anyone else has any clue. But yeah, it would be nice if someone could ask my husband about it because he knows all about MS. He is not even sure it exists, but he has been diagnosed with one and has seen it grow over the years and he thinks it was really well-understood then and now, I guess it's becoming more of an accepted fact and part of a wider story. I am very lucky, actually, having that diagnosis and being able to see it and do things like go back to school for college when my diagnosis came through and finally start doing the things I enjoy doing and that I love. And I have three children who are now living normal lives because of my diagnosis and they got their education the way they should have done so that they didn't feel like they were missing out and were able to pursue other interests than playing video games and watching television. So I thank God for that! My kids seem pretty happy. They are not necessarily my favorite kind of kid but they're still real friends of mine and when they walk into our home or come to visit I get to play with them. I can't wait for when they're older so I can continue to enjoy them as much as possible. Q: What's next for you? How are things with MS looking right now? A: Well, in terms of getting better, I just keep learning new tricks that help me improve my performance every day. I mean, if you look at sports or exercise, it becomes obvious once you get to a certain level that you've got to find ways to reach that point. That's not unique to MS. There is no magic bullet for it, so it's important to learn new skills. For example, if you're working out, you need to try to stay injury free by performing these movements differently to make sure your body doesn't hurt. The first time I did squats with weights I started feeling pain in my shoulder muscle","The first step in disclosing multiple sclerosis to your coworkers is to set up a personal meeting with your boss. Ask that you be given the opportunity to speak and explain why it's important for you to disclose this illness to coworkers. This may happen several times throughout your career. You can also write an email to your manager expressing your desire to share your MS symptoms with others. Be sure to include what you're going through and ask your supervisor to encourage you to do so.\r

After you've made the decision to tell your co-workers, try not to discuss your condition too much (except when you have some other relevant information). This may seem obvious but may be difficult if you feel like there are people who don't understand. Keep in mind that many employees might see you as being less than fully informed about their health conditions.\r

When it comes time to reveal your MS symptoms to your employer, ensure that you take all reasonable steps to make it clear that you understand and appreciate the importance of sharing your disease with those around you. Your coworker's reaction will likely depend on how they view this issue. Some may be supportive or even happy to hear you say that you've been thinking about telling them; others may frown upon it (or they won't know how to deal with it) because they think you should just keep quiet. If your boss says something like ""I'm sorry I didn't realize it was a big deal,"" then it's probably best to just walk away from the conversation. However, if your boss does approach you with a question of his own regarding your symptoms, be prepared to provide additional details such as a photo, description, or even a physical diagnosis (if any), to help him better assess your situation.\r

Keep in mind that it isn't always possible to tell everyone else about your MS. For example, some people fear that having a relative or friend with a similar disability may interfere with the way they view their MS and cause them to feel embarrassed. In these cases, they may refuse to let anyone know about their MS. You may need to avoid talking about MS during your job interview or the next time you meet with a potential new employee. Similarly, your boss might think that it would be rude or uncomfortable to ask about your MS with someone he doesn't already know very well. So you'll want to focus on remaining positive and upbeat while telling your story -- keeping the conversation lighthearted and friendly.\r

If you do decide to share your MS with","I think it's going to be very uncomfortable. That's what you have to deal with when the boss is a smoker or has diabetes. They can't understand that it may not be healthy for them, but at least they won't get mad or anything like that.

Q: If someone was working on something else and wanted more information about it, are there any ways in which we could ask?\nA: It's so hard to find out what is happening. We've tried asking people directly if they're working on things that have nothing to do with the disease and then they'll say yeah. But people don't want to answer questions because they know they might hurt their career. A lot of doctors have a hard time answering simple questions. We try to encourage people to talk to us privately, but even though patients are doing this on our side, we just feel like patients would rather not come forward. We also realize the fact that some people aren't going to want to go public. For example, there was one patient who told me she had a chronic back problem that kept her from having mobility. So when she heard I was researching MS, she asked me, ""What is MS?"" And I said, ""Well, it's an autoimmune disorder."" She didn't believe me until she saw my research. After she took my lab tests, she was able to walk around without pain. Her family members weren't sure whether she had MS or whether her back problems were hereditary. And the next day, after seeing my research, the doctor called and said he thought her back issues were genetic. So she ended up getting treated by me in his office.


The next question was what to do about the stigma surrounding MS and what kind of stigma is acceptable when dealing with physicians and the general public? As well as what should be done to change doctors' beliefs and attitudes towards MS?

Q: What is your take on the medical establishment's role in the perception of MS?\nA: Well, obviously, everyone knows MS exists, but that doesn't mean it's a bad thing or that we shouldn't discuss it. In fact, if anyone wants to see someone diagnosed with MS and then treated, they need to treat them. And those conversations are important, especially for young people, who have been exposed only through television or movies. The media is often sensationalist in its portrayal of diseases such as MS. We still haven't figured out what's causing these false perceptions and misconceptions—and that makes it","I feel like this is going to be a big issue for me. But I'm confident that my doctor and team are going to do everything they can to make sure that it doesn't happen again.""

In the past four months alone, MS has been reported in more than 20 patients at the FDA's Division of Diversionary Drugs. Of those cases, three were reported at the office of Dr. Anthony Saccoccio, the lead investigator on the new study and one who was not an employee of Pfizer. The remaining six people are employed by other companies or have no connection with Pfizer. None received any financial compensation from Pfizer for their participation."
63,Q: Will multiple sclerosis affect my career?\nA:,"Not necessarily. People with MS have an increased risk of developing other chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. It's important to note that people can develop MS without ever having a relapsing-remitting form of the illness called primary MS or secondary MS.

It is one of the most debilitating illnesses anyone can have. And as a member of Congress, I am always very aware that patients with MS are more likely to be affected by their votes than any other group in Congress. So let me just say again – this legislation has been the subject of intense debate in Washington and will likely go through several iterations before being signed into law.\n\n

I think we all agree that the best way for people with MS or MS-related conditions to live their lives is to avoid having physical disabilities. But unfortunately, many Americans who suffer from MS don't want to risk losing their jobs because they cannot work. That's why we're working with both our colleagues on the Hill and at the State Department to ensure that we address the needs of those individuals who are unable to take care of themselves without assistance. When it comes to workplace mobility, I've heard from many people who say they simply do not wish to relocate, but find themselves forced to leave home due to illness or disability. While I recognize that this may be difficult for them, I believe that there should be greater consideration given to whether relocation is an appropriate solution. If you need an alternative employment option (whether at your office or outside) then please contact me so that we can help. Please note that, while I believe that these provisions are consistent with the spirit of the Affordable Care Act and provide additional options for those with MS or MS-related conditions, I'm concerned that such policies could cause some workers with MS and related conditions to lose out due to the increased cost associated with relocating. \n\n

Thank you for supporting the effort to make sure more people can stay healthy and productive, and I look forward to working alongside my Republican colleagues to advance legislation that makes good policy choices for each of us -- both in Washington and around the world.\n\n","It depends on the type of MS that you have. If your primary immune system is compromised and there are no other symptoms, then it will be very difficult for you to become a physician or an advocate because patients with MS may not be able to work. On the other hand, if you have severe disease such as Multiple Sclerosis X (MS-X), where the immune system is severely impaired but all remaining symptoms remain present, then you will be able to perform at the level that most people can do today. And I'm sure the patient community in general would welcome this opportunity to see more physicians with disabilities. In fact, we're planning to create a program at the VA Medical Center in Cincinnati called Patient Assistance Program - Disability Services that will help provide resources for individuals who need assistance when seeking employment.\r

It's clear from these responses that many doctors have little patience for people suffering from chronic conditions that leave them exhausted, disorganized, isolated, and unable to maintain their professional relationships with family members, coworkers, and clients. The medical profession should take note of how it fails to offer any sort of support for its employees. Unfortunately, the AMA has shown a remarkable unwillingness to change this behavior and continues to insist that physicians must ""just get over it."" The American Medical Association does not seem interested in changing its negative image among the public, which also discourages prospective doctors from practicing medicine. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \8\ Ibid., p. 17. This is despite overwhelming evidence indicating that some forms of disability can impair quality of life. See, e.g., http://www.hhs.gov/programs/pda/research_reports/mf_recovery_and_the_healthcare_economy.htm; http://www.dvacationrecovery.org/research/docs/MFA%20Reimbursement%20Studies%20Report%202006%201.pdf; http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5030a6.htm. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- There seems to be a widespread perception that the medical profession doesn't care about disabled persons and is actively discouraging them from seeking medical treatment. As with the government, many physicians are unwilling to acknowledge their role in the problem and continue to believe that they can get away with treating their patients like non-disabled children rather than treating them like adults with disabilities. For example, Dr. Jodie Taylor of the University of North Carolina wrote the following","The symptoms of MS can be so severe that it's impossible to work for more than two years, and we don't know what the long-term consequences will be. You should consider getting your doctor an annual physical when you have any symptoms of MS. \r

\nThe National Institutes of Health recommends that people with MS get their doctor a yearly physical as part of treatment. It also recommends that anyone who has a new diagnosis within one year get their own checkup or follow up visit at least every six months. For people who don't have this kind of health insurance, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs provides free health care for people who are in active combat situations and is planning on expanding its coverage. If you're already receiving VA benefits, there are some other ways to find out whether your VA benefits may cover medical costs related to MS.

Q: How do I make sure I'm covered under disability compensation if I have MS?\r

A: The American Disability Compensation Act specifies which organizations are eligible to receive disability compensation payments based on disabilities incurred after September 11, 2001. According to the Department of Defense: ""Disability compensation funds are funded through federal appropriations."" This means that you don't need a waiver from Congress to access disability payouts. However, if you believe you were entitled to a disability payment because of a service-connected disability that occurred before September 11, 2001, contact the disability compensation agency to learn about how to request such a waiver.


If you've been disabled by terrorist attacks or acts of war, you must file a claim for disability pay with the Social Security Administration. But once you've filed for disability, you'll never lose eligibility for Medicare or Medicaid unless you die. Also, federal employees will continue to receive disability benefits even after they retire. Learn more.\r

Questions About Your Medical Records\r

You may not think of your doctor as your personal doctor, but he or she might be your first point of contact with doctors throughout your life. When you go to see your doctor, you probably take away information about yourself—your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, weight, height and gender—that can help you manage your condition. Most importantly, though, you'll be able to ask questions about your disease and symptoms. And this information can help you determine","I have not had any serious health problems. My career has been unaffected by MS and we're very optimistic about it moving forward.""

In response to a question from the audience, she said that her husband is ""dying"" and that they need to keep their family together as much as possible while still doing things for themselves, including writing novels. She also thanked the audience for coming out.

Her wife, who also received an honorary doctorate in literary studies in 2014 from Harvard University, was born with multiple sclerosis (MS), which affects around 7 million people worldwide. It causes weakness and numbness in muscles and joints. The disease can be treated with medication, but it can become debilitating and difficult to live with even if symptoms are controlled. In addition, research suggests that those with MS tend to experience reduced cognitive abilities during early life. That can make it hard for caregivers to understand why an individual may not want to work or play normally. While many families don't believe there's anything wrong with their children, others choose to hide them.

At the time of her diagnosis, Nicole had no idea what it meant until years later, when she learned that she would never again be able to walk without help. When asked whether she had ever considered telling her parents, she responded with a laugh, ""No.""

She continued:

My mom [said]: 'Are you sure?' And I didn't say yes, because this wasn't something I could talk about easily. It just came right up and hit me at once. But I knew that I needed to tell them. If someone told my sister-in-law, she'd probably go crazy with worry because she knows my situation as well. So, that gave me a lot of energy to think of my sister-in-law and ask her questions, like, 'Can you explain MS to me?' or 'What do I need to know about MS and how does it relate to my job?'

After she decided to disclose her condition to her employers, she recalled that ""it was really scary."" She added that she thinks she might have started to come out earlier than she should have, since she first became aware of her disability in 2013 and then after it took effect last year.

Nicole is now on disability pay, according to NPR's transcript, and is looking forward to continuing to write. At one point she joked, ""I'm gonna start taking some sort of medicine to increase my writing ability so I'll be able to get","Yes, there is a chance you could lose your job if you have MS.

How long does MS last?\r

MS can cause disability for decades after symptoms appear. You may experience problems with memory, concentration, balance, coordination, speech, vision, and hearing in adulthood. People with MS typically do not live past their 60s. What medications are available?\r

There are two types of anti-MS drugs (also called ""anti-CD3"") currently approved by FDA, which are used to treat relapsing forms of MS. In both cases, the drug slows down the progression of the disease. These therapies include: Glatiramer acetate (GlaxoSmithKline), which reduces the number of immune cells;

Zoledronic acid (Cymbalta); and

Lithium Sulfate (Lomustine). The first class of drugs is called immunosuppressive drugs because they prevent the body from producing natural antibodies. The second class of drugs is antifibers because they block the production of these antibodies. Both drugs are considered safe and well tolerated.\r

What kind of care is needed for MS patients? \r

The first step is to find out exactly what type of MS you have. It helps to consult an MS specialist in order to determine whether or not this is a form of the disease most likely to respond to standard therapy. Often, the diagnosis will involve some testing to confirm a diagnosis or, if you believe you might have another illness such as cancer, blood test or MRI scan. Once you know more about your specific case, you should make sure you have access to effective treatments. One way is to start a search on PubMed.com using the terms ""MS,"" ""relapsing"" and ""remitting."" Many people are surprised when they discover that many papers link MS with HIV. Another option is to visit your local clinic or hospital. Some clinics offer MS services like physical exams and medication management programs, while others don't. Your doctor will decide which one best fits your needs. They may also discuss potential benefits and risks. Ask","It depends on the type of MS. But at present, it is very rare in all the people I work with.

A: It doesn't affect me at all. I am a mother and grandmother to two boys now. My husband has been diagnosed with MS for almost 20 years. He came to us from California and we have always supported him in his battle against this disease. Now he's just starting to move into his senior year of college. At the end of each semester, when we celebrate our achievements and celebrate with family and friends in our home village, that is the first time the whole village sees me out of bed. There are so many other things to do in a person's daily routine. Even though I don't think about how many kids will grow up without fathers, it impacts every aspect of our lives — from our relationship with children to our relationships with family members and the community.

Q: Do you ever get nervous or stressed when visiting patients?

A: Not at all. If there is one thing I know for sure, it's that my husband would never want this disease to put him down. He knows what I go through and it makes me happy.","Your ability to work or perform your job will not be affected. You may get a few days of rest, but you can do whatever you want during that time. If your symptoms interfere with your daily life, you should see a health care professional immediately. This is the most common type of MS. However, it's also known as multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS). \r


Your immune system reacts against other substances in your body when they are exposed to these harmful substances - for example, sunlight, bacteria and viruses. When this happens, your immune system creates antibodies which attack those substances. These proteins bind to receptors on your nerve cells. The immune reaction causes pain, swelling and redness. Because you're trying to clear an infection, your immune system often sends out more than one kind of antibody. \r


The first type of MS causes no damage to your nerves. But if you develop MCS, the inflammation gets worse over time. The second type of MS causes trouble with movement and thinking, making it harder to concentrate and concentrating at all. In some people with this form of MS, the injury affects their entire nervous system; others have only part of the brain damaged. For these people, the damage is gradual. For others, there is no permanent change. You'll need treatment each time you get the disease because it can cause serious problems such as paralysis and blindness. After you've been treated successfully, you should never experience any disability from the disease again. \r


What if I have MS and I'm still working full-time?


If you have MS, you may want to consider whether the medical benefits offered by your employer could support your continuing employment. That depends upon your personal situation and what kind of insurance you have available. If you are unable to find any kind of coverage that pays your medical bills without affecting your job, contact your state or local human services department to find information about how to apply for help paying for your medicine.\r


If you qualify for coverage under an employee benefit plan, you might be eligible for Medicare, Medicaid, or a government program called the Supplemental Security Income Program (SSI) for low-income people with disabilities. If you have a spouse who is disabled and has similar income, you may qualify for SSI as well. Check with your state social security office to learn what programs are available in your area. Your employer must pay your premiums for SSI, but if you qualify, you can receive a federal subsidy to offset your premium. If","No.\r

""[P]erhaps, although MS does not always result from autoimmune inflammation, it certainly appears that many people with this disorder have some level of systemic inflammation. In addition, it should also be noted that patients with MS suffer from significant pain and disability without the involvement of functional impairment.

[RT I, 29.06.2012, 1 - entry into force 01.07.2013]

§ 769.1. Definitions

(1) For the purposes of this Act, the following definitions apply:

1) 'patient' means a person who is entitled to receive disability benefits under this Act or for other purposes under the Social Insurance System and includes any person with whom an application has been lodged under section 493 and also includes a child whose parents have applied under section 591.

2)'medical practitioner' means a doctor or a registered nurse or other medical professional authorised by law to practise medicine in Finland who is qualified by degrees to prescribe treatment and who treats people with disease or disabilities as their patient. Medical practitioners may also provide non-clinical care such as physical examinations, physiotherapy, occupational therapy or nutrition counselling, if the client's condition makes it necessary for these services to be provided to him/her.

3) 'physician' means a doctor or a registered nurse or other physician licensed under the law of a country where his profession exists and does not include doctors who are legally disqualified from practising medicine in that country due to lack of competence. A person who is a practicing physician shall not perform acts similar to those performed by the doctors mentioned in the first sentence without obtaining appropriate permission from the competent authority concerned. In particular he shall be subject to legal restrictions on access to patients which may vary according to the type of work performed. The practice of physicians in one or more countries may only continue after the conclusion of a reciprocal agreement between them and the European Union. This is referred to as a ""consultation"".

4) 'person' means a natural person, a resident of Estonia, a citizen of a state which belongs to the EU and also a permanent resident of Estonia who is covered by the social security system or a national of another Member State of the European Union or of the International Monetary Fund. The term includes a company incorporated in a foreign state.

5) 'prescribed treatment' means:

a) surgical treatment;

b) nursing care;

c) rehabilitation or training programmes in relation to rehabilitation (other than programmes organised through a health education programme);

d) medication;

e) psychosocial counseling; and

f) preventive or therapeutic measures (including emergency procedures).

6) 'treatment provider' means the person holding the prescribed treatment licence or who receives the","None.

A: You can use the questionnaire to find out what you or your family members have experienced, including symptoms that may be related to MS. For example, a person with fibromyalgia might report symptoms such as fatigue and joint pain when they are active in their daily activities. They might also report other symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, dizziness, or insomnia, that could indicate a more serious cause. If someone experiences these symptoms, ask about the possibility that it is an indication that something other than MS is causing them.


What else should I do if my health care provider tells me that there is no proof that I have MS?

The fact that the health care provider has told you that he or she cannot prove you have MS does not mean the patient's claims are false or unfounded. It means that there is insufficient evidence for a diagnosis or treatment decision at this time. Health care providers need to consider the credibility of their statements carefully before making any decisions regarding your medical treatments.

If your health care provider states that there is insufficient evidence for a diagnosis or treatment decision at this time, ask him or her how many individuals have been diagnosed with MS without supporting evidence. Most providers will state that there is only one case reported in peer-reviewed research literature that demonstrates that MS is associated with progressive muscle weakness, cognitive impairment, or motor loss (see Question 4 above). If your health care provider does not provide evidence that the disorder is linked to progressive muscle weakness, cognitive impairment, or motor loss, ask them to explain why such conclusions were made based on limited clinical experience.

Ask your health care provider whether he or she believes that there is enough scientific data to support a specific diagnostic test for MS. Your doctor will want to discuss any potential risks involved, including side effects such as loss of memory function or vision problems, long-term consequences, potential complications, and any benefits from using certain tests.


How do I decide whether to undergo a test to determine whether I have MS?

Your doctor may recommend one or several forms of testing for determining the presence or absence of MS. Some doctors also perform MRI scans to evaluate for signs of MS. In addition, some clinicians prescribe medications or inject substances into the spinal cord to treat symptoms of MS.


Is there a way for me to take steps to prevent future damage?

Yes. A number of strategies have been developed by researchers to limit the potential harm of MS. These include:

Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CB","A review of all the symptoms listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).\r

B: Symptoms for which no treatment is available. \r

C: The most common symptom of MS; a description of its severity, duration, and clinical features. \r

D: The most frequently occurring symptoms of MS; a description of their frequency, nature, significance, and treatment effects. \r

E: Some specific aspects of MS; an explanation or definition of these aspects.\r

F: What MS has been shown to do to an individual; what it causes, how it affects his health and functioning, and why he should be concerned about this disorder. \r

G: An analysis of current evidence in relation to the medical, social, economic, psychological, educational, legal, moral, and recreational aspects of MS; a discussion of relevant research findings; and recommendations based on this information.\r

H: A brief overview of other disorders that share similarities with MS. These include neuropsychiatric conditions such as anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, substance abuse, borderline personality disorder, and bipolar disorder.\r


\r

If you have any questions regarding your symptoms, please contact your physician by telephone or mail. If your physician does not respond within 10 days after receiving your request, you may refer yourself or one of your family members to another specialist who can evaluate your condition.\r

1C: Caffeine, coffee (or tea), alcohol, nicotine, prescription drugs, opiates (including heroin), sedatives (both hypnotic and non-hypnotic), stimulants/stimulant medications (e.g., amphetamine or cocaine), pain relievers (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen or acetaminophen) and vitamins such as vitamin E (folic acid) and A (ascorbate). If you have diabetes, take extra caution with sugar drinks (sucrose), which can lower blood glucose levels and cause insulin resistance.

2L: Lipid (fatty) acid balance. A healthy lipid profile may include a cholesterol level between 350 and 400 mg per deciliter (mg/dL); triglycerides at 2% to 5%; high blood pressure and heart disease risk factors such as hypertension; high fasting glucose (5 or higher mmol/L); metabolic syndrome; dyslipidemia; type II diabetes mellitus; abnormal liver function tests such as alanine aminotransferase; uric acid levels above 2; and low HDL cholesterol (<60 mg/dL). Low cholesterol is one of several markers for cardiovascular disease. High LDL cholesterol is an independent marker for the development of atherosclerotic plaque in arteries that supply blood to the heart.

3M: Moderate weight gain during pregnancy or breastfeeding. This condition also commonly occurs after menopause when excess body fat accumulates around the neck and upper back, especially if your size is relatively small. It usually appears in childhood, but it can occur later in life. You should check with your doctor first to confirm this disorder before starting any diet changes or exercise program.

4N: Nerve conduction disturbances in people who suffer from Parkinson's Disease. Symptoms might include tremors, disorientation, memory loss, slowness of movement, muscle rigidity, tingling sensations and paralysis. If you are not able to move and feel unwell, contact your doctor immediately.

5O: Osteopenia. An imbalance of calcium and phosphorus in bones, leading to weakening or brittle joints. Your osteopenia could lead to fractures. If this happens to you, try to reduce your protein intake by consuming foods fortified with folic acid and/or calcium.","Yes, I had 2 or more MS symptoms.

Q: What was your diagnosis before you started treatment?

(a) Acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

(b) Mucosal atrophy with diffuse axonal loss.

(c) Multiple sclerosis (MS), which includes both primary and secondary forms.

(d) Neurological disorders that do not meet the definition of any of these conditions (see list below).

(e) Surgical or psychiatric diseases.

(f) A combination of any two of the following.


(1) Brain tumors, cysts, or malignant tumors that have affected at least one major organ of the body (brain, spinal cord, etc.).

(2) A medical condition that causes the disease to be progressive or disabling.

(3) Any other medically determinable physical or mental impairment that interferes with a person's ability to perform at least some activities of daily living.

(g) Multiple sclerosis (MS), which is a chronic relapsing-remitting disease of central nervous system (CNS) origin that affects millions of people worldwide. This disease has no known cure. In most cases, it results in paralysis and/or weakness affecting 10 percent or more of each limb. It usually begins between ages 20 and 50. People may develop multiple sclerosis by accident, aging, infection, trauma, or injury; however, it is often triggered by an underlying immune disorder. About 1.8 million Americans are diagnosed with MS every year. The vast majority experience symptoms during their teens and early twenties. Those who do not have any symptoms tend to respond well to medication and surgery. For some, the onset occurs shortly after birth but others begin as young as age 5. There are several types of MS. Primary (non-reactive) MS is the most common type of MS, affecting about 80 percent of the population. Secondary (responsive) MS is characterized by milder forms of the disease, such as focal neurologic deficit, optic neuritis, spasticity, and tics.

Q: How many patients have been treated for MS?

There is currently only one FDA-approved therapy for MS. Oral sulindac, an oral formulation of levetiracetam, is approved as an adjunctive treatment for the treatment of moderate to severe relapses of MS and occasionally for refractory non-relapse MS. Sustained-release formulations","Some people can have symptoms that are not listed.

Q: What is a ""cytokine""? A: Cytokines are proteins which act as messengers, and their primary function is to regulate cell activity, repair tissue damage or promote healing. Cytokines are found in the body and they may be released by cells when they are damaged, stressed, or activated (for example, during an infection). The word cyto is Greek for ""one"" and it's used to describe the cellular type of the substance.


Cytokines also help regulate immune system responses, and contribute to immune response and disease pathogenesis, so many people with MS experience inflammation in the brain. This is why some people develop fatigue, pain, weakness, and loss of memory, vision and hearing. Other causes of CNS inflammation include infections, bacterial infection, HIV/AIDS, viral infections such as pneumonia, herpes, and other viruses, and tumors.","What do you mean? I don't know what you mean. It's just that it says you have MS and it has to be diagnosed at some point, so if it can't be diagnosed yet or not identified until later in life, then you should probably get into a lot more treatment for things like pain.""

""So, you're saying that patients with MS who are already having their symptoms improved because they were being treated with steroids, which is exactly the wrong approach?""

The doctor nodded. ""It is true that people with MS can get better on medication. But this doesn't always happen. And often, it does not happen when your condition is stable enough to tolerate it, because sometimes there isn't even good evidence that your conditions are improving at all.""

There are no drugs approved by the FDA that specifically treat MS, said Dr. Mark Wannamaker, an endocrinologist at Harvard Medical School. The drug that was used to control his MS — the first one available — stopped working after six months of use. He now takes steroid injections three times a week to help manage his symptoms.

He thinks he would be fine without these treatments. ""I'm pretty sure I'd still be going through the same motions as before,"" he told me. ""But the problem with those medications, especially if they haven't been proven effective, is that they become side effects once they've gone off. So once we start using them, our health deteriorates further.""

What's worse, according to many experts, steroids also may cause serious long-term damage to body cells, including causing cancer in people over 50. ""Steroids will increase inflammation, which increases risk of cancer,"" explained Michael Rosenbaum, chief executive officer of Proviron Inc., based in New York City. ""They will make the immune system hyperactive, leading to inflammation, and, ultimately, cancer.""

Another reason doctors aren't prescribing steroids to treat MS, according to Rosenbaum, is that ""there's a lack of understanding about how the body responds to steroids. Many physicians and scientists think that steroids work by stimulating the production of certain hormones, but that hasn't really been shown in research studies. So it's unclear how well [steroid] therapies work and whether there are any negative side effects.""

Doctors say they need new treatment options to keep up with the mounting demands of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. They also want to provide better care to patients who have the most severe forms","What causes MS?

The above listing is not comprehensive. There are many diseases that go undiagnosed or untreated. This article will attempt to give an overview of the major problems associated with the disease, its effects on mental health, and the ways it can be treated. The following information will not replace professional medical care; if you want to get some help for your condition, it's best to see a qualified doctor.

[7] How does MS affect my family members?

Mild to moderate forms of MS are easily treatable by medication. Symptoms typically improve within months but it may take up to 3 years before full recovery occurs. Moderate to severe forms of MS are difficult to manage by medications alone but can be managed with appropriate lifestyle changes such as exercise and eating right.


If you have any type of chronic illness you should talk to your physician about potential treatment options. Your doctor will work with your insurance company to determine what kind of treatment may be available for your particular situation. You'll need to decide if your conditions make you more vulnerable than others. Is there something else we can do to protect ourselves from harm?

Treating MS symptoms

How long should I wait between episodes?

MS symptoms usually begin slowly, most people experience one episode during their lifetime (typically every two to five years). Most sufferers experience at least one episode each month. The exact time between each attack varies depending on individual factors like age, severity of the disease, genetic predisposition, and other risk factors. However, in general, people who live longer tend to experience fewer attacks. Also, having MS for 30 years seems to decrease a person's likelihood of experiencing another attack.

What is a remission period?

It takes around 6-8 weeks after taking a single dose of medicine to see signs of improvement. While this is certainly better than waiting until you have an attack, it's still far too long. Although patients can expect to continue to experience improvements through the first year or so after starting to use a new drug, they're unlikely to fully recover in less than 12 months. For many people, relapse after a few months often makes the process even harder. Since there are no drugs specifically designed to increase blood flow to the brain, medicines must be taken daily to avoid damaging the nerves or causing","No. The MS symptom list is a useful way to find information related to MS, but it can be used by anyone who has an MS diagnosis and has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. It is not the only source of information about your MS. See: Multiple Sclerosis Symptoms and Diagnosis

MS-Specific Tests for a Specific Condition

The following tests are not specific for MS or any other chronic condition (except for some medications). They may help you determine if your health problem is due to MS, but they cannot diagnose or treat MS or help you manage other conditions. They will help you understand what is wrong and how to correct it. For more details on these tests, see: Multiple Sclerosis Disease Screening Test

CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE TESTING

Tests for Cervical Spinal Cord Injuries

You will need one or both cervical spine exams (spine X-rays) every 6 months during the first year after you stop using your prescription contraceptive pills to monitor your progress toward normal functioning. You should continue having these exams until you have had no further abnormal changes in your spine. A total of three exams may be done at different times throughout the course of the disease; however, the doctor must do two of them during each 5-year cycle. If you use combined oral contraceptives (contraceptives containing estrogen, progestin, male hormones or another hormone), the third exam may be done less frequently.

For women ages 18 through 49 years old, a cervical spine exam occurs when your cervix is gently pressed between the upper ribs. This is most often done within 1 week after stopping your pill and may require several additional sessions.

For men ages 18 through 49 years old, a cervical spine exam occurs when your penis is rubbed against the side of your neck while standing up and touching the top part of your head. The examination also involves rubbing your penis against the lower part of your neck. The procedure may also involve the use of an applicator that extends across the back of the neck, making contact with the top part of your head to feel for swelling and other abnormalities. In addition, a physician may use a special instrument called a ""pelvic floor muscle"" to examine this area of the body to detect spinal cord injury. A total of three pelvic floor muscle examinations occur at least once per year.

To test for cervical spine injuries, go directly to the appropriate link below:","A list of common MS symptoms that include, but are not limited to: pain in your hands or feet; muscle weakness, stiffness and tiredness; fatigue and changes in appetite; problems with balance, vision and balance; numbness, tingling and/or hot flashes; blurred vision and eye pain; difficulty swallowing or speaking; loss of hearing.

What causes multiple sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis occurs when the immune system attacks healthy tissue in the body, causing inflammation, swelling and other signs and symptoms. It is usually found at an early age (usually before 5 years) during childhood or adolescence. Some studies show that as many as 70% of people who develop MS have it before they reach age 15. The exact cause is unknown, but research suggests some factors may play a role. This includes exposure to certain chemicals or substances from vaccines, environmental exposures such as smoking, autoimmune diseases, chemotherapy drugs like prednisone and steroids and radiation treatment. However, the actual number of cases remains unclear because of several reasons. First, most tests for multiple sclerosis are performed on adults, which means children don't often get tested for this condition. Secondly, these tests look for specific abnormalities in the brain rather than at the whole body, so they're less likely to detect more subtle changes that occur over time. Most of the testing done today is ""test-based,"" meaning doctors use MRI scans to determine if someone has MS. While this is helpful, there's no way of knowing how accurately such images represent what actually happens inside the brain. And even the best MRI machines can only see parts of the brain, leaving out important parts that could be involved in MS. There's also a high rate of false positives - patients diagnosed with MS after a scan turn out to actually have another disease. Finally, new imaging methods are being developed that would allow doctors to see more complex patterns of brain activity, which could lead to more accurate diagnosis of MS. As part of its multiyear study of different treatments for multiple sclerosis, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society conducted a study where researchers used fMRI technology to test whether different types of therapy might help improve MS symptoms. In their results, researchers concluded that combining a low dose of corticosteroids with exercise led to improvements in the number of functional MRI images taken per day. They also found that these treatments were effective against more severe forms of MS, such as relapsing-remitting MS, so further research into them is needed. This type of research isn't available for adults, but it does point toward"
72,Q: Is the Covid-19 vaccine safe for people taking multiple sclerosis drugs?\nA:,"No. It was developed with a different vaccine, called Cervarix. There is not enough evidence to suggest that it's safer than the other two vaccines currently available. In fact, some studies have shown that it may be harmful if taken over long periods of time and by certain individuals. So, it should be used only under close supervision by an experienced health care provider. \r

See FAQs about the Covid-19 vaccine at http://www.vaccinesafety.org/medical-conditions/acute-paralysis/. [12] A study conducted in Italy suggested that there is a link between vaccination with the Hib vaccine (Hib) and cervical cancer as well as HIV infection.\nA: The HPV vaccine is effective against most strains of HPV and it protects against all types of cervical cancer, including precancerous cancers like premenopausal or postmenopausal. However, more research must be done on whether the HPV vaccine will protect against cancer caused by other types of HPV, which do exist within the human body. Although there are no data suggesting any increased risk of cervical cancer from HPV infections, it could increase the risk of developing some other diseases such as penile cancer and anal cancer, particularly for young men who take the HPV vaccine regularly. In addition, it has been suggested that women infected with a type of HPV known as 631(G), which may also cause genital warts, should consider getting vaccinated against it in order to reduce their chance of contracting this disease. To learn more about the risks associated with HPV, go to HPV and Cancer. [13] A review of 13 published epidemiological studies suggests that male circumcision reduces the risk of contracting herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2). It also prevents transmission of HPV and HSV-1. However, the reasons why circumcision can prevent HSV-2 transmission are unclear. Also, there are conflicting reports regarding whether the benefits of circumcision outweigh the potential harms of circumcision. For example, one study indicated that men circumcised as adults had lower rates of contracting HIV than uncircumcised males. This finding does not prove that circumcision causes reduced risk of HIV infection, but rather supports the theory that circumcision might slow the spread of a sexually transmitted infection or a group of viruses known as ""herpesviruses."" There is also a possible connection between the circumcision and the spread of chlamydia. Some researchers hypothesize that circumcision reduces the number of sex partners and thus increases susceptibility to transmitting STIs. However, others note that circumcised","No, there is no evidence that it's safe to take at higher doses over a long period of time. A recent study found that patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) were more likely than controls to have suffered serious side effects from taking multiple sclerosis medicines in addition to taking C3P. However, this was not due to any higher risk of severe reactions in people taking MS medicines. There are also some people who don't develop symptoms after taking MS medicines, but might develop mild side effects. It could be possible that you are still developing an attack and haven't fully recovered yet, so your immune system isn't ready to fight off new attacks. You should talk to your GP or pharmacist about which combination of drugs may help you. Q: Is the Covid-20 vaccine safe for children? \nA: The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which tracks reports of adverse events associated with vaccines administered to US children between 1998 and 2013, shows that the Covid-20 vaccination was linked with 2 reported deaths among 10 children under 12 years of age. VAERS data show that these two cases occurred within a year after the vaccine had been licensed. If there has been a problem with this product, please let us know by calling 1-800-822-0038. For information on reporting adverse events related to other vaccines, including the Hib shot, see http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety. Q: How often do I need to get vaccinated with HPV vaccines? \nA: Most women aged 19 to 50 can receive up to 3 doses of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine before their next period; however, if you're older than 50, you'll need to make sure you've got a full series. This includes both the quadrivalent HPV4 (types 6, 11, 16, 18) and quadrivalent HPV6 (types 4, 5, 7, 13). It also covers types 17 and 18. Your doctor will usually recommend a dose of either type 4 or type 8 after each cycle, depending on your level of immunity. As well as HPV, Gardasil contains around 250 different strains of viruses, including 9 types of herpes simplex virus, including HSV1 and HSV2. Women who've had sex during their lifetime, whether vaginal or anal, or if they've ever given birth, have a much higher chance of getting genital herpes compared with those who haven't. To prevent genital herpes, avoid all sexual contact until","This question is not an accurate assessment of the safety profile of the vaccine because it does not consider that the immune response to a drug may be modulated by the vaccination dose, or even if there are any differences in the antibody responses. We cannot predict, with any degree of certainty, how long this vaccine will last for all patients who receive their first dose; however, we have seen no evidence of adverse reactions to any of our initial doses.

Other questions about vaccines and immunization include: Are there risks from ""live"" viruses, such as those generated from the human papillomavirus (HPV) infection? \nA: This has been studied extensively and results appear to show some risk to children exposed to live virus vaccines. However, these studies were done on different types of HPV strains and populations, so they cannot determine whether the exposure was related to HPV infection or not. In addition, the findings of this study did not address the relationship between live virus vaccine exposure and other diseases, including autoimmune disorders.

Do you recommend a low-dose measles vaccine to prevent measles in adults?\nA: The AAP recommends four MMR vaccinations at least 30 days apart, regardless of age group. If vaccinated within three weeks after onset of symptoms, infants aged 6 months through 11 years should receive two doses of MMR vaccine every year until age 18 months. For most older adolescents, two doses of MMR vaccine should be administered annually during childhood, followed by one dose when the adolescent reaches school entry age.\n

What is your recommendation regarding oral polio vaccine? Does the vaccine cause paralysis or death?\nA: No causal association has been demonstrated between the use of OPV and paralytic poliomyelitis. There is no data showing that OPV can be used to protect against poliomyelitis due to lack of protective immunity.\n

Why do parents opt for homeopathic medical care instead of seeing an MD? How effective is homeopathy compared with traditional treatments? Do homeopathic medicines work differently than conventional drugs? Can homeopathy replace conventional medicine? What type of treatment should parents see before deciding whether homeopathy would be right for them?\nA: Homeopathy is based upon the principle that substances, in nature, have properties that can be manipulated to create more desirable health outcomes by adjusting dosage, frequency and duration of administration, pH, dilution, strength, etc. To date, there has been little research into homeopathy's effectiveness as compared to conventional medicine.

Vaccines do not protect against all forms of MS, but they can help reduce symptoms and improve quality of life. For more information on how to get this type of disease under control, click here. \r

The best way to avoid getting MS is to start your treatment at a young age. The sooner you are diagnosed with MS the better your chances will be of controlling it effectively. You don't need to wait until you're 45 to begin treatment. See our brochure, ""How to Treat MS Naturally"".\r

Can I get a vaccine for measles?\r

Yes. MMR is available in over 400 countries. Some countries have mandatory vaccination requirements that require adults aged 16 years or older to get vaccinated by the time they reach 18 years old. In some countries, such as Germany, Finland, Spain, and Italy, children must also receive measles immunity before they turn 12 years old. To find out if you might be eligible to get the MMR vaccine, go to our Vaccine Information section.\r

Why aren't vaccines recommended for people who've had an earlier diagnosis of mumps, rubella, chickenpox, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, polio, whooping cough, or any other childhood illness?\r

CDC recommends that everyone get two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine when they are 6 months old and again during childhood. This schedule helps prevent serious complications from these diseases, which include pneumonia, encephalitis (brain inflammation), severe ear infections, meningitis (inflammation of the lining of the brain), seizures, paralysis, death, and chronic health problems.\r

What does the CDC recommend for kids whose parents can't afford the vaccinations?\r

To lower costs for families making the decision to vaccinate their child, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides free immunization services through their Healthy Kids program. If you qualify for free care, you may enroll your child in either one of two immunization classes offered at the local public school or community college. Your child's health insurance provider would cover the cost of immunizations if he/she is eligible for Medicaid, Medi-Cal, Medicare, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), or other government programs. All other parents should contact their private providers to learn about immunization options that may work well for them. Learn more about Immun","No. The vaccines are administered at a higher dose than what is required to reduce symptoms.


Q: If I am allergic, do you suggest that I avoid the Covid-19 product?\nA: Yes, it is highly recommended that people with anaphylactic reactions take medication such as epinephrine or other injectable epinephrine. We recommend that people who have been diagnosed with an allergy to any component of the Covid-19 vaccine use epinephrine and another form of treatment that can control their symptoms if necessary.\nA: See page 21 for more information about how to identify a potential allergy in your child.

It is a very effective treatment, and has been successfully used in treating severe MS patients with relapsing remitting disease who have failed other treatments. The safety of this drug is supported by research published by WHO in 2001 which showed that the anti-S1 antibody CXCR4 was strongly associated with long term benefit. There are no data to show that this drug should be used to treat MS patients taking other medications or as a result of surgery that can affect MS symptoms such as pain or stiffness, and there are no data on whether it causes any side effects. If you think you might have MS then see your doctor before taking this drug. \r

Q: What information do I need to take if I have taken a Covid-19 vaccine containing two serotypes of S1V?\nA: People have reported an increased risk of thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders following administration of this vaccine, but these cases were not consistent with a causal relationship between the vaccination and thrombolytic activity. However, further studies are needed to establish the true incidence of these adverse events. \r

Q: Can corticosteroids protect against HIV infection?\nA: Corticosteroid use reduces the severity of HIV infection. Some evidence suggests that corticosteroids may reduce the ability of HIV to replicate within the body and cause damage. When taken together with antiretroviral therapy (ART), there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend their use in combination with ART alone. Although the effect of combining corticosteroids and ART on reducing the risk of AIDS progression remains unclear, they may reduce the risks of opportunistic infections like malaria and pneumonia. In addition, they may prevent relapse in people who take ART and are at higher risk of re-infection. Further investigation into how the use of steroids affects the immune system is warranted. \r

Q: Are corticosteroids harmful to children or pregnant women?\nA: This question is complex and there is currently limited knowledge about potential adverse effects of corticosteroids on pregnancy. Therefore, corticosteroids are not recommended during pregnancy. \r

Q: Are there differences in response to corticosteroids among different ethnic groups?\nA: There is some concern regarding the use of corticosteroids by certain ethnic groups in developed countries. Corticosteroids have been shown to increase the rate of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in African American populations and a","It is considered to be highly effective and may have a modest but significant protective effect.\r

Q: What are the clinical benefits of the Covid-19 vaccine?

A: The vaccine has been shown to reduce disability, but it is unknown whether this benefit extends to those with MS who are not on a regimen of medications. In addition, the vaccine does not prevent all progression and relapse; thus, persons in which there is no evidence of progressive disease should continue receiving their current treatment.

\r

What if I don't respond to the Vaccine?

If you do not respond to the vaccine within six months after vaccination, your doctor will recommend that you receive another dose, usually within one year. If you do not respond to two doses or more after a single vaccination, your doctor will suggest you receive additional vaccinations as needed to prevent further damage or delay onset of symptoms. (See ""Vaccines"" section below.)

In some cases, patients may experience adverse reactions to vaccines during their lifetime, especially among children. For these reasons, health care providers consider it important to obtain a complete medical history before administering any type of vaccine. You can ask your healthcare provider how frequently such side effects occur in relation to each dose, and also when they might occur.

For example, your doctor may want to know about any recent changes in weight, blood pressure, or cholesterol levels, along with other known risk factors associated with autoimmune diseases. He may also want to check for any allergy to common ingredients used in the vaccines (such as egg protein). When possible, your doctor's decision-maker will ask you for a copy of any family medical history or laboratory test results, particularly if the information relates to an immunization that is given to someone younger than 18 years old. This includes the following questions: \r

Have you had any allergies to foods, medicines, plants, insects, animals, or other substances? \r

Are you allergic to latex or latex gloves? \r

Do you have any history of asthma, hay fever, eczema, sinusitis, or any skin conditions? \r

Has anyone ever mentioned anything about any allergies to food, medication, or chemicals? \r

How long ago were you diagnosed with either mumps, rubella, measles, pertussis, varicella, or chicken pox? Is this new information relevant to your condition? \r

Is there something else that you think we","No. The vaccine is only effective in those with active MS and has no effect on patients who have not had previous disease or who are not taking medications for MS.

Q: Does the vaccine work against HIV/AIDS? \nA: Yes, it works to a certain degree against HIV\r

Q: Is there any risk of side effects from the vaccine? \nA: There is no evidence that the vaccine poses an increased risk of adverse events due to immunization with the vaccine itself, nor do we believe that the potential risks posed by immune cells (such as CD4) will be significant enough to alter patient outcomes based on immunization. However, if you experience an allergic reaction after receiving the vaccine, consult your health care provider immediately.

Q: Can I get the vaccine even if I am infected with HIV? \nA: You can receive this vaccine regardless of whether you have been diagnosed with HIV infection.\r

Q: How long does the vaccination last? \nA: For most adults, the duration of protection is usually approximately three years. For children, it may take longer. If the vaccine contains live viral particles, then the vaccine should be administered within two weeks of exposure. In rare cases, such as for injection using disposable syringes during surgery, children may require up to four months' immunity. Children under 12 months are generally protected until the age of 16.

Q: What's the difference between the vaccines used in the U.S.? \nA: Both doses of this vaccine contain live virus. This protects children and adults alike from contracting an infectious disease caused by viruses like measles and mumps.\r

Q: How is the vaccine licensed? \nA: The CDC's Division of Biological Standards approves vaccine candidates through a process called clinical development.\r

Q: What happens when the vaccine becomes available? \nA: When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gives the go-ahead for one of these vaccines to be produced, production begins at a plant in Florida.\r

Q: How many people would need to be vaccinated before the vaccine became widely available? \nA: Based on data provided by CDC officials, the average number of vaccinations required to protect children without HIV is currently around 1,500.\r

Q: Do parents need to consider vaccinating their kids? \nA: Most likely they won't. Parents are encouraged to discuss vaccine options with their child's","No.

Q: How do I know that vaccines are safe for children with autism and other health problems?\nA: We believe we have demonstrated this safety in animals. See below, ""Vaccine Safety Studies in Animals"".

Q: If I receive a vaccination against influenza, should I be concerned if my child is sick or has been hospitalized because of the flu? \nA: Yes, you may want to call your doctor right away and discuss the risks associated with vaccines. However, most strains of influenza viruses can cause mild illness without serious complications. Most people recover from such viral illnesses within two days. For more information about this topic, visit the CDC's website at http://www.cdc.gov/flu/.

Q: Why does my child get a flu shot even though he's not contagious with it?\nA: The flu virus is very infectious before its symptoms develop and spread easily through the air. Before these symptoms occur, the flu virus will usually start to replicate inside your body. After the symptoms do appear, the flu virus will either die or enter dormant mode. This means the virus will continue to multiply but will never reproduce again so there won't be any risk of infection after the symptoms occur. So while you might think you're getting a flu shot, the chances are that your child isn't actually transmitting the flu to others.

Q: Where can I find information on how to protect myself from being exposed to the flu during an outbreak? Can I just buy a spray bottle and wear it around me all summer long? Or what should I wear under my clothes when I'm outdoors?\nA: Here's some helpful advice: Wear long sleeves and pants (and boots if necessary) and stay out of water. Wash frequently with soap and cool running water. Do not go swimming. Avoid contact with surfaces where germs could be present. Use hand sanitizers if possible, especially as soon as a rash appears. Wear goggles when outdoors. Remember, however, that these are only guidelines. A good rule of thumb is to wear shorts and socks indoors at least 20 minutes a day, then cover up in layers of clothing and use them outdoors only if absolutely necessary. In general, avoid getting too close to plants, pets, and children; don't feed or drink anything they touch; don't leave food out unattended; and keep well away from large crowds or crowded places. To learn more about preventing the spread of disease by keeping yourself healthy, see our"
77,Q: How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?\nA:,"A recent study (McDonald et al., 2003) showed a significant association between MS and the occurrence of menstrual irregularity. There is some debate about whether this finding is cause or effect, but it does seem that menstruation has an impact on the risk of developing multiple sclerosis. On the other hand, it could be argued that women who have had frequent periods in childhood and adolescence may be at greater risk for MS than those without such histories, as their reproductive biology may predispose them to increased risk of disease development. The results are based upon a cohort of patients with a diagnosis of MS, and there is not enough data from this group to prove causation. More research is needed. \nB: What are the clinical implications for MS? When should patients begin treatment? \nC: Should women be excluded from treatment?\nD: Does MS increase the risk of breast cancer or ovarian cancer? \nE: What are the possible reasons why women with MS might have more frequent menstrual cycles? \nF: Do these findings apply to others with MS who also suffer from amenorrhea?\nG: Are there any potential causes for this relationship? \nH: Is this phenomenon common among women with MS, as well as women with migraine headaches or fibromyalgia?\nI: Why are many women with MS taking hormone replacement therapy? \nJ: Where can I get more information on menstrual cycle abnormalities?","It's not as simple as you might think. A woman with MS may have more or less of the same symptoms as a woman who has never had MS, but she will also be at an increased risk for MS-related neurologic disease and disability. There is no one cause for women's more frequent onset of MS symptoms, and there are many factors that contribute to this.

What if I'm worried about my health after having been diagnosed with MS?

It can take several years before you know for sure whether your health problems are caused by MS or other medical conditions. In most cases, it is safe to continue working and enjoying life.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory condition in which the immune system attacks and destroys healthy tissue. Menopause may be one of the many symptoms that include increased fatigue, memory loss, joint pain and weakness. In MS, menstruation, breast milk production and reproductive functions are all affected by the disease, although some women respond favorably to treatment with estrogen or progesterone. However, there is no scientific evidence linking MS symptoms with menopausal symptomatology such as hot flashes, hot flushes, insomnia and mood swings. Instead, researchers believe this relationship is related to an imbalance between estrogen-like substances and testosterone-like compounds in the brain and spinal cord. Since these ""male hormones"" control sex drive and sexual behavior, it makes sense that menstrual cycles might play a role.

Source(s):

Melissa · 9 years ago","Many MS patients have a significant reduction in immune response, but there is also an increase in inflammatory markers. It's not the same thing as MS-specific disease because the immune system is different from MS. There are some people who have a marked decrease in their immune function and others with increased numbers of cells or inflammation that may be associated with MS symptoms. The only way to know for sure is to get blood tests.

About MS

MS is a progressive, disabling disease that affects more than 250 million Americans and affects about one-third of all adults over age 65. It is often fatal when left untreated or inadequately treated. The average disability cost for people with MS has been estimated at $92 billion annually. About half of those costs come from healthcare expenses; the remainder comes from lost productivity and other losses associated with illness.

Although it is rare, some people who have MS develop an autoimmune disorder known as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Rheumatoid arthritis occurs most commonly in children aged 6 through 18 years old. RA can result in pain on both sides of the body, fatigue, joint swelling, loss of appetite and weight gain, joint deformity, muscle weakness, blurred vision, difficulty walking, night blindness and impaired thinking. People who carry the mutated gene responsible for developing RA can also develop another form of the disease called sporadic rheumatoid arthritis (SRA). Both forms can cause serious complications including bone marrow failure and organ damage, skin diseases, and nerve disorders. In both cases, doctors treat the underlying causes of the disease by removing the affected cells and then transplanting them into healthy tissue.","The relationship between MS and multiple sclerosis symptoms is complex. While many people with MS have MS-related symptoms, some people who have MS-like symptoms may not have any of the other MS characteristics or be at risk for having MS-like symptoms.

About 50% to 60% of women with MS are also diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD affects about 1 in 30,000 females. Menopause can increase the likelihood that someone will develop IBD as well. Women with MS experience a higher rate of gastrointestinal symptoms when compared to their non-MS counterparts. Additionally, studies show that this increased risk may extend to both menopausal and post-menopausal populations. People who have a history of IBD have a greater chance of developing MS than those without. For more information on IBD and MS symptoms, please see our article on IBD Symptoms.

It is a different disease. Multiple sclerosis affects the central nervous system, specifically in the brain and spinal cord. People with MS get headaches, fatigue, pain, muscle aches, neck stiffness, and more. Some people report nausea or vomiting, but they don't necessarily know what it means. However, most people with MS feel their pain, so the pain can be mistaken for other things like fatigue, migraines, and other symptoms of MS. But women who have had an early pregnancy may experience postpartum depression that gets worse over time and causes her to become depressed during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, which makes it harder to manage treatment. She also has difficulty sleeping at night and has trouble concentrating on tasks such as reading or writing. Most doctors will say she should try medications for depression first before trying to treat MS. Q: What do women with MS find difficult about having children? \nA: Many women report that finding work is hard because they don't want to leave home. This is especially true if the woman wants a career, rather than taking care of kids. The stigma associated with childbearing is even tougher for them. I used to think being a mom was great, until I got pregnant again. Now I worry that someday I won't be able to make ends meet if I'm working full-time. I am grateful that my husband works part-time and cares for our three daughters, but he doesn't live with me all that much anymore, and we're lucky because his family provides support. My daughter, however, still feels pressured to take care of him while he's away from us. He spends quite a bit of time at work, so there's no way I'll ever catch up with him financially without help. The stress is starting to break down our marriage, and I fear this will continue unless I start talking with him more often about my situation, since he hasn't been around nearly enough. We've tried counseling, but the sessions were too depressing to keep me going. When I try to talk about my life with him, the last thing he says is ""You're making more money now than you did back when you started dating."" That's when he tells me he thinks he knows everything there is to know about me, and doesn't realize how many people hate me because of it. So I stay silent. Even though the doctor told us we might need a new baby, I figured he would just let me have one year of parenthood,","Symptoms of MS are related and overlapping. Multiple sclerosis has a common pathophysiology, and many of the same medical conditions that cause MS also occur in women who have multiple sclerosis. For example, multiple sclerosis can be caused by autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus (Lyme disease) or rheumatoid arthritis. This is especially true for those patients with fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome. If you suffer from MS symptoms but don't have MS-related symptoms, then it's important to get tested for all these illnesses before you start taking medications to treat them.

How does multiple sclerosis affect a woman during her menstrual cycle?

The menstrual cycle affects many aspects of your body, including what hormones you're exposed to throughout your cycle. Many experts believe that multiple sclerosis can cause changes in your brain cells, which makes it difficult for you to experience pain while using certain drugs. However, studies have shown that some medications may not change the amount of estrogen or progesterone found in your blood, making treatment more likely to work.","It's very hard for a woman to know if she is experiencing MS because it's such an underreported condition. I think that women are in the minority of people who report MS. I had one patient who reported symptoms similar to those observed in other patients with MS. The symptoms included headache, fatigue, nausea, and night sweats. She also reported visual disturbances and blurred vision. There was no history of depression or anxiety before she developed these symptoms. I'm not sure what her diagnosis was, but she said that she didn't feel like herself when she left work early at night. I would assume that this is related to the fact that many people have trouble leaving their homes due to MS and that may be why her problems persisted throughout her pregnancy. What I suspect is happening here is that her brain has been damaged by MS, so there is some kind of damage occurring that may be causing her to experience various symptoms that occur during pregnancy.

There are a number of common symptoms seen in MS that don't manifest themselves as MS symptoms, such as pain in your joints or back, weight loss, joint stiffness, or numbness or tingling in your hands, feet, arms, legs, or genitals. Some people will develop these things after they've gotten used to living with MS, while others will start developing them suddenly and without any warning, which may indicate that you're starting MS. If you're having headaches, you should see your doctor right away. As a general rule, if you're noticing any unusual changes in your moods, or you notice anything amiss with your energy level or sleeping patterns, or if you have unexplained weight gain, ask your physician about possible symptoms that could be caused by MS.","The symptoms of MS are very similar. There is a common theme in both that the patient experiences worsening of all or most, if not all symptoms within 4-6 weeks after starting treatment with an FDA approved MS medication. The overall improvement experienced by women following therapy for MS appears to be more than 80% when compared to that experienced by men. MS does not respond well to anti-convulsants and so those who have had this kind of effect will need to continue with treatment until they show significant improvement.\nB\NBER Clinical Trial Registry\r

79,Q: Can I pass multiple sclerosis to other family members?\nA:,"Yes. You can, provided you're not in a situation where one of the children has an infection or is having seizures or something like that and then you want to take him or her into the hospital. But generally speaking, we don't recommend it.""

Hospitals will usually try to keep the disease from spreading by isolating families with MS and keeping them isolated for up to seven days at a time while they receive treatment. The Mayo Clinic recommends avoiding contact between relatives of patients who have the illness and their caregivers -- but does admit it might be possible to make arrangements so relatives are able to see each other without being closely monitored.

As the disease progresses, there's a risk of the immune system attacking some parts of the body more aggressively than others. Some people develop severe joint pain or stiffness that can spread to other areas of the body. In rare cases, MS causes paralysis of the lower limbs. There are no effective treatments for those conditions.

The CDC says most people with MS are cured within two years after diagnosis. For those who cannot tolerate standard treatment, many hospitals offer experimental drugs such as cyclosporine (see sidebar).","No, you cannot. You can't legally do it because there's no proof that your condition is similar to the disease of another person. If you have a child with MS who does not know their parents' history, they will not recognize this as MS (multiple sclerosis). Your children may be able to get a diagnosis through tests or blood work only if they are in school and have an understanding about the disorder. If you want to give up MS and go back to normalcy, do so when you have time. In some cases, family members may need more help than others. There are many resources available at your local hospital or health clinic, including medical clinics. A doctor who specializes in MS can recommend treatment for patients with this disorder.\nThere's also the option of taking medicine by mouth called oral steroids that might ease symptoms. The use of oral medication for someone with MS is not recommended because it has side effects such as diarrhea or heartburn, and some people can develop serious infection.\nIn addition, medications can interact with each other or cause side effects such as dizziness, nausea, or vomiting. They should not be taken together. If your son takes medication on top of his regular regimen of medicines to control MS, he may experience a higher risk of developing MS later on. For example, if he gets a high dose of insulin daily, the body could begin producing too much of this hormone and causing problems, such as seizures. If your son takes medication regularly, he won't need any special precautions, but he must follow instructions carefully. This means that he must avoid alcohol and drugs that would make him sick.

Treating Multiple Sclerosis

If your child starts to have trouble walking, then try to keep moving and talk to him. He will probably start to lose strength and stop breathing. Ask your pediatrician about ways you can treat MS. You can also ask if he needs physical therapy or see an occupational therapist to assist him. Once a child learns how to walk again, he can continue to stay active and even play sports like soccer or football. Some kids with MS who never had MS before may still need treatments and rehabilitation.

Remember to tell all parents about your decision. It will let them know what to expect and may improve communication between you two.

Be sure to discuss treatment options with your child's healthcare provider, particularly if they're used on older children or teens. Talk to your child's primary care physician before deciding whether to take these measures.","No, it's not okay to share your MS with anyone else. You have to wait until you're physically and emotionally ready to talk about it with someone who has no idea of the severity or the impact of your disease. If a person with MS does have a sibling or a child that they've shared their illness with before, it is acceptable for them to tell them that they are in the process of sharing their condition with another person. Your relationship should be one-on-one and as close as possible. There will always be times when you need to discuss an issue between friends or family. When this occurs, please do not hesitate to call the helpline if needed.

Are there any services available for people living with MS who want to keep their disability private?


Yes, many organizations and support groups exist specifically designed to help those living with MS continue to live independent lives despite the challenges that come with life with MS. The American Academy of Neurology (AAAA) has launched a website dedicated to providing information and resources to those living with MS who wish to remain anonymous, including information on treatment options and how to connect with care providers. They also provide lists of local social clubs, medical professionals willing to meet at the office or at home, and programs in communities across the U.S. For more information on these and other support organizations, visit www.answerswithMS.org/support/. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society has created the Online Support Group to allow individuals with MS to communicate privately with other people who are experiencing the same struggles they are. The group is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.


What is the most important thing to know about getting diagnosed with MS?


If you think you may have MS, take time to ask yourself whether the information provided by your doctor is accurate. This question can help determine if a diagnosis of MS makes sense. It can also serve to identify if your physician has been appropriately trained to recognize the symptoms of MS, which could potentially prevent unnecessary testing or medications. In addition, having enough healthy foods to maintain your weight may help reduce the risk of developing diabetes, heart disease, osteoporosis, or certain types of cancer. Learn more about how diabetes affects people living with MS here and learn how the body responds to insulin here.

How would you describe the quality of life for people living with MS?

The quality of life varies greatly depending upon where you reside, but it can range from mild, manageable fatigue to debilitating","No. You can't take a child with MS and pass it on to another person, as there are risks involved in that scenario.\nB The only way you can do this is through blood transfusions or organ transplants. If you want to take an extended period of time off without any physical impairment (ie: getting rid of the physical symptoms), you have to be on insulin. As such, it would be best to avoid taking long periods of time off altogether. \r

Here, a man and woman share their pain medication during a doctor visit in San Diego. When patients are married, couples often try to avoid having sex because of the risk of passing a sexually transmitted disease. Because many women experience nausea as well as other symptoms, there may also be some fear of contracting HIV from sexual contact. In addition, women often become ill after childbirth, so they may not want to continue seeing the doctor even though they know they should. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (Photo: Gerald Herbert, AP)

You can transfer it to a grandparent, brother or sister. The patient must be 18 years of age and have been diagnosed with MS by their physician or the VA, or have a parent who has had this diagnosis. But you cannot send it back home until after the patient's condition improves substantially and no longer requires hospitalization.\1\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ This is true even if the patient does not receive treatment from an institution. See, e.g., P. Lafferty et al., supra note 1, at 3-4 (explaining that if one spouse receives care from an institution, but the other spouse is treated by the same facility for similar reasons, both spouses may be eligible to receive medical care). A child cannot inherit from a sibling unless there are three or more siblings living in the household. See also E. Rabinowitz & S. Jaffe, The Importance Of Grandparents For Patients With Multiple Sclerosis: Evidence From Two U.S. Studies (1999) (noting that ""a minor niece has never contributed more than two percent of her own annual income"").

If a person dies without receiving an annuity payment, then the remaining amount--after interest and other expenses--will go into the trust fund used to pay the estate taxes on the deceased's assets.

81,Q: Can I work and study full-time with multiple sclerosis?\nA:,"No. Your employer may require you to work part time or temporarily on a flexible schedule, but your doctor must approve the change. \N\A: Are there any additional costs to be considered when determining which part of MS can be treated through MS Therapy?\nA: Yes. The most common expenses include: \1\ Cost for the first year of therapy; \2\ Treatment cost per month; \3\ Drug co-pays that are charged by insurance companies; \4\ Prescription co-pays, including medications prescribed in a hospital emergency room; \5\ Specialized equipment like MRI machines and EEGs; \6\ Physician visits at specialized facilities for testing drugs and treatments; and \7\ Other special fees paid to physicians (e.g., physical therapists) and/or labs.\nA: Do I have to pay my monthly premium?\nA: Not necessarily! If you meet all other eligibility requirements for disability benefits under state law, you won't need to pay anything out of pocket. In fact, there is no deductible for your treatment so you don't lose your benefit if you decide to discontinue treatment due to financial hardship. You can still receive up to $2,500 per person each month until you reach your lifetime limit of $16,000. That's enough to cover everything from groceries to mortgage payments.

What should I know about the cost of Medicare Part D? What is the maximum amount I can spend per month on prescription drug coverage?","Yes. A person may take a job in an MS organization but he or she cannot have more than one degree, and must complete at least two years of college before taking another degree.

How is MS treated for students?

To be eligible to receive medical coverage under the federal health care law, an individual must meet certain eligibility requirements as determined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and state insurance departments. For additional information about eligibility, see The Student Assistance Program at www.healthcare.gov/studentassistance. More information can also be found on the HHS website at http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/. Individuals who are currently enrolled in school programs that participate in a student assistance program are not eligible for the HSA (see above). If you do not want to apply for the HSA, contact your local student financial aid office or contact your educational institution's financial aid staff or administrator to discuss how to avoid paying taxes on a significant portion of your income when you get married. Many colleges offer special financial aid packages for spouses of people with MS. However, these packages often include only a small amount of money that you will need over the course of your lifetime if you choose to live with MS. Your health plan should provide you with information regarding whether it offers any type of special health savings account or health care cost sharing. Some universities allow children of active-duty service members and veterans to use their GI Bill benefits after they graduate from high school, and some schools are beginning to offer this benefit through financial aid programs.

What happens to the student loans in my name? \nA: Your loans are held by the SBA. These loans repay interest only; not principal. Loans made to you while you were actively participating in a government sponsored program that reimburses individuals for lost wages may be paid back. Loan payments that are not used for qualified expenses cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. To learn more about your loan status, visit your lender's web site. If you lose your job, you are responsible for all your remaining student loans. You will have to continue making payments until you get employment again, unless your employer provides a hardship repayment arrangement.

Why does the government require me to pay taxes on some of my earnings even though I am working while receiving disability?

Congress enacted the earned income tax credit in 1997. Under the CTC, an employee has to report his or her taxable income to Social Security on Form W-","Yes, the law allows individuals to be employed in a job that is not covered by MS. If you are interested in applying for disability benefits on the same day you apply to obtain a license to practice medicine, your application must meet all of the following criteria: You may use the skills or abilities you acquired while holding an MS license (e.g., using special equipment) as part of your occupation or activity;

You can provide sufficient evidence to show that your ability to perform your occupational duties will increase under the new law (i.e., that it would have been impossible without the MS license); and,

Your ability to do so does not exceed 80 percent of normal levels of functioning (see ""Special Considerations""). However, if you were granted an adjustment pursuant to section 712(c), you are eligible for this benefit only while you hold an MS license.

If you wish to become licensed to practice medicine without an MS license, you must submit an affidavit from a physician who is qualified to certify the medical condition that prevents him/her from practicing. This physician should also attest that his/her certification was obtained prior to August 1, 1997. The physician's affidavit must include the names of the physicians (including their full title, date of birth, address, telephone number, etc.) in which he/she received the initial letter of intent to serve as a certified practitioner. It also must contain the name and physical description of each individual who served as a certified practitioner during the preceding 12 months. In addition, the affidavit must contain the following information: Name of the person signing the affidavit

Date and location where the individual signed the affidavit

Name and address of the applicant

The number and expiration date of the MS license issued to the applicant

For more information about the MS license requirement, please refer to the MS license regulations located in the Administrative Code.","Yes, but you will need to be at the University of Alberta for three years. You do not have to take a course or get an education certificate to do this. But there are restrictions on how much time you can spend here. For example, if you're working in Edmonton, it's considered ""work-based"" and not part of your degree program. If you want to stay here for longer than three years (you'll need to apply for a permanent resident visa), you will need to meet additional requirements. The university does offer some flexible options. We cannot say that you must complete all the courses as a student. So you may find something to enjoy while studying here. The first year is quite easy, with an emphasis on business administration and research. As students progress through the academic year, they will earn credits toward their degrees. There are also summer school programs available. It would be wise to plan ahead for these opportunities so you don't miss out. Q: What kind of job opportunities do we have in MS? A: Most jobs involve a combination of manual labor and intellectual labour. This includes construction, maintenance, clerical, security and other positions where you work directly with patients. Our staff has worked on numerous medical projects over the past four decades and many have been very successful. Many of our nurses were among the best at what they did, and have continued to teach in the medical schools for which they received their degrees. More recently, many of our doctors have become highly sought after internationally, both because of their expertise and the quality of their services. And many of our physicians are now getting more education outside of their own disciplines. There are thousands of people who want to make the transition from being an independent contractor into employment with MS. Unfortunately, there isn't much help around. Some employers have asked us to do things ourselves, though most require a lot of paperwork. In addition, the training is often short and intense, with limited information about patient care and the nature of MS itself. People still need help finding a good job and getting started when they're starting out. We encourage anyone interested in MS to contact us to see whether any jobs are available in Canada. Or call 604-723-8870. Q: Is there anything I should know before applying? A: First, you are encouraged to read the guidelines and FAQs included in our website. Then visit www.dentistryandmedicine.ca/en_CA/for-students to check for updates, to review eligibility requirements","Yes. However, you must be able to do so without any restrictions on your ability to earn income and pay for living expenses. You may also want to consider a part-time or limited time work opportunity. If you have MS, you should talk to an employer about the possible benefits of a job that requires working from home while you are still able to perform normal duties in the workplace. For more information, see our Work With Multiple Sclerosis page.

Q: What other resources can I find for MS?\nA: There is lots of information available online on MS. A good starting point is this list from HealthCareForAll.org (a national organization helping people living with MS): http://www.healthcareforall.org/MS_resources/

Q: What are some things I should know before getting help with my medical bills? A: Before contacting us with questions about your medical bills, it's important to understand what we can assist with. First, if you suspect you might be unable to pay your bills because of your diagnosis, we strongly suggest you contact your local chapter of the American Medical Association. Your doctor will explain why his or her treatment options are no longer covered by health insurance, and how you can get them.

You may also wish to discuss payment plans with your insurer or pharmacy. Be sure to inquire about whether you'll need regular follow up visits or treatments to make sure they're being done effectively.

Next, read through our MS Care Guide. This comprehensive document provides everything you need to know when you have MS and its associated symptoms such as headaches, vision loss, fatigue, joint pain, weakness, numbness, tingling, numbness, hearing loss, cognitive problems, depression, memory loss and even dementia. It goes into great detail about diagnosing and treating MS. And, remember, this guide applies only to those who have received medical care since becoming symptomatic or at least had access to it.

Finally, there are several ways to secure assistance and support during the first few months after onset. Our Services Directory lists additional programs, services and groups","You will have to take a few years off before you can start working. If you want to start work at age 50, that's fine, but it won't be enough time for you to fully recover from your disability or until you are healthy again. There is no guarantee that you will return to the job market as normal in your 50s or 60s. Some people have returned to their old jobs after suffering severe MS; others have not. The first step is finding out which of these scenarios applies to you. Once you know what your options are, you should contact a lawyer who specializes in employment law to discuss the possibilities. In some cases, you may not even need an attorney. Read more about MS Workplace Disability Laws

What if I'm disabled under other federal or state laws? What about my spouse? How do I apply?\nA: Your application must comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws regarding disability. For example, you cannot have been denied a job because of your condition. Your application also must include information on any disability benefits you have received and the reason(s) why you were unable to perform the essential functions of your job, including any medical conditions or injuries you may have experienced. Any assistance provided by the Department of Labor, Social Security Administration (SSA), or Veteran's Affairs (VA) program to assist you in obtaining or maintaining employment does not constitute a violation of Federal, State, or Local Law. It may therefore be possible to obtain unemployment compensation through one of those programs without having to prove that you were actually disqualified for employment. Read more about Employment Rights Under Other Federal and State Laws

Can my child become dependent upon me if I am disabled? Can my wife get a job if she has MS?\nA: Yes, as long as you qualify. A family member could be considered dependent on another family member for purposes of FMLA and/or SSI based on the rules of both. However, there are limitations. First, any nonparentally appointed person, such as a parent, sibling, grandchild, grandchild's spouse, or domestic partner, can make decisions concerning your health care, food, housing, transportation, school, activities, etc., and they can set up your insurance or Medicaid plan. Second, while the rules of both federal and state government are similar, they differ slightly in how much weight to give each individual agency's interpretation of the facts. Read more about Dependent Children

Do I have rights when I tell employers that","Yes. You must be able to provide support for a family member in the home with MS, either by volunteering or taking time off to do so. You can work more than one job, but you will not be eligible to take time from your studies if you are working for another employer as part of that same arrangement. \qquad * * *\r

Back To Top","Yes. (Note: You are allowed to do so, but you must be sure that this does not interfere with your employment or academic activities.) You may also continue to carry out other medical, mental health, or spiritual needs without restriction. However, if you find it necessary to limit your participation in some aspect of your life because of MS, you will need to submit an application to the Rehabilitation Commission, or, if you have already been accepted for such a commission, to the Rehabilitation Board within 45 days after your appointment as Director. Q: What kind of benefits can I receive from having my disability status removed?\nA: The Disability Benefits Administration (DBA) offers several options for people who want to apply for benefits under the Rehabilitation Act: (1) through the ""Directive to Provide Assistance to Persons With Disabilities,"" approved June 14, 1980, and dated October 7, 1984;

(2) through the Reasonable Accommodation Act, which applies only if a person has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; or

(3) through the Directives for Employment of Disabled People, issued on March 16, 1987 and August 1, 1990. Each type of assistance is described below. (NOTE: A direct payment may be made by check only at the Federal Treasury Offices in New York City and Washington, D.C., and mailed to the address listed below. For information about mailings and forms, call 202/452-4500 or write to Office of Social Security Programs, PO Box 1279, Baltimore, MD 21202.) In addition to these options, there are numerous programs funded solely by private donations, including National Institutes of Health grants, federal research grants, and charitable gifts. To learn more about voluntary donation, read IRS Publication 1571 - Filing Forms with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Q: Where can I get help with filing taxes and making claims for benefits under the Reasonable Accommodations Act?\nA: Contact the IRS at 800/934-1252 or visit www.irs.gov. Q: Is it true that someone can't legally file income tax returns because they are disabled? How can I know whether or not my disability is considered to be substantial enough to qualify me for an exemption?\nA: No. Income tax returns are filed even when a taxpayer is incapable of performing certain essential functions of the job, such as paying sales tax. See Pub. 514. This","Yes. You must first be cleared by your health care professional to do so; then you can apply for a disability allowance from the Social Security Administration (SSA) based on both your medical condition and your income, as well as the fact that you have worked at least 20 hours per week in each of the last two years.\n\nIf you are diagnosed with MS, you cannot work or attend school full-time until you receive your SSA disability award.\n\nThe maximum amount you can earn before you lose benefits is $6,000 per year -- about $9,000 per year if you earn more than $50,000 a year. If you need more money, you can ask for a hardship exemption. In addition, you may qualify for federal income tax credits, which will allow you to get up to 30% of your adjusted gross income. See Federal Income Tax Credits for additional information.


How does my state determine how much I should receive? The SSA determines what portion of your benefit is paid to you under the SSDI program. Your State Department of Social Services (DSSS) sets an eligibility ceiling, which is generally higher than the maximum earnings you can earn. For example, if you earned $60,000 as an artist and had been working full time for one year, but only got $28,000 in SSA pay, your eligibility would be reduced to $48,000 because you would not meet the SSA ceiling. For more details, see What Is My State's Eligibility Limit?. This means that even though you may have earned enough to make it through the entire year without having to work, you might still have to take some pay cuts. As long as you show proof of employment, you could eventually get back all the money you lost. For help determining whether your income is sufficient to meet your federal benefit limits, please contact your State Department of Social Services.


What if I already receive disability benefits? How do I receive them again? Once you've received monthly payments, there is no limit to how many times you can receive benefits. However, if you have previously used a state program, such as Medicare or Medicaid, to help defray expenses related to your disability, you won't be able to use these programs again after receiving your SSDI or SSI benefit. If you use another public assistance program, such as SNAP (formerly known as Food Stamps), SNAP may not cover expenses related to your disability. For more information, see Your","Yes, you may. However, to be able to continue your studies on a part time basis, it will be necessary for you to complete an additional course of treatment with a physician at your local MS center. If the doctor believes that you will have difficulty completing this second course (MSC2), then you will not be allowed to attend class or take any other classes during the semester. You should contact your department head/professor for further information regarding this requirement. \r

\r

NOTE: The number of courses required is reduced from 6 to 5 in order to balance out the number of students who are permitted to take an alternate schedule. Therefore, students without prior college credit, those studying abroad for more than 2 semesters, and those enrolled in a language program that has been approved by the instructor as equivalent to English may not take the MSC2.\r


Q: What if my MSU disability insurance does not pay me my tuition, fees, room, board, or books?\nA: We strongly recommend that you check with your insurance company to verify your eligibility before enrolling. Also, please note that your health care provider could make a determination about whether or not you can pay for your education if they suspect that you have MS. If you believe you do not qualify for financial aid, we encourage you to visit our Financial Aid page for assistance.\r


Q: When am I eligible to transfer to another school, and how much should I expect to pay?\nA: If you attended a MSU campus before January 1, 2005, then you are considered a new student. Your enrollment status changes to ""inactive"" once you've lived at a MSU campus for 3 months or longer. For more information, see our Financial Aid section.


Q: What about my parent(s)? How do I keep them informed while I'm attending MSU? A: While attending MSU, you must notify your parents about all medical conditions that require hospitalization, prescription medication, or surgery. This includes but is not limited to high blood pressure, diabetes, HIV, cancer treatments, osteoarthritis, epilepsy, migraines, depression, chronic pain, sleep apnea, asthma, thyroid problems, high cholesterol, obesity, heart disease, stroke, glaucoma, AIDS, hepatitis B, or diabetes. Please remember that you'll need proof of insurance coverage when you enroll in classes at MSU. In addition, we encourage you to report any health"
83,Q: Why get episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis?\nA:,"There is no cure for MS, and there is some evidence that it may be possible to treat the disease without having to use drugs. However, if someone has been taking medications like those used in our program, we will check with them every 6 months (or more often if they are getting worse) to see if their symptoms have resolved or worsened. It's important to remember that treatment does not mean remission from MS symptoms, but rather helps people stay healthy while they recover and regain function. If you continue taking your medication regularly, you can expect to experience long-term side effects such as mood changes, blurred vision, memory loss, joint pain, dizziness, increased sensitivity to light, fatigue, irritability and depression. When you stop taking your medicines, these side effects might disappear but you will remain at risk for relapses.\nSee FAQs about treatment for multiple sclerosis at http://www.multiplemercurycenter.org/about_ms.html --------------------------------------------------------------------------\2|Back To Top | \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|About Us|\nThe Multiple Mercury Center provides a high quality health care product line that addresses an array of medical conditions including chronic pain management, weight control, bone growth, sexual dysfunction, mental disorders, heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes and autoimmune diseases.

We also have a drug called rapamycin that acts on the body's immune system to remove the proteins from the plaque and cause the inflammation to subside, leaving behind a clear white matter behind the damaged area, which is thought to be important for healing myelin.

[on The Wolverine (2013)] It's a great movie about superhumans, but it's not a particularly interesting story. What I like about it is how Logan manages to come back to life in just a few short months. He does so with superhuman strength and speed, as well as his amazing healing ability -- he comes back stronger than ever before! Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy this film as much as I did the first one because of the way some of the characters were written and acted.

I never wanted to play Wolverine again. But because of the publicity surrounding the character, people asked me if they could see him, and I finally agreed to the audition for X2. I didn't understand what I'd done wrong. But then I had another run at playing Wolverine for Marvel Studios, where they gave me a second chance - and I made them pay for all my lost money. That was such a blessing, I couldn't ask for more.


There are other ways you can make money - be successful on stage, become famous - but none of these options are available for me.


If someone tells me they love me, I'll try to give them a kiss; if they hate me, I'll scream for three days.


Salary (3)","I had been trying to stay off MS for some time. It was very difficult and embarrassing, even at my age; I really wanted to be cured. My symptoms were increasing, but because of what I ate (lots of protein), I thought they would subside. Eventually, the disease got out of control, which is why I stopped eating meat.\r

\r

That was until 2011 when I started noticing that my MS was getting worse. There wasn't any treatment in place then, so I went for an MRI scan. Afterward, I learned that there might not have been any MS activity in my brain. The next day I received an email from the neurologist who did my MRI saying, ""This looks like cancer."" So that was the start of my diagnosis with relapsing multiple sclerosis, or rMS.\r

\r

I'm on medication now, but it's hard work. When you're on it, your body has to do more than just sit around waiting for things to go away. You can only take five milligrams every two hours. Even with this, I still need to eat. As for food, I've always eaten whatever I could get my hands on; it depends on the time of day. In July I decided that since my symptoms had gotten worse, it was best to change my diet.\r

\r

What are your thoughts about people who say their brain gets better when they stop smoking?\r


\r

Well, if it happens that way, what does it mean? Smoking may help cause cognitive decline, but that doesn't necessarily mean you'll become less intelligent. What it means is that your brain takes up more space, and that's one reason why smoking may increase your risk for Alzheimer's disease and other dementia later in life.\r

\r

If it turns out that no matter how much you smoke, you don't have the same damage you once did, and your memory improves, are you OK with that?\r

\r

No. If your mind suddenly changes after years of being plagued by terrible memories, that's a sign you have a neurological disorder. That's why I keep track of my moods over the course of many months. Sometimes I feel good, sometimes I feel bad, but overall, I think the changes in my mood reflect my brain going through a bit of a transition.\r

Your body temperature can rise to 100 degrees for up to three days after you start seeing doctors. You may have difficulty speaking with your mouth open, swallowing, and walking and running. Your muscles might feel stiff and loose. Your vision becomes blurred or blurry, especially near bright lights. Your eyes begin to swell and become irritated. Your hands and feet swell. Muscle aches and pain develop around joints. People who work at elevators and escalators often report having problems breathing in their workplace. This symptom has been described by a number of different people, but many believe it comes from high blood pressure. There may also be nausea and vomiting, and frequent chest pains.\r


Other people experience fatigue, confusion, trouble focusing, memory loss, and other symptoms that seem unrelated to MS. For example, they'll see unusual changes in their handwriting or their ability to speak fluently. Some people will even have a sudden change in how they look if they don't take care of themselves. When someone does try to take care of themselves, though, MS is usually not an issue.\r


How common is it? The World Health Organization estimates there were more than 200 million cases worldwide in 2000.\r


\r

\r

What are the possible treatments?\r


There aren't any medications currently approved for MS. But there are plenty of treatment options available in case of relapse. These include drugs to reduce inflammation and promote healing; immunotherapy to help restore normal immune function; and surgery to replace damaged tissue or block abnormal nerve growths. Doctors recommend taking aspirin when you first notice new recurring symptoms, and using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and natural treatments such as massage therapy and acupuncture. A diet that promotes balanced intake of vitamin E and B vitamins also seems to be helpful for those who suffer from MS. If you're being treated for depression, talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of antidepressants.\r


Is there anything else I should know?\r


For patients trying to recover from MS, there's no single answer to this question, so we strongly encourage them to ask questions about the causes of their","It's not a disease. It has nothing to do with your brain or the muscles in your body. The ""symptoms"" are caused by inflammation in one or more parts of the nervous system that can be treated and cured (or at least greatly diminished) with an effective treatment (drug, surgery, etc.).

Solutions for MS Symptoms and Treatment

The most commonly used treatments for MS symptoms include: medication, lifestyle changes, and exercise. These remedies work well, but there is no cure for this debilitating illness. There is also no evidence-based medical solution that provides any kind of relief from MS symptoms. So what happens when you try something different?

What I like about the way you've done it is you've created a detailed plan and detailed information on how to get your life back to normal. You have explained your symptoms, your condition, and why they happen so people can see why that would make them feel better. You've put all the information together into a detailed program which includes instructions for everything you need to know to get back to normal. That makes me very confident about your ability to help others get back to their healthy lives. If you could share your program online please would you please do so? Thank you for your time!


Thank you again for taking the time out of your busy schedule to answer my questions.


I want to thank you for offering us this opportunity. Your company is wonderful and I love working with you. I appreciate every minute of every day that I'm here. You have helped me so much and I will continue to use you as a resource in the future. I look forward to meeting you soon.


Best regards,

John I'd like to ask you some specific questions regarding your treatment protocol - specifically what do we expect to achieve during the first month of your treatment? How often should you do these treatments and how long are we going to tolerate them until we are able to return to our normal lifestyles? What are the best places in our home to do our exercises/exercises? Do you offer any special services for children who are suffering from a variety of mental illnesses including MS, ADHD, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, etc.? Also, if we were doing a lot of activities like yoga, Pilates, walking, eating good food, gardening, etc., where would we start/end each session and what kinds of things should we incorporate into our routine? Are there any areas that seem particularly difficult or problematic/stressful or unpleasant?","Because the MS was not a new disease. It had been around for thousands and millions of years, but never before would it have been discovered that there were people who had it in their family history and could be cured. In fact, this is one of the few medical conditions that has existed since time immemorial where all people can be healed by the same method of treatment. It's called autoimmune-mediated therapy.\r

< Prev Next >","This is because the disease progresses from ""spontaneous"" to ""comorbid."" Spontaneous, meaning an illness that is caused by your own body and/or the environment. Comorbid, meaning you have MS (multiple sclerosis) but also other diseases or conditions like Parkinson's or heart problems, or even another medical condition like depression. Sometimes when a patient has more than one type of disease they can be confused with each other.\r

\r


MS has two stages: \r

\r

1. The first stage is referred to as acute relapses. In this stage, symptoms are mild but often long lasting (sometimes for years). These typically involve stiffness in a joint, fatigue, joint pain, headache, and dizziness. 2. After several weeks of worsening, there is usually a period where symptoms subside completely. Most patients will experience at least some relief within a few days. 3. At this point, symptoms may begin to recur, but they rarely last longer than three months. Many people who think they've had a relapse of MS never do. And many others don't ever want to go back to MS. I know it must seem overwhelming to hear that you might still be having recurring MS symptoms. But remember: It doesn't mean anything bad is happening to you!

\r


Some symptoms that occur during both the initial stage and the subsequent one include fatigue, joint pain, headaches, muscle weakness, and vision loss. A few people develop chronic fatigue syndrome and even a neurological disorder called fibromyalgia; these are all symptoms that could possibly be related to MS.\r

\r


In fact, some people report more severe symptoms that resemble symptoms of ALS. For instance, people with MS who suffer from seizures have been known to recover fully after a partial seizure.\r

\r


Many people who try to tell their friends about MS will say something along the lines of: ""It just goes away...it comes and goes."" That's not true! You're probably going to have episodes of symptoms over time. It's normal to see some improvement over time, but it's important to note that some symptoms take a while to go away entirely. If you experience any persistent or recurrent symptoms, keep them to yourself and let your doctor know what they are. She will likely ask you to stay off medications and help with diet changes. Keep it to yourself if she says you shouldn't eat dairy products. Do","MS is not the same thing. The two are distinct diseases, with different causes and treatments.\r

\r

MS affects more people in America than any other disease. It's estimated that approximately 1% of Americans have it, but many others have the symptoms but don't know they have it. In 2013 there were about 26 million adults living with this disease in the United States, but only 2.4 million had a diagnosis. Most people who have MS have an inflammatory condition called rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or ulcerative colitis (UC), which can cause debilitating pain, stiffness, joint swelling, and redness. Often these conditions are misdiagnosed as MS because the condition is similar to another disease called IBD, for autoimmune polyarteritis nodosa. As you may guess, no one has ever proved the connection between RA and MS. \r

\r

About 2-3 years ago, we began receiving a lot of questions from readers about what was going on in their body when they started experiencing symptoms like pain, stiffness, joint aches, and loss of appetite. Many were confused by our response to an article from last year that said eating disorders aren't caused by chronic stress, depression, or anxiety -- they're actually caused by an imbalance of hormones. That study showed that both stress and depression cause your body to release endorphins and dopamine, which makes us feel good and happy. But when you take all those chemicals away from the brain -- including some of the neurotransmitters that trigger feelings of well being, such as serotonin and norepinephrine -- the body goes into overdrive trying to make up for lost energy, causing a cascade of physiological changes that leads to problems like weight gain and diabetes. \r

\r

There are now a number of ways to improve your health without taking drugs. For example, there are things we do every day that help prevent illness. If you start using acupuncture, for instance, or massage, you'll find that your pain will lessen and your stress levels won't be so high. There are also herbs that work better than prescription drugs at treating chronic conditions, including herbs that are effective against osteoporosis and cancer. We've been able to reduce our blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides even while taking medication. Another way to protect yourself is to eat lots of healthy foods like fresh fruits and vegetables, organic chicken breast and turkey, fish, eggs, nuts, olive oil, dark chocolate,","This is called an exacerbation. It is the same with rheumatoid arthritis, which we all have because our immune system attacks the joints, so they start to respond and inflammation starts again.\r

[00:37:28] \r

It's also called ""mild"" or ""moderate,"" because it doesn't affect the joint.\r

[00:38:08] \r

When you do get it in your body, we call this disease relapsing MS, or RMS. For people who have had MS for years, it may be mild. When it gets into other parts of the body, that can happen too. In both cases, there are symptoms. And sometimes when a person has these early signs, it's difficult for them to know if they're going to end up having another relapse of MS. So what we try to do is find out as much as possible about how they got it, whether it was autoimmune and not autoimmune (for example). If their MS was caused by something else, then we'll try to determine what causes their symptoms first, before trying to figure out if they should get MS treatment. \r

[00:39:19] \r

We always talk about the difference between disease severity, like from low blood sugar levels, versus MS diagnosis, where you don't know that you have MS until you get an MRI or some sort of physical exam. What we've done in those two situations is to look at the brain and see what happens in the brain when someone has MS. We find that people who have MS tend to have more problems with memory loss than people without MS, and also have less ability to think clearly. They may also be able to recognize faces but not understand what people are saying.\r

[00:40:18] \r

So we want to ask people to go through a test called the Visual Analogue Scales [VAS], because it measures the speed of processing, the amount of mental processing that takes place. Sometimes people remember things better, and sometimes they don't. That helps us tell if this is a case of MS, where people have trouble with thinking skills, or they have trouble remembering things.\r

[00:41:14] \r

That way, we can make sure that we can treat it. Often, if you come down with the symptoms, there's nothing wrong physically with you. But with MS","It's called MS. Some people are able to take their MS medication for a few months, but it doesn't work very well if the disease is still there. The more you live with an illness, the more your brain gets damaged and there are more attacks that lead to disability. This means you can have many relapses or even die from the disease without ever taking medicine again. When I was in my second remission from MS and saw the symptoms get worse, I decided to go back on MS medications because the damage had gone too far. You can't just sit around and take meds all day long. If your mind is working fine, you'll stay out of trouble, but when your body starts acting weird, you need help.

PPS: What about this one guy who has a good job, his wife is doing great, he's going to be a father soon, and they're both super happy about having cancer free, healthy kids. And then one night while sleeping, he's hit with a vicious flare up of MS. He wakes up in the middle of the night and is completely paralyzed from the neck down. His doctors call him ""incomprehensible"" until he's finally able to communicate using only his eyes, his speech comes in through clenched teeth, and he talks like a lunatic. It takes weeks before we find out why the MS is so bad.

B-52,T-64 (Glioma) B-52,T-64 (Glioma), CABG (Glioblastoma multiforme) and EGFR are associated with a variety of malignancies. The prevalence rate for the three different types of gliomas is 1 in 5,000 and for all three the incidence rate is roughly one per 100 000 person years. This high incidence has led to the idea that GBM cells may be involved in the development or progression of many of these diseases. Several investigations have investigated this hypothesis. In a retrospective study of patients with a history of lymphoma who were treated with chemotherapy, a strong association was found between the presence of a T cell receptor polymorphism and increased risk of developing new relapsed/refractory tumors [27]. A few reports show an association between the genotype of CD4+ T cells and the risk of recurrent glioma or brain metastases. However, most studies reporting results from prospective clinical trials of GBM patients did not find any significant difference in survival rates after treatment. However, a recent meta-analysis by the European Association of Cancer Registries showed that patients with CD4+ T cell receptor variants had significantly decreased overall survival compared with patients without CD4+ T cell receptors at baseline [28]. Most authors suggest that T cell receptors act as antigenic targets in human immune systems, and that CD4+ T cell receptor subtypes can play a role in tumor development and progression. A further issue concerns their ability to protect against cancer. In animal models they have been shown to reduce the effect of immunotherapy by interfering with anti-tumor effects of chemotherapeutic drugs [29]. It remains unclear whether these changes in immune responses are due to compensatory mechanisms or if they represent an adaptive response against the tumour itself. For example, the CD4+ T cell receptor has been shown to increase proliferation of some human intestinal epithelial cells by regulating p53 activity and enhancing expression of key markers of tumorigenesis such as nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) and transforming growth factors β1 (TGFβ). Thus it is possible that some patients with GBM may possess an enhanced capacity for anti-cancer immunity compared with those of other ethnic groups, since CD4+ T cells may also confer protection against certain cancers [30]. Also, while there does not appear to be a clear correlation between CD4+ T cell receptor type and disease severity, a lack of correlation between","Yes.

Genetic Risk Factors associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164275.t001 All of our participants had at least one prior diagnosis of RA or RAS in either family history [27], or direct observation of an RA patient during the past year. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. A total of 45 patients underwent diagnostic imaging that included the MRI (three different MRI scan types) and EKG. Of this group, 27 were found to have an MRI-negative lesion for CSF CXCR3 (Table 2), indicating a high sensitivity to detect CSF abnormalities in rheumatic diseases. These patients were subsequently confirmed with further clinical investigation using standard diagnostic tests. In contrast, four cases of CSF CXCR3 deficiency (CTRLH4/B6 or CRHL7/N3) could be excluded from analysis as they did not have a positive MR imaging result, but showed signs of a CSF abnormality similar to those seen in patients without a detectable CXCR3. The remaining nine cases could be regarded as potential negative controls. No statistically significant associations with other CSF markers are present in the current analyses [17]. It is important to note here that three patients (all from the same family) who underwent both radiologic and MR diagnostic studies were diagnosed with RAS only after having undergone clinical examination and clinical investigations. Therefore, in this case-control design, the presence of a non-invasive test may not reflect true rheumatological findings. As such, the results presented in Figure 3 indicate that CSF CXCR3 levels cannot be predicted accurately from clinical appearance alone. Furthermore, although CSF CTLA4 and CXCR2 levels could be considered predictive of RAS, the presence of CSF antibodies against these proteins has been shown not to be predictive of the onset of rheumatoid arthritis [28], which does not necessarily suggest that CSF C","What? No. I'm not going to relapse, but you know what, that doesn't mean I can't get better. It means your disease has gotten worse, and so if you have persistent symptoms, like a chronic pain, or a disability, it's probably because of something else in the system.

[PTSD]

Q: If you had to give advice to someone with MS who was currently experiencing relapses, what would you tell them?

A: You need to stay positive. Don't let the relapse happen again. But if you're really on top of things, you might just be able to see it coming. So for me, I think I've learned how to recognize when I'm feeling depressed, or anxious or sad, and when I should check out. And I still have to remind myself to go outside and do stuff—that is one thing I am doing, which helps me feel more hopeful about my future. Another thing is to make sure that you are taking care of yourself, such as eating right, exercising, sleeping well, getting enough sleep—whatever you can, as long as you take care of yourself. As far as helping others, I try to help people around me with their illness by learning about treatment and how they can improve themselves. I also try to keep an eye out for other people whose conditions seem similar to mine. They may already be living with it. Or maybe they're trying different medications, or they're using a new medication that they didn't expect to work so well. I look for these signs so that I can call out to them directly, and ask them why they're having trouble. This way, I can offer some advice, and hopefully help them find the resources to help them overcome the problems they were suffering from earlier.

Q: What are your goals? Any specific ones you want to achieve?

A: First off, I want to live longer than I did before MS. The number of years I spent in hospital stays has greatly reduced now that I've been symptom-free for five years. Also, over the past few months, I've been managing my symptoms much better. When my doctor told me I had mild MS, he said it could last 20 years, and I guess he was right! Anyway, I want to live until I turn 80. That's my goal! A lot of people say, ""Well, you must feel lucky,"" but honestly","A case report.

Relapse

When someone relapses after receiving treatment, how will it affect their health? What is the most important thing to remember when talking about relapse?

Cognitive Function and Recovery

Is there anything that might be beneficial to do in order to improve cognitive function following therapy? For instance, should I take vitamins during my therapy sessions? If so, which ones? Can vitamin supplements increase the effectiveness of CBT?

The Role of Memory

What kinds of memories can we learn from cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)? Which types of memory do you think are the most useful? How long does it take CBT therapy to strengthen our memory? Is there any research showing whether CBT improves a patient's ability to recall past events? Would it help a person forget an event as well if he/she learned it again through CBT?

Social Skills and Adjustment

How will social skills affect your ability to adapt to new environments after therapy? Should my therapist monitor these skills at all times? Could your therapist change them to ensure that they remain consistent throughout therapy? Are there ways to enhance social skills while staying within certain limits? When should we expect a change in my social life after therapy?

Mental Health Concerns

Does having difficulty functioning at work cause problems at home? Why has this happened in some cases? What role does your employer play in affecting your mental health? How often do people experience negative feelings associated with mental illness? Is CBT a reliable tool for helping people cope with such emotions? Do you agree that CBT should not be used alone to treat depression or anxiety disorders? Does CBT offer effective ways to manage severe insomnia, including medication, therapy, or both?

Medication Management

In general, how can medications impact my recovery process? Who should use CBT drugs and how often should I take them? What kind of side effects do we need to watch out for? How often should doctors prescribe medications for me? How much time should I spend taking my medications, and what should I do once I've taken them?

Possible Side Effects of Medications

The term is used to describe a recurrent, disabling syndrome that has been treated with several different medications for over 2 years \u2013 but which was unable to be adequately controlled by any one medication. It might also occur when an individual takes many pills at once. These symptoms are often associated with fatigue, dizziness, loss of memory, or difficulty concentrating. In some cases, people will experience more than 1 symptom. A person must see their doctor about this condition because these conditions can interfere with daily life in various ways.\u003cbr\u003e

It's not only considered the worst thing you can do for your health, but it can also be very dangerous to your overall well-being.

In other words, they're living much better now.","What to expect as a first step, and what you can do during treatment.

When one person experiences an episode of MS, patients typically experience some type of relapses—and this is true for both MS and other diseases such as cancer or AIDS. This means that if you are experiencing relapses, it may be prudent to see your doctor about treatment options. However, some people who experience relapse after a few months of therapy still have a significant amount of disability because they require daily activities beyond what most people with MS take care of on their own. As your disease progresses, the time frame in which you need to take medication (or avoid medication entirely) will increase. There are also certain medications which can make it difficult or impossible for someone with MS to respond fully to medications, so it's important to keep these options in mind when considering whether to continue treatment.

What treatments might work best for me?

The best way to learn how different treatments affect patients' symptoms and recovery is to talk to your doctor. Sometimes there are specific strategies which should be taken into consideration in order to find the best treatment option for each patient. You can then discuss these findings with your physician."

Anatomical Distribution

All neuropathies are distributed in the human central nervous system, and all of them may affect different parts of the brain. The distribution is also variable between individuals. In the case of primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), it is mostly restricted to certain areas of the brain. On the other hand, the prevalence of optic neuritis varies from 0% in normal controls, to 80% for patients with advanced PPS.","A disease that affects one or more of the brain's white blood cells. The condition results from an autoimmune attack against a person's own immune system. It usually begins in early childhood, and is characterized by symptoms such as fatigue, numbness and weakness and difficulty walking or speaking.

Treatment: Several medications may be used to treat progressive MS. One class of drugs called immunosuppressants (which work on the immune system) are available for patients with primary progressive MS. This type of treatment has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.


In contrast, corticosteroids, which target a patient's adrenal glands, can help suppress symptoms while improving function and helping keep the body healthy. These medications are considered the standard treatment of choice for all forms of acute inflammatory conditions. They have proven to be useful for people who have had severe infections, but also for some chronic illnesses. They must be started at a low dose (1 mg per day), which is much lower than the amount most people take in pills.

What Causes Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis?

Primary progressive MS causes the death of nerve fibers that supply muscles. The loss of these fibers occurs gradually over months or years, leading to muscle atrophy in the affected area. People with this form of MS do not experience any symptoms that would indicate that they are dying of old age, according to the American College of Rheumatology. In fact, many cases of progressive MS are not associated with aging.

Researchers are still studying what causes this disease and how it develops. But there appear to be several major factors involved. The first is inflammation caused by infection or another immune response. Inflammation stimulates cells that produce substances that damage nerves; these substances cause lesions to develop across the brain and spinal cord. Finally, other environmental factors like stress or diet play a role.","Yes, I had one.

Q: Is there any evidence for using pemoline in the treatment of MS?


Treatment with pemoline has been shown to have beneficial effects on several symptoms and outcomes of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) or primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). In an uncontrolled trial, oral administration of pemoline (0.5 mg/kg daily, administered once daily from day 0 to week 14) was shown to be associated with significant improvement in mood, cognitive function, sleep quality, pain scores, disability and overall disease progression in patients with RRMS and PPMS. Pemoline treatment also was found to significantly improve global functional status in both groups when compared to placebo in both RRMS and PPMS. For example, in one study, pemoline therapy resulted in significantly higher levels of positive mental status than did placebo in those with RRMS; however, this benefit was only seen in those who had already begun treatment before the start of pemoline therapy. Similarly, pemoline therapy led to improved depression symptomatology in those with PPMS. These results suggest that the combination of pemoline with other anti-inflammatory therapies may result in superior improvements over standard treatments in some cases of multiple sclerosis, which are currently available. The findings of these studies should prompt further investigation into the use of pemoline as a novel therapy for MS.


There is also strong evidence that pemoline can help reduce symptoms in people with HIV/AIDS. As pemoline reduces the inflammatory response to infection, it could be considered for use in treating HIV/AIDS patients suffering from relapses after initial treatment. However, the efficacy of pemoline in preventing new infections has not yet been established in human trials.


The benefits of pemoline therapy for MS include:


• Improved cognition and memory functions. Research has shown that pemoline helps patients regain lost brain function after stroke, and pemoline may also affect the neurotransmitter system by increasing the activity of acetylcholinesterase. Acetylcholine, the main neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, plays a role in maintaining normal cognitive functioning. Although pemoline does not increase acetylcholine release, its effect on memory appears to be similar to that of drugs such as piracetam, which acts on cholinergic neurons.


• Decreased fatigue. Several studies showed that pemoline reduced fatigue within 24 hours after","A form of MS that is thought to be caused by a misfolded protein. Also called ""primary progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy"" (PPM) or ""secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.""

Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS): A type of inflammatory demyelinating disease with a similar appearance and symptoms, though this one affects the brain more than the spinal cord. It can lead to paralysis on the right side of the body and numbness in the feet and hands. SPMS may also cause hearing loss, memory problems, blurred vision, fatigue, muscle pain, headaches, joint and nerve damage, irritability, depression and other changes in mood and behavior.

SSA1: A type of autoimmune arthritis that causes inflammation in an area outside the joints, causing temporary swelling and redness. This leads to stiffness or spasms in the affected part of the body. There are three subtypes.

SSA2: SSA2 occurs when there's an abnormal pattern of new scar tissue forming inside existing blood vessels, like it happens in gangrene. SSA2 is sometimes found in people who have had strokes or traumatic injuries. SSA2 is often followed by SSA3, which isn't as severe but still affects some joints.

SPMS: The most common form of SSA2; the most common signs include numbness in the feet and legs, joint pain and swelling in the muscles, particularly the knees, hips, ankles, elbows and wrists, and a rash that can appear anywhere on the body. Sometimes SSA2 appears alone or with another type of SSA2 syndrome, such as SSA1. People with SSA2 have trouble walking, eating and sleeping, and they're at increased risk for certain types of cancer.

T-cell lymphomas (TBLS): These rare cancers occur during childhood in children who get infections from streptococcus bacteria. When adults carry these bacteria, their immune systems attack them. T-cell leukemia causes only a few cases per year in adults, but it's possible for TBLS to develop into TBLS.

In this study the most common reason given by people who developed a mental health disorder over the past 12 months was a preexisting mental illness, which is associated with about 7.5 percent of all cases of depression and 6.3 percent of those who have a lifetime diagnosis of depression. Other reasons include suicide attempts, substance abuse, relationship problems, family troubles, financial difficulties, and the death of a loved one. The most common mental illnesses affecting people with MS are anxiety, panic disorder, social phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and borderline personality disorder, which has been found to affect 8.7 percent of MS patients. Approximately 10 percent have experienced suicidal thoughts in the past 12 months. In the same time frame approximately 9 percent of people report they are having trouble sleeping. Additionally, nearly half of those with MS also struggle with other medical issues such as diabetes or hypertension, according to the study.People who develop a mental illness on top of MS have higher rates of complications from these conditions. They tend to experience more serious complications such as amputation, stroke, blindness, coma or even death if untreated. For example, around 60 percent of people with","I'm afraid not. I think it is a misdiagnosis, and the patient should be referred to an MS specialist for further assessment.

How does it work?

The drug works by blocking a protein called TDP-43 in nerve cells and affecting the flow of calcium ions through them, causing them to die off. This can cause muscle weakness, numbness and fatigue. It also causes some patients to experience headaches, anxiety and depression that persist over months or years. The disease progresses slowly - at least 10% of people with early stage MS will have symptoms but fewer than 2% of those who survive may develop relapsing forms of MS.

What's the risk?

There are no known risks from using this medicine; however you need regular check-ups because your blood levels tend to change over time and they often increase over time. If you're under 40 you should talk to your GP about taking the drug. You can read more about the safety of the drug here.

Is there any other medication for MS?

Yes, there's a new drug being developed which could potentially help treat MS - it has been tested on people whose symptoms didn't respond well to current drugs. This is called a ""chimeric antigen receptor inhibitor"".","No.

Treatment: Cytokines and immunosuppressants.


Cases of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) have been reported in the United States, although the number is considered relatively low. In some cases patients present with painless peripheral neuropathy, a progressive reduction of the sensory perception, muscle weakness, hypotension, ataxia, and visual disturbances. Some patients may also develop signs of systemic inflammation, such as rheumatic fever.


There are no vaccines or treatments for this disease. However, corticosteroids may be helpful to control the worsening symptoms over time. The use of NSAIDs, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, has been shown to reduce the progression of SPMs, but not SPMS.


The most common type of primary progressive MS is relapsing-remitting (RR), which can occur at any age. RRMS presents with symptoms that generally begin in early childhood, usually about 5 years after the first primary episode. It tends to worsen gradually until the patient's health deteriorates beyond recognition. Patients typically experience pain and fatigue as well as cognitive impairment, vision abnormalities, hearing impairments, speech difficulties, and an inability to function independently. Most people recover completely within 3 years.


Primary progressive MS is characteristically associated with several autoimmune disorders. It appears to result from chronic destruction of myelin sheaths on nerve fibers that provide information processing. These damage results in impaired axonal transport, resulting in an increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, and CRP. There is evidence that these inflammatory effects are caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the receptor for interleukin 6 (IL-6R). Thus, a person who develops a form of primary progressive MS should receive treatment with IL-6. A significant proportion of children with RRMS will eventually progress to secondary progressive MS (SPMS); however, there are very few known genetic factors influencing this development. Therefore, it is critical for individuals with primary progressive MS to have comprehensive medical screening and followup every year for 10 years, including both laboratory and clinical evaluations.","There is evidence that some patients may have a more prolonged course of MS, which increases the risk for relapses and progression. However, there are also reports in which those who experience a response to treatment (at least at first) do not achieve remission in asymptomatic individuals. Thus, it is difficult to definitively determine whether a therapeutic effect is achieved or if the disease progresses. The severity of neuropathic pain from MRI of primary progressive multiple sclerosis may reflect the degree of disability or lack thereof with respect to motor function and sensory input. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis is associated with a lower-than-average incidence of neurological deficits related to disease activity. Most studies evaluating long-term effects on cognitive function suggest significant impairment (e.g., 20%–40%), but the findings vary widely among investigators. No data are available regarding neuropsychological functioning in patients with MS. There are no data supporting the use of medication with potential deleterious effects on cognition; however, this remains an area of ongoing research. Therefore, we believe that future work should focus on determining possible benefits and risks for these agents in specific patient populations. Finally, although several different drugs target multiple sclerosis (eg, dacarbazine), their use has been hampered by drug interactions with the immune system, as well as side effects. Although many medications are effective in treating MS, there remain serious concerns about their safety and efficacy in both adults and children. Additional studies will be needed to assess this issue further.

BEDMINDS:

While MS affects every aspect of life—from physical and mental health, to cognitive, social and occupational functioning, and even daily activities such as driving—it continues to be underappreciated. This is due largely to a lack of information about what the illness entails and how it can affect your quality of life and ability to participate fully in society. In addition to the clinical trials conducted thus far, much of the current knowledge comes from two other sources. One source is published literature on MS, specifically its treatment options, outcomes, complications, and the genetic basis of MS. The second source is published literature from persons with MS, particularly anecdotal accounts of people affected by the disease. Both of these sources provide important clues about how MS impacts each individual. Understanding the breadth and depth of the information available is critical to understanding how to best manage the disease, including identifying appropriate therapies for prevention and care of the chronic symptoms.

3. In order to understand this definition, note that the word ""fear"" has two distinct meanings: 1) a sense of fear (as opposed to terror), and 2) an emotion related to danger or discomfort. The first meaning is frequently used when referring to physical fears. For example, a person may be afraid he will fall down the stairs. His fear is not due to his lack of strength but rather because he cannot reach the top. When a person is experiencing an emotional state of anxiety, such as fear of heights, we use the second meaning of the word fear. However, you can also say that someone is fearful for some other reason than their own physical strength. A person who is frightened by the prospect of flying at high speed is still afraid of falling, even if he does eventually make it to the ground. A person whose heart rate is racing to beat faster than normal after eating something spicy is still terrified by the thought of what might happen to him if he eats too much spicy food. You should know how important it is to remember which meaning of the word fear is being employed. It is important to keep in mind that there are other emotions associated with fear that do not directly relate to one's physical ability. Fear is just another kind of emotion that can have its roots in many different places within our bodies. There are several more common ones than those I mentioned above: 1. A sense of threat, danger, or annoyance. A person can become tense and uncomfortable when he feels threatened or annoyed. He often experiences tension in his chest when the subject of his concern comes up. This is called feeling a threat and may be accompanied by a trembling or shaking sensation. 2. An emotion related to apprehension (a feeling of impending doom). Often referred to as a phobia or panic disorder. A person who is prone to fear things like snakes, spiders, and fire may experience intense dread while thinking about them. 3. A feeling of insecurity or inadequacy. A person can feel insecure and inadequate as a result of physical limitations or disabilities. 4. Stress that arises out of circumstances beyond the individual's control. These include illness, financial problems, and others outside the control of the person themselves. 5. A state of panic, nervousness, and/or distress. 6. A feeling that something or someone is causing trouble. 7. A strong desire","inflammation of the lymphatic system, as due to various immune disorders or allergies; and, B: an abnormal body odor.

B: chronic inflammatory pain. A common problem of fibromyalgia patients is the inability to tolerate certain medications (e.g., opioids), so this symptom must be distinguished from other types of chronic disease. In many cases, a diagnosis of MS is made by the fact that all or part of the skin becomes red, inflamed, and taut. The patient may also feel extremely tired or have weakness, even with light activity. However, the cause of this condition remains unclear. Some believe that it results from hyper-reactivity of nerve endings throughout the body when stimulated by electrical stimulation of the skin. Other researchers suspect it could be related to the brain's own responses to stress and can result in ""migraine-like"" symptoms (see next question).

C: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (also known as acute myelogenous leukaemia) MS usually begins with a fever, headache, and joint pains (1–4). Although most people who are diagnosed will eventually improve, some remain symptomatic for years without relief or improvement. Patients begin to experience symptoms such as weakness and fatigue. Some develop ""brain fog"" after having been on an antibiotic for several days (5). Sometimes, the person feels very tired and has difficulty concentrating (6). MS affects individuals at any age, but increases in prevalence among women and older adults. People over 50 are twice as likely as young people to develop MS (7–9).

D: diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), which is a type of cancer of the optic nerves, including the retina, lens, and optic chiasm, and involves about 10% of Americans

E: endometriosis, an inflammatory disease that occurs in women only after menopause and is associated with infertility

F: fibrous sarcoma

G: kidney stones

H: herpes simplex virus infection (HSV-2) MS often develops while the individual is pregnant, giving rise to a fetus whose immune system is not fully developed, thus making its ability to protect itself against infection more limited (10–13). Therefore, if there is no effective treatment available during pregnancy, the mother's risk of developing MS increases dramatically (14). As the child grows up, MS can progress to become disabling. At least 2/3 of children born to infected mothers have an early","fibrosis, the inflammation of surrounding tissues; nystagmus (sudden eye movement); ophthalmologic disorder; paresthesias or pain with moving eyes, especially when blinking; paroxysmal ataxia; phosphenes (painful light-headedness)

Etiology

MS is a chronic inflammatory disease that is associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis and other neurologic disorders. Symptoms are often similar to those caused by other conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, there is no clear cause for this phenomenon. Most likely, it is due to several factors including changes in the way immune cells interact with the nerve tissue of the central nervous system. The most common underlying problem is a malfunctioning immune response to the body's own natural defenses against infectious agents. This may lead to autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues rather than invading foreign bodies. This can also occur following surgical procedures such as brain surgery, bone marrow transplantation or chemotherapy.

Symptoms

The symptoms of MS are varied depending on the individual. Some people experience only mild symptoms, while others might develop more severe symptoms. Typically, the first signs of MS begin shortly after age 20 years and gradually worsen over time. Typical symptoms include the above mentioned:

Daytime stiffness, muscle weakness, and fatigue

Nausea and vomiting

Sore neck and back muscles

Nightmares

Memory loss

Difficulty concentrating

Unable to move a single leg

Frequent headaches

Changes in vision

Pale skin and/or weight gain

Fatigue

Eye pain

Blurred vision

Depression

Dizziness

Weight loss

Decreased sexual ability

Low sperm count

In some cases, MS patients have been diagnosed with the same condition but without any known cause. These people usually suffer from different degrees of symptoms and/or require treatment to avoid further complications.

Causes

There is still much about the cause of MS that is unknown. A number of theories suggest that autoimmune reactions may play a role. One of these theories proposes that autoimmune responses triggered by abnormal stimulation of the innate immune system result in autoimmune disorders. Another theory suggests that damage to white blood cells caused by exposure to microbes could trigger an attack on the brain stem which results in MS. Both of these hypotheses support the idea that the","a disease that affects the central nervous system; esp : one associated with motor and sensory paralysis syn see neurosis — idemat-ic \,em-3-'tik\ adj idemat.i.cal \,em-a-'traK-s3l\ adj 1 : relating to or being fatigue 2 ; marked by loss of strength 3 : affected by, based on, or caused by fatigue — idemat>i<caMy \-se\ adv idemat'I>ness n l : lack of ability to sustain oneself 2 ; an excessive activity that produces fatigue syn see energy Idemati>al \.em-3-'tar-e\ adj [L idematus, pp. of iderere to be silent] 1 a archaic : silent b : lacking speech <~ feelings) c (1) : not uttering or speaking (2) : very faint d : extremely weak (3) : not easily aroused e : lacking the power for exertion 2 obs : unkempt, dull 3 a (1) : marked by extreme silence (2) : having no voice (3) : not vocalized 4 ; deaf, mute 5 ; having great difficulty or absence of movement 6 a : very tired b ; too weak to resist pain 7 : lacking vitality 8 : affected by or due to fatigue 9 : lacking stamina, vigor, or endurance 10 ; marked by exhaustion 11 : unable to move without assistance 12 : lacking strength of will 13 : showing signs of severe weakness 14 : unresponsive 15 : characterized by or characterized by disorientation 16 a : of or relating to the muscles of the neck or jaw b : of or relating to the muscles in the face 17 ; of or relating to the muscles of the body 18 a ; of or relating to the muscles of the body as distinguished from those involved in respiration b : consisting of the muscles of the chest or head 19 : of or relating to the upper part of the abdominal wall 20 ; of or relating to the heart 21 : expressing strong emotion 22 a : characterized by or resulting from exhaustion b : of or relating to the nerves of the brain 23 : deficient in physical strength 24 : slow in its movements 25 : marked by rapidity 26 : showing a marked tendency toward stupor 27 : exhibiting a marked decline in mental faculties 28 : not fit to perform physical labor 29 : marked by or corresponding to poor health 30 : of, relating to, or constituting the lower portion of the stomach 31 ; having","chronic fatigue syndrome\nB: a condition characterized by persistent tiredness or weakness following any kind of physical activity.

93,Q: Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?\nA:,"Yes. Studies have shown that sleep disturbances are often a problem in MS patients, and this is consistent with other studies finding sleep disruption is also linked to neurodegeneration. As well as the memory impairment which may be seen in MS patients, there could also be cognitive impairments in those who experience difficulty concentrating or recalling information. For example, patients who report having difficulties with focus might find themselves unable to concentrate in the morning due to sleep deprivation. In addition, studies have found that sleep disruptions may increase the risk of developing dementia. This is particularly true for those with Alzheimer's disease, whose sleep needs become increasingly more demanding in later life.\r

\r

Sleep disorders can also affect mood and mood-related symptoms (e.g., depression). There has been some evidence to suggest that the incidence of depression in MS patients may increase when they don't get enough sleep.\r

\r

As with any mental health condition, MS affects many different groups of people – from sufferers to their families and carers. It should always be treated by one person with MS and their family members. When seeking advice about an illness you're experiencing, it's important to remember that everyone is unique! \r

\r

MS doesn't discriminate against anyone, so please speak to someone at your local MS support group if you feel unsure about what to say to a family member. Many people suffering from MS benefit greatly from talking to others with MS, and being able to discuss issues such as treatment options and managing sleep can help reduce stress and anxiety associated with the disease. \r

If you've got any concerns about where you live, just dial 999 and press 1. You'll be asked a few simple questions","It's a very common complaint. Many of the symptoms are similar, but there is some difference with MS patients. People with MS have trouble concentrating on their tasks while asleep. They may also find that they are unable to remember things, such as where they parked, what they did for work or even who put a car seat down for them. Onset of MS is usually late adolescence or early adulthood. The disease progresses rapidly from mild attacks to more severe, relapsing-remitting disease. However, it can take up to 20 years before you are completely free of disease activity. There are several factors contributing to sleep loss; however, these include: fatigue

poor sleep hygiene - using too much hot water, smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol or taking drugs

a general lack of awareness about one's body or personal hygiene (sleep deprivation)

lack of good quality restful sleep (sleeplessness)

inability to keep the eyes open at night, which can cause visual disturbances and dizziness

excessive daytime napping (bedwetting)


If you suffer from multiple sclerosis, get help now. You could lose your memory and become depressed if left untreated. Read more about Multiple Sclerosis treatment at my website www.multipledisorders.com.au","Yes, we have seen a link between sleeping disorders and MS. I think that sleep issues are the number one reason why people with MS sleep less than other people. Some of those sleep problems may be related to MS but it is unclear whether they are actually causing MS or not, so I would say this is an important question for further research. \r

I also want to add some personal experience, because my own story has been well-documented in a series of books called ""The Sleep Revolution"" by Dr. Jules Moulton. So many different diseases can cause insomnia -- this is just one example. Many people with MS suffer from insomnia as well. The major problem is that there is no single medication for insomnia, which makes it hard to treat. Unfortunately, the only way to treat MS without drugs (or over the counter supplements) is very expensive. \r

Another important question is about what causes sleeping problems at night. Since many patients complain about sleeping problems during the day, sleep scientists have speculated that a person's overall health may play a role in sleeping problems at night. We know that depression seems to worsen sleep difficulties when it goes untreated -- the reverse seems true too. If you're depressed, you might find it more difficult to fall asleep. And if your body doesn't produce enough melatonin, then that could exacerbate your symptoms. It's probably also possible that some other illness plays a role in MS. For instance, sleep deprivation and lack of exercise can both contribute to MS symptoms.\r

So, do these sleep problems really drive MS? Or did MS make them worse? Is there any benefit to having too much sleep? These questions are quite relevant even though MS itself isn't directly linked to insomnia and sleep problems. This study shows that MS can cause insomnia while sleeping, but it does not seem to explain the restlessness and worry. In fact, most of the people who suffered from sleep disturbances during the study had no known history of MS before the study. That means that MS was likely to have affected the way people slept. But let me tell you something else that might help: In addition to the fact that people with MS tend to sleep better, they tend to have healthy lifestyles. They don't smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol excessively, or eat fried foods. They also live healthier lifestyles -- they avoid junk food and caffeine. In short, their lifestyle probably affects how they feel. So maybe it makes sense that someone with MS should get better sleep.\r


If you'd","The cause of MS is unknown. Multiple sclerosis usually begins with the onset of progressive damage in nerve cells (neuropathy), which can progress to paralysis, seizures or other disabling symptoms. In some cases, patients experience only mild symptoms; others may have a history of severe disability. At any one time there are thousands of MS sufferers worldwide who are not aware that they are at risk for developing this disease.\nOne way to predict whether someone will develop MS is by testing their blood cells. For example, if a person's blood cell count is unusually low, it indicates they might be vulnerable to MS, but it does not mean that they need to be tested for MS. It is also possible that even if their blood cell count has fallen below normal levels, the person is not infected with the virus that causes MS, so no treatment is needed. However, many individuals do suffer from memory loss when their immune systems become weakened during times of stress, such as pregnancy, childbirth, illness, injury and other major life events. If you suspect your condition could be related to the sleep disorders described above, please see our Sleep Disorders Symptoms page.

What should I know about sleep apnea? \r


Sleep apnea causes shortness of breath while breathing deeply. People with sleep apnea often complain that they feel like they are ""breathing through a straw."" Most common among women, these symptoms occur frequently in young adults, especially those between 18 and 30 years old. They sometimes result in problems in daytime functioning, including difficulty making decisions and remembering things. Some individuals find that having less sleep than usual helps them relax. Others report feeling more alert without being fatigued or fatiguing themselves during the day. Many older adults and adolescents struggle with excessive fatigue and depression and are concerned about their ability to perform at work or school, given the effects on their quality of life.

How important is sleep in managing my MS? \r


Research suggests that sleep deprivation increases the risk of relapse. And research shows that people with untreated chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) may face increased risks of all types of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. The prevalence of CFS remains high, though, and some experts think that MS is not always linked to REM sleep loss. One study found that nearly half of people with MS who had not been taking anti-inflammatory drugs for at least three months developed acute exacerbations of their illness within six weeks.

Why doesn't exercise improve my MS?","The risk of developing multiple sclerosis is increased in the elderly when they sleep less than four hours per night. Patients with multiple sclerosis who report having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep are at increased risk for memory impairment.

* * *

The most important thing I've learned from this is that patients need to take their doctor's advice about what medications to use – not me, because it's never a good idea to be too aggressive with medications!

In fact, let's talk about one medication – Doxycycline. There are many studies on this drug, but I believe my main finding was from an article published in 2004 in Neurology. In it, Dr. Richard Dement noted that ""the most common side effect [of Doxycycline] has been gastrointestinal symptoms."" It turns out that when someone takes a lot of these drugs (especially those taken at high doses) they can actually make you feel worse when your stomach is full, and that may affect your ability to eat properly later in life. This is why we want to limit the amount of drugs we take – in fact, if doctors don't know how much to prescribe, they should ask themselves whether the patient needs them, before prescribing them.

I'll end this post by saying that you should always consult with a specialist before taking any new medical treatment – especially something that could potentially impact your memory and thinking skills, like a brain tumor, a blood clot in your brain, etc. If you have questions about how a specific medication will work on your body, speak with your doctor. You probably won't learn anything by reading everything I write here…but sometimes the best medicine is learning nothing at all.","No. There is no evidence that MS is a sleep disorder. Many people believe MS is related to difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, but this has been refuted by studies showing that sleep apnea does not affect the rate of progression from active to mild disability in MS patients, and that there are numerous studies that demonstrate that MS patients with major depression have normal circadian rhythms. \r


MS patients also tend to be more irritable than non-MS patients, and may have significant difficulties with memory recall. For example, one study of 20 people with severe chronic fatigue syndrome found that those who were irritable had poorer memory performance than those who were calm.[8] Sleep disturbances can play an important role in MS. A recent meta-analysis of 25 previous studies concluded that the prevalence of poor sleep (including insomnia) was at least twice as high in MS compared to healthy controls.[9] \r


However, research suggests that if you experience any symptoms such as insomnia or daytime fatigue while taking medications for MS, it is likely because these drugs interfere with REM sleep. The best way to avoid adverse effects and improve quality of life, then, is to take them regularly throughout the day. This includes taking them on an empty stomach before bedtime or avoiding caffeine after 8pm or 9pm. These two practices should help prevent or reduce any potential side effects of prescribed medications. \r


Finally, do not feel pressured into having a regular sleeping schedule for your illness; just like everyone else, your illness will dictate what time you wake up each night. If it's 3am on Saturday, you might want to stay up until 5am. If it's Sunday morning, you might get up earlier to catch the bus home. What works for you is entirely dependent on how you're feeling at that particular point in time, so keep in mind that some things might seem better at certain times of the day. It may even benefit some people to change their routines slightly when they've already taken medication for MS to reduce side effects and ensure adequate sleep. However, in most cases this isn't necessary, and we recommend that all MS patients consider how their sleep habits work best for them. Finally, do not feel pressured into having a regular sleeping schedule for your illness; just like everyone else, your illness will dictate what time you wake up each night. If it's 3am on Saturday, you might want to stay up until 5am. If it's Sunday morning, you might get up earlier to catch the bus home. What works for you","Multiple Sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disorder that damages the brain, spinal cord, muscles and nerves. The condition affects about 1% of adults and children worldwide. People with MS may have symptoms ranging from daily headaches and muscle twitching (myalgic encephalomyelitis) to more severe disorders such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Symptoms associated with MS include fatigue, pain, blurred vision, numbness or tingling on one side of the body, inability to walk, difficulty speaking and swallowing, speech impairment, loss of coordination, joint stiffness, paralysis or weakness, mental confusion, seizures, memory disturbances and difficulties making decisions. Many people with MS also experience sleep disturbance, including trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, recurring nightmares and poor concentration. In the United States, there are 3 million people living with MS who spend at least 20 hours per week without adequate sleep.\nA: People with MS usually don't know they're having MS until it's too late. They can develop depression, chronic illness and other health issues, so early detection and treatment are key for managing these conditions. It is estimated that over 30% of people diagnosed with MS will have moderate to severe complications, but many individuals live with them into their 80s and 90s.\nA: Although no single study has been able to identify an exact cause of MS, the disease appears to be linked to abnormalities in the blood vessels of the central nervous system. It appears that changes in the way neurons communicate could play a role in MS. The immune system has some responsibility in both inflammation and disease. For example, immune cells attack the white blood cell T-cells, which help fight infection by helping to keep the cells alive. However, when the immune system attacks nerve tissue, the damaged connections between nerve cells are destroyed. This leads to the build up of plaques within the brain. This causes the person to become extremely fatigued, often leading to long periods of lack of movement. This type of damage, which results in a state of generalized weakness and even coma, is believed to be one of the primary factors underlying MS. While most people with MS survive, those with less severe forms of the disease may not.\nA: If you suspect you might be suffering from MS, it's important to visit your doctor immediately. Your first step should be a physical exam of your arms and legs. There are various tests that can detect MS. These include using a computerized tomography scan or MRI, which provides","Yes, MS is the most common cause of sleep problems. However, many other conditions can cause the same problem or are a possible side effect of another medication.

Q: I have two types of spondylolisthesis (a type of ligamentous disorder). One of my bones has been replaced by one that looks like an old-fashioned pair of trousers. My doctor says there's nothing wrong with this so why do I keep having these problems? Is it because I'm too young to remember when we used to wear them as children? What should I do?\nA: Your spondyle is made up of several pieces. It does not go through your spine; it attaches directly below where your vertebrae meet. When the spondyle goes into the spinal canal, some bone fragments will be pulled out, causing pain. If you continue to have this problem after treatment for other issues, it could lead to further complications.

Q: Who knows what's going on under your skin? Some things look strange. Why would I want to change it? How long does it take to heal from this?\nA: Many things look weird under your skin. While they may appear normal at first, your skin can become very sensitive if something isn't healthy. In fact, this is one reason that it's important to get regular medical checks every year. You'll need to discuss this with your doctor. There also aren't any products specifically designed to help restore normal skin color. All you can do is rest assured that everything will work out just fine.

Q: Why am I seeing more people with MS than ever before? And how come nobody told me about it?\nA: The numbers of people who have MS is increasing each year. However, no one knows exactly why this is happening. A recent study published in Neurology found that as the disease progresses, the number of symptoms experienced increases dramatically. These include fatigue, memory loss, vision changes, muscle weakness, confusion, numbness and tingling, pain, and numbness around certain joints, particularly those involved in the lower body. Researchers believe this increase in symptoms results from patients gradually losing connections between cells in their brain called synapses. This leads to increased susceptibility to neurological disorders.

Q: Can I get pregnant while my symptoms last? Should I talk to someone right away? Or do I wait until all the symptoms have passed?\nA: Currently, it's estimated that up to 75 percent of women","Yes, but I don't know the evidence. If you have symptoms of MS (which is more common than we thought) that include sleep disturbances or memory difficulties, and those are caused by a chemical imbalance, then I think you should see your doctor.\nB If the symptoms are due to other causes such as an autoimmune disease, it's better for you not to get involved with medications unless there are clinical signs that warrant a change in treatment. Please refer to our section on MS Treatment Options below if you're worried about taking drugs without first having a medical evaluation from your doctor.\nC: My patient had been prescribed one month of hydrocortisone and this was a very mild dose and he got better quickly. He also saw his neurologist and they did tests and said, ""You must be depressed."" But nothing else seemed to be wrong, so he continued taking the medication. The next day he went back to the neurologist and said he felt fine. So there were no side effects and he stopped taking the drug. We decided to go ahead and let him take all the medicine at once because it wasn't working well. One week later he started getting headaches again. I called my husband who works in health care policy and politics. He said I shouldn't prescribe these medications to anyone who has never done any work before and I asked what sort of proof they had to say that he could do this job. And he told me how many years ago they sent me to graduate school and how hard their curriculum was and they showed me how difficult it would be to apply for a good job here. Well, when I applied, I got into grad school only after several months of studying, including reading books and learning new things, while taking classes, which I found much easier than teaching in a classroom. The problem was that I couldn't show up on time each day and I was often late and I really didn't want to miss my classes. When I left med school, I worked two jobs and went through the motions of being a student until I finally gave in and took out loans to cover tuition. \nD: What are some of the most common misconceptions about MS treatment options? Are there any myths that doctors need to clear up for patients?\nA: There are certainly some myths around treatment and treatments for MS. But most of them aren't true! In fact, the more accurate ones are probably ""Just keep doing what you're doing!"" That's all the information we can give you.","A recent study from the National Institutes of Health found that more than 1 million Americans with MS were suffering from insomnia, or difficulties falling asleep. Sleep deprivation can lead to severe sleep disorders such as narcolepsy. However, it's not clear how much sleep is needed for a person to function normally, so this isn't necessarily a bad thing. The reason we don't know is because most studies have been done on people who have moderate-to-severe symptoms, like chronic fatigue, headaches, high blood pressure and sleep apnea. \r


The NIH report says that people with MS who suffer from these sleep problems also are more likely to be overweight, to smoke heavily (which often leads to cardiovascular problems), to take medications for depression and anxiety, and to develop diabetes. So, while you may think you're getting enough rest -- or at least being fairly well rested during your day -- you might be missing out on some very important benefits by neglecting bedtime. \r

Sleeping is an essential part of healthy living, but it has its limits. As always, make sure you check with your doctor before making any changes to your lifestyle.\r

94,Q: When will I start to feel better with multiple sclerosis?\nA:,"You should definitely start taking the medicine you're on. It might take some time, but you should eventually feel more comfortable and be able to function. Your symptoms should gradually improve within a few months of beginning therapy, although it can take longer for some patients because they have to stay on medication.

How often do I need to take MS medications?

MS medicines should never be taken at any time without consulting your healthcare provider (an MS specialist). Most people who are prescribed these medicines understand how to use them correctly and follow all directions. For example, a person with multiple sclerosis who takes a pill every day may not experience side effects, such as dizziness or low blood pressure, that are common in the same situation if she took an oral drug called Prozac instead. There is no evidence to suggest that taking two or three different MS drugs at once decreases the effectiveness of the other medicines. If you're taking two or three pills each day, talk to your doctor about whether you should continue to take one or both at regular intervals over several weeks. Talk with your doctor before starting treatment for people who have had previous episodes of MS. Even though the disease has progressed, there's still risk associated with treatment, including developing new infections, which could spread to other parts of the body. People with multiple sclerosis should also consider making sure their health care team is familiar with the treatment options available. If a patient does not want to wait until the disease is well-controlled, the most effective treatment option may involve a combination of drugs used together. For people with MS, this means combining a specific type of drug with another medicine. This is typically when someone takes an FDA-approved medicine together with another drug – either a medication or an antibiotic – which is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and manufactured under the brand name ""titrazole."" See How Multiple Sclerosis Treatments Work and Ask Your Doctor for More Information. What is the difference between a drug and antibiotic? A drug is an active substance that changes the way your body works. Antibiotics are antibiotics that change bacteria in the body so they don't reproduce themselves. These drugs are sometimes given separately and sometimes combined. Sometimes it doesn't matter what combination of drugs are being used; however, there is no indication for using the same combination twice. Examples of different types of drug include: antihistamines — such as Benadryl and Aleve

[Image Source]","You are not likely to become very well until your disease is in remission. Your symptoms may improve gradually over time, especially if you take the right medications and keep a regular physical therapy routine. Your symptoms may also worsen over time as your immune system becomes more sensitive to disease-causing substances and cells, causing new infections or other problems. The most common side effects of MS drugs include headache, dizziness, fatigue, weakness and trouble sleeping (insomnia). You should avoid taking certain medicines that could make your condition worse for several weeks, such as those used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure and diabetes. Also, do not mix different types of medicine; instead try one type at a time. After several months of treatment, it's possible that your symptoms will have returned. In this case, continue to take your medication as prescribed. If you experience any side effect, stop taking the medicine immediately and talk to your doctor about how to best manage them.

Q: How will my MS treatments change once I'm no longer taking my pills?

A: Once you've stopped using your MS drug regimen, you won't need to follow up on your current regimen anymore. Over time, your body will naturally adjust to all the changes. As long as you remain physically active, you'll still get benefits from your treatment regimen. For example, many patients who started off on an annual course of steroids find their bodies now need fewer injections. Some patients find that they're already feeling less tired. Many people report increased energy levels, increased strength, improved moods, sleep quality and pain relief. For patients who were previously taking high doses of MS medications, these improvements usually last for two years, so even if you don't see the same results, you're still getting the benefit from the therapy.","You'll get the hang of it. It's a gradual process, and you won't feel like you're in constant pain any more than if you'd had no MS at all. But you may experience some milder symptoms, such as fatigue or blurred vision; these are very common side effects from getting good treatment for your MS. \end{document}

How does Multiple Sclerosis affect my other health conditions, such as allergies?

Multiple sclerosis affects almost every organ system in your body. Your immune system can be compromised due to it, so you should take care of yourself by keeping your blood pressure low and eating healthy foods. If you have allergies, you could develop an allergy-like reaction to certain foods, so eat only as much of those foods as necessary to prevent food allergies.","Within a few weeks, maybe sooner. You can't control your immune system like you could in the past or even today. But the symptoms can be managed, and treatment is available. In addition, medication for the disease is on the way that should improve things dramatically.

FMS-A

Question: What is FMS-A?\nA: The condition is inflammation of the small intestine caused by infection with bacteria such as Escherichia coli, E. Coli or Salmonella. It has no known cause but there have been several theories put forth. Many people believe it's linked to food poisoning because the gut becomes inflamed from eating raw eggs, oysters or other foods which contain the bacterium. Others say it is caused by certain medications taken by an infected person. Others say this type of intestinal illness may be related to obesity or diabetes. Regardless, many doctors don't think this form of gastrointestinal illness exists.

FMS-B

Question: How long does it take for MS-A to progress into fibromyalgia and how do they differ?\nA: MS-A has a very short duration (two to four years). Once it starts progressing, MS-A is extremely painful. It usually causes extreme fatigue and a feeling of emptiness. It can also make it difficult to concentrate. People who are having MS-A often describe it as being like having a ""pins and needles"" sensation, where their body feels like it's trying to escape itself. MS-B is more insidious and progresses quickly. There are many different types of FMS-B. They all seem to affect similar people and symptoms. Some patients report they experience severe pain during periods of the day when they're not engaged in activities, while others feel numbness in their limbs at night. For most people, they only develop these effects after many months. Other factors associated with FMS-B include chronic stress, low blood sugar levels and excessive exercise. Doctors generally recommend taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to help reduce inflammation, if possible.

DHEA replacement therapy

(Note: This section was added in April 2013.)

The DHEAS hormone plays a role in energy production, muscle strength and weight loss. One study found that those with higher levels of the steroid-like hormone were less likely to gain weight than the rest of the population. A recent review suggested that supplements containing DHEAS could offer health benefits, including reduced risk of developing","This is a difficult question, because we don't have data on how long you'll be able to walk. We know that the disease progresses, but we just don't know if there's going to be any improvement after 3 or 4 years. \u2014 You're trying to do something about it and so far, nothing has worked, so you're not really doing much. But in fact, the therapy is still effective, it may work for another 6-8 months, which gives us hope for more treatment later, maybe even longer. \u2014 In fact, we've seen some patients who were previously diagnosed as having MS who can now walk without problems in their joints, and we're hoping this treatment will continue working for them. So, we want to get more research done, but at this point, there isn't enough information to determine whether or not there are benefits. Our next step would be to try out treatments like these.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e

It is not as simple as just seeing the symptoms of MS and then going to sleep for four months, when you are sure you have it. There's more to the story in terms of what causes MS than just being sick every day. The first step towards getting well is treating all your underlying health problems (such as high blood pressure and diabetes). A few years ago, I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes. To make matters worse, my doctor told me that they couldn't find anything wrong with me so there was no point going to see a specialist; therefore, we had to put off taking any medication until I could control my weight and eat right, which meant that I went six weeks without exercise. This time around, instead of running or riding a bike for long periods of time, I only did them when I felt like it, such as exercising after dinner and while watching TV. Even though I had already been diagnosed with type 1 Diabetes, I wasn't quite ready for it to catch up to my lifestyle at the time. I also struggled with mental illness as a result of not having any form of support from my family and friends – hence why I decided to take advantage of the many opportunities offered by the MS Society to get myself into a rehabilitation clinic, where the doctors were willing to help out and give me some advice. Once there, I met a psychologist called Lisa who helped me learn about how to manage my moods and anxiety and how to cope with depression – things that would become big issues later on in life. In addition, she gave me loads of support – including lots of therapy and group meetings so I could understand what was happening with my health. After a number of sessions with her and a couple of tests, I was finally prescribed medication (which is often difficult to obtain for people with MS), which I took for almost two years before returning home. During those two years, I gradually became less and less ill and didn't really show signs of progress other than occasional flare-ups of MS symptoms. Then, last year, when I returned to London, I got into an accident and needed hospital treatment. Within days I started feeling terrible again and was told I had multiple sclerosis. As if that weren't enough, I found out that my partner and children had also had MS too, but that none of them had ever fully recovered. This has affected our relationship enormously, especially because I'm very close with my daughter, who was","In early stages, after 1-3 years. There is no treatment that can reverse the brain damage caused by MS; it's a chronic disease and is treated through medications. The most common side effect of these medications is weight gain but they also cause a number of other problems which include joint pain, depression and anxiety.\r

<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%""><font face=""Liberation Sans","Eventually. There are people who have had multiple sclerosis for a long time, and they're not feeling like themselves anymore at all. They're not even able to walk normally. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't be on the lookout for symptoms of MS; it's just something to keep an eye out for so you can get treatment as soon as possible.\r

Treatment for multiple sclerosis is very different from the typical treatments available for other kinds of disease. For instance, anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen or aspirin) are often prescribed for pain relief and relieving muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis. However, many patients find this ineffective because there are no effective therapies for multiple sclerosis. That's why researchers began investigating compounds that could help improve function in the brain during multiple sclerosis. In 2014, researchers reported finding that S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a compound found naturally in green tea, was able to stimulate nerve cell growth and reduce inflammation in MS patients. SAMe has also been shown to work well alongside traditional anti-inflammatories. One study suggested that SAMe may be a more effective treatment than either anti-inflammatories or physical therapy alone.\r

What happens after a patient experiences their first attack of MS? \r

After they've experienced their first attack of MS, they'll experience a gradual reduction in activity throughout the day until the symptoms diminish completely over several months to years, and then return when their symptoms begin again. If your diagnosis is severe enough, it might take up to three years for patients to come off anti-inflammatory medications, and the number of new cases of MS will continue to increase at least through 2023.\r

How do multiple sclerosis symptoms differ from those associated with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease? \r

MS symptoms vary depending upon whether the person is experiencing them at the same time. People with early onset MS tend to be very fatigued, lethargic, have increased movement problems, and experience cognitive impairment. The symptoms appear gradually; however, they progress quickly once someone becomes disabled. Other people may experience symptoms similar to those seen in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Disease. Symptoms of multiple sclerosis can include headaches, difficulty concentrating, loss of appetite, weight gain, fatigue, joint pain, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, vision changes, depression, and trouble sleeping. These symptoms typically occur about 12 weeks after an individual develops symptoms.\r

I've had this same problem with Win7/8 and Vista too (Windows 8.1). I have tried various things such as cleaning and reinstalling all the applications, trying different versions of windows, changing operating systems etc... but nothing worked. The only thing which did seemed to work was to install the latest version of Win 7 (not sure about Vista) and restarted after installing it. The next day I went back to the original error message (Windows Error 0x80071300) and read through the ""To do"" section on the Help tab again. That made sense now. I am pretty sure the message was written by someone who knew the system very well so he could guess what could cause this. So after reading through it again I decided to try one last thing and see if anything helped. This time I installed the latest version of the OS. What happened was the error message disappeared but when I rebooted it showed again (but not for 2 seconds or so). After booting again the new message shows the original error from before and then it comes back and says something like ""No such file or directory"". Then it freezes. When I look at the date, the date changed to Oct 11 2010. I've never seen this happen before. What should I do? [The problem continues...]

For the purposes of troubleshooting, it is sufficient to confirm that the problem is related to a virus. There are many viruses on the Internet and there is no way for an IT professional to determine if one or more of them has infected your computer. You can try running Windows Defender against the virus. However, sometimes you may not have time to wait for Microsoft's support team to respond to your issue; so, a simple solution such as using one of our diagnostic tools will help get you back up and running quickly. In addition to antivirus products, some other tools also offer a means of detecting malicious software. They include BitDefender Anti-Malware, which offers a scan service that provides a comprehensive list of known malware programs. You can use it with any version of Windows 7 or later.


To see if Windows Defender is installed, open Control Panel (Windows Key + X) > Programs and Features (Windows Key + R). If Windows Defender is already installed, you will be presented with the options to remove it or install a new edition. Click Remove.

If you are still unable to locate the program, or if you would like to perform a system update, follow these steps. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process. After you have completed the setup procedure, restart your computer.","C:\Windows\system32\drivers\hdd_usb.sys, 6.02.9200.16420 (English), 7/14/2014 12:38:26, 174512 bytes ----------------- DirectShow Filters: WMAudio Decoder DMO,0x00800800,1,1,WMADMOD.DLL,6.02.9200.16384 WMAPro over S/PDIF DMO,0x00600800,1,1,WMADMOD.DLL,6.02.9200.16384 WMSpeech Decoder DMO,0x00600800,1,1,WMSPDMOD.DLL,6.02.9200.16384 MP3 Decoder DMO,0x00600800,1,1,mp3dmod.dll,6.02.9200.16384 Mpeg4s Decoder DMO,0x00800001,1,1,mp4sdecd.dll,6.02.9200.16496 WMV Screen decoder DMO,0x00600800,1,1,wmvsdecd.dll,6.02.9200.16384 WMVideo Decoder DMO,0x00800001,1,1,wmvdecod.dll,6.02.9200.16604 Mpeg43 Decoder DMO,0x00800001,1,1,mp43decd.dll,6.02.9200.16384 Mpeg4 Decoder DMO,0x00800001,1,1,mpg4decd.dll,6.02.9200.16384 DV Muxer,0x00400000,0,0,qdv.dll,6.06.9200.16384 Color Space Converter,0x00400001,1,1,quartz.dll,6.06.9200.16905 WM ASF Reader,0x00400000,0,0,qasf.dll,12.00.9200.16384 AVI Splitter,0x00600000,1,1,quartz.dll,6.06.9200.16905 VGA 16 Color Ditherer,0x00400000,1,1,quartz.dll,6.06.9200.16905 SBE2MediaTypeProfile,","I am having the same problem.

96,Q: most efficient and sustainable diets\nA:,"the one that is least likely to contribute to weight gain, obesity or both.

TESTED ON FITNESS: A number of studies have assessed whether a diet that emphasizes physical activity can actually improve fitness levels in overweight individuals. However, few people with overweight are considered 'fit'. The authors found that those who were classified as'very fit' (defined by having an average BMI over 30) had higher energy expenditure than the others.

CONCLUSION: the results suggest that even if you're not fit, regular physical exercise can be beneficial for your overall health and well-being.","the optimal diet has been proposed to have a low glycemic index, moderate protein, high fiber, high omega-3, moderate salt content and low saturated fat content. In general the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) are based on the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III, or NCEP's 2010 recommendations.

The best way to follow a balanced diet is through whole foods, such as fruits and vegetables. However, avoiding processed foods that contain added sugars may help reduce blood sugar levels. For more information, see ""How Much Sugar in Your Diet?""

For additional resources about weight management, see ""Living Weight for Health.""

Q: when should I take my medication?\nA: The right time to take your medications depends on several factors. These include how much you weigh, how soon after starting your treatment plan you'll begin taking the medicine, the effectiveness of your current treatment plan and any other medical conditions you have or are experiencing, and whether you're using any other treatments. You can also find out what medications will be helpful at each visit by reading this fact sheet. If you're taking another drug, ask your doctor if it might affect your dose. See How Much Medication Do I Need?

Q: how long do I need to maintain my diet? A: People who lose too much weight tend to gain a lot of muscle mass while maintaining their weight loss. This means they must start eating again to regain their lost muscle mass. That means gradually increasing your calories until you reach your goal weight. If your weight starts to change very quickly, you may want to consider losing some pounds first before gaining them back. Also note that not all people who lose weight will keep it off. Many people gain a significant amount of excess body fat during this process, so it's important to watch yourself closely while following a healthy diet. Also, when you've started a healthful diet, you probably won't notice a difference between where you were at 5 years ago and where you are now. Q: how many times can I lose weight before becoming obese? A: The American Medical Association recommends 2.5% per year. Some experts believe 3% per month would be better than 1%. It is always preferable to try to eat less frequently but no more than every two days. Even if you lose weight, don't stop exercising! If you continue to exercise regularly even though your weight decreases, it can actually increase the likelihood of developing type II diabetes later in life.


If","a diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, low-fat dairy products.

Q: when to use the right supplement? A: all of them. Most supplements have some side effects that can make you sick or upset so it is important to know if they are safe for you. If you cannot find any health information on an ingredient label and/or a website does not provide sufficient details on how it works it is probably too expensive to buy this product and you should avoid buying it. You do want to know about all ingredients before taking it. A good rule of thumb is that there is no safe way to eat more than 15% of your daily recommended intake as long as you don't need more than 3,000mg per day and if you have serious allergies then 2,000mg is probably safe. If you feel like you may be getting ""too much"" then take it at least once every two weeks until you feel better. Don't stop taking it after a couple days if you start feeling bad - it may just mean you're becoming used to the medication and your body has adjusted. Always take a close watch over your body. It is best to check with your doctor before starting any new medication. A few people have had horrible reactions to certain medications and it can make sense to start slowly and give yourself plenty of time to adjust.

Q: do I really need these supplements? A: The answer depends on what kind of cancer you have. We recommend that you try out one of our vitamin supplements first and see which ones you feel comfortable using for each stage of your disease. There are many different kinds of cancers, but we believe that some basic vitamins can go a long way toward helping fight cancer as well. Here are a few examples of different kinds of vitamins we include: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid)

Vitamin E (tocopherol)

Minerals (iron, magnesium, phosphorus)

Copper

Vitamin B6

Folate

Calcium

Zinc.

Some other vitamins you might want to consider include: Vitamin D (cholecalciferol)

Ethanolic Acid (butyric acid)

Lutein and zeaxanthin (vitamins that help keep skin healthy)

Beta Carotene (help with vision, skin condition)

Thiamine Mononitrate (reduces inflammation)

Omega-","it depends on the diet, activity level, age and health.

Fitness

FITNESS: I think that fitness is probably the hardest thing to quantify. It's not necessarily a bad thing if you're trying to lose weight or getting in better shape, but some people just want more of an excuse to eat junk food all day long. If you're doing cardio, then the goal is mostly to get your heart rate up to somewhere around 170-180 beats per minute.

I tend to be pretty picky about what type of training I use (for example, I'm a beginner at CrossFit), so I generally don't recommend any more than 50% HIIT or 15% powerlifting work for women. I don't care if you go heavy into weightlifting like a man does, as long as you can get in the 160s when working out. Of course, you should do it right, so keep in mind that this is just my general rule.

Dietary Tips\r


- Keep your meals light and fresh with reduced amounts of fruit and sugary drinks. This will keep you feeling full longer and keep hunger at bay. - Avoid foods that are processed and packaged. These foods contain ingredients such as preservatives or artificial colors and flavors. - Choose low-fat dairy products such as yogurt, cheese, cottage cheese, and ice cream. They provide good nutrition and can help lower cholesterol levels. - Limit saturated fats like those found in vegetable oils, margarine, and meat. Saturated fats cause inflammation and contribute to heart disease. Vegetable oil has been shown to be one of the best choices for healthy cholesterol levels. - Eat a variety of different types of fruits, including blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, apple, mangoes, peaches, apricots, prunes, grapefruit, cantaloupes, and watermelon. - Reduce refined carbohydrates. Fruits and veggies are packed with fiber that keeps them from being digested by the body. It also helps reduce the need for energy. - Don't go overboard on sweets and desserts. If you do eat too much, it's best not to stop until you feel full. As long as you stay within your daily calorie needs, you won't get hungry again. - Make sure you have plenty of rest between meals. A well-rested mind increases concentration, self-esteem, and self-confidence. When you're exhausted after eating, you tend to overeat later on. Try making small, frequent meals throughout the day instead of each meal. Try to limit yourself to one main meal per day to make up for lost calories. \r

This article is aimed at helping the reader understand what constitutes a healthy diet and how one can create their own personalized plan of action.

Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by an inability to regulate blood sugar levels properly. It affects up to 30% of people who are overweight or obese.[1] The main risk factors include obesity, excess body fat, poor dietary habits, genetics, and certain medications used to treat diseases like cancer, multiple sclerosis, and high cholesterol.[2][3][4][5][6] Many people with Type 1 Diabetes require insulin injections to manage blood glucose levels and are unable to control it on their own without medication. If the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, then blood sugar spikes occur which leads to severe hypoglycemia and even death.[7] Individuals with type 2 diabetes have more frequent episodes of low blood sugar, as well as having a higher chance of experiencing adverse health outcomes such as stroke and heart attack. People diagnosed with pre-diabetes (type 2) have less serious issues in managing their blood sugars because they generally do better in controlling them on their own than those suffering from Type 1, though they still have to take insulin injections as needed to ensure optimal hormone production and maintenance. It is thought that when you are diagnosed with a disease affecting your organs, it takes longer for the symptoms to emerge. That means that when someone is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, he/she usually feels sick during the first year after diagnosis, sometimes causing stress and depression. However, once this happens, many individuals feel so much healthier and have fewer long term negative health effects than those with other types of diabetes.[8][9] For the rest of this article I am focusing on a very specific scenario – a person with Type 2 diabetes who decides to lose weight by losing about 10% of his/her body weight over six months. As soon as the weight loss begins, diabetics often experience a dramatic drop in their blood sugar. After three weeks the typical blood glucose level drops below 80 mg/dL, although it can fluctuate wildly.[10] By week four, the average blood glucose level has dropped down to 70 mg/dl. Even though this is impressive, it's important to note that not everyone has the same degree of success in losing weight by reducing weight and gaining muscle mass. Some people achieve significant reductions in","The diet of a vegetarian or vegan, including raw food.

The term ""vegan"" is often used interchangeably with ""vegetarian."" It's important to note that vegans do not necessarily eat foods made from plants. Rather than eating meat, eggs, dairy, or fish, they may use other plant-based products such as soy milk, tofu, nuts, seeds, beans, rice, etc. Some people in the world are vegetarians or even carnivores. For others it's possible to be a vegetarian who eats animal products such as cheese, meats, seafood, etc., but this isn't necessary for health reasons. A good example would be someone who doesn't consume any processed meats. However, some vegans choose to avoid using certain animals' byproducts altogether, which can include dairy, egg, and shellfish products, among others.

How does eating a healthy diet compare with vegetarianism? What about veganism?

Vegetarian diets have several advantages over non-vegetarian diets. They don't have the same negative effects on human health that many non-vegetarians experience, nor do they require you to give up all of your favorite things (like, say, honey) while eating them. Eating a balanced, nutrient-dense, and well-balanced diet of vegetables, fruits, legumes (beans, peas, lentils), nuts, seeds, and whole grains (whole grain breads, pastas, quinoa, oatmeal, etc.) is much more beneficial than avoiding almost every type of animal product (meat, eggs, dairy, and/or fish). You also get far less chance of getting sick from consuming a vegetarian diet compared to the typical American diet that includes all types of animal products.

In addition to these nutritional advantages, there are health benefits as well! Vegetarians tend to have fewer chronic diseases, like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer. Many studies indicate that vegetarian diets provide better protection against cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's Disease than the normal American diet; however, many studies have also found that meat consumption, particularly red meat, increases risk for developing certain types of cancers. These findings aren't surprising because red meat is high in saturated fat and cholesterol, two ingredients associated with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases.

What are some common dietary misconceptions that vegetarians and vegans should know?

Most people assume that only meat substitutes (such as soy milk, tofu, sprouted grains, and nuts)","The nutritional composition of the diet is a factor in how well it will be absorbed. Some foods have lower energy density than others. This means that they provide less energy per unit weight, but greater total body mass. Therefore, the amount of energy you get from each food varies with the percentage of its calories that are found in the form of protein (protein-rich vegetables) or fat (low-fat dairy products). Thus, a 1% low-carbohydrate diet would contain about 3 grams of carbohydrate per pound, while a 2% low-fat diet would have you ingesting approximately 6 grams of carbohydrates per pound. For more details on nutrition, visit our Nutrition page.

Q: I've been told by some people to consume only 5% of my daily calorie intake as carbs \nA: While this may seem like a small difference when taken together, the net result is that your body can use all or much more of the carbohydrates available for fuel during exercise. The longer you do this, however, the higher your carb tolerance will become. Also note that some types of grains (especially whole wheat) do not allow for this much glucose to be utilized. That said, there is no harm in consuming these foods. If you choose to eat these foods, you should consider replacing them gradually. However, if you plan to restrict your carbs, it's best to stick to a relatively high fiber content. In addition, if you find yourself becoming ravenous at times, try limiting your consumption of refined carbohydrates, such as white breads, pastas, pasta sauces, cookies, cakes, etc., because they tend to cause insulin spikes, which has also been associated with obesity. You'll want to experiment with what works for you before making any dietary changes. Q: Most people know that carbohydrates raise blood sugar but don't realize just how important this issue is. How can you help people take control? A: It's very important to make sure you're aware of the importance of carbohydrate intake throughout the day and that you understand the role that certain foods play in helping you manage the effects of diabetes. Here are a few tips to help you keep track of your carbohydrate needs: When you begin a new meal plan or program, make sure you check out your current carbohydrate balance first. Remember, if you need additional carbs, your next meal plan must include fewer carbs.

Make a list of every item you're eating so that you can compare your menu items based upon the number of calories consumed.

Keep an eye out for","these diets will produce the best results. I want to be healthy, and therefore eat a balanced diet of good fats, protein, and carbohydrates. Q: what foods should I avoid? A: meats, eggs, dairy, red meat, poultry, oily fish and oils such as sunflower seeds and canola oil, nuts (e.g., almonds), and avocados. These foods may increase your risk for developing type 2 diabetes or heart disease, so you need to be careful about how much and when they're eaten. Q: do I really have to put together my own meals? Can I substitute one food group for another? A: no. You just need to know which ones are high in calories and nutrients and don't waste time cooking them all. Most people who follow a low-carbohydrate diet also reduce their caloric intake during the day.

Low-Carb Diets | Low Carb Diet - 5 Simple Steps By Mark Sisson - 1 minute read

How To Eat Healthy On The Low-Carb Diets!","any diet that is low in calories, high in protein, good fats and a variety of healthy foods. Q: What are some good sources of fibre? A: It's best to get your fibre from whole foods such as fruits or vegetables and beans (or meat if you're vegetarian), but even more important than the food itself is how much it contains. Fiber in whole foods like oats can be used in recipes because they have a lot of water and other nutrients; however, these whole foods contain very little fiber. For example, whole grains (gluten-free breads, crackers) have about 10% fibre, while oatmeal has only 3%. Q: I'm lactose intolerant. Is there anything I should avoid for this reason? A: Lactose intolerance may not affect everyone equally, so try to find out what makes you feel better before trying something new! Q: If I've been eating gluten free for a long time, will my symptoms return when I start reintroducing gluten? A: Yes. Your body will likely adapt faster if you eat well with regularity but it might take longer to notice its effects. You could try stopping gluten altogether (if you haven't already) after a period of no gluten consumption for at least four weeks, or just for two months. It is also possible to stop gluten completely by doing nothing on top of the current gluten diet, but you'd probably need to do the following for a minimum of six months: Reduce all processed foods to one serving per day

Take an anti-inflammatory supplement daily

Swallow at least five small handfuls of fresh fruit daily

Eat plenty of lean meats and poultry – especially chicken and turkey Q: How does a gluten free diet work and why would anyone want to change their lifestyle? A: A gluten free diet changes your gut microbiota so the bacteria you consume no longer cause inflammation. This means fewer foods containing gluten and less sensitivity to gluten. The result is a reduction in celiac disease cases, but also a decreased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, obesity and certain types of cancer. Many people who are sensitive to gluten are able to reduce or eliminate their own dietary allergens through a strict diet. Q: My friend says she's never eaten wheat again. Does gluten still exist in nature? A: The natural gluten found in plants and fungi doesn't cause problems for humans or animals, although we don't know exactly how. However, some research suggests that eating gluten could impact our immune system, making us more vulnerable to"
97,Q: benefits of physical activity\nA:,"the need for exercise or a certain amount of time in the gym. \r

This is because the brain releases chemicals to help maintain good health and protect against disease, so physical activities can provide some protection for people who are not physically active. For example, it may reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. However, there's no evidence that any specific activity will be beneficial, so you should consider whether your lifestyle changes would make a difference. A recent review found that about 50% of adults don't have enough physical activity, but others say up to 80%. There's also concern over the impact on health of sedentary behaviour and the lack of opportunity for physical activity. The government says it wants more people to get out into the community, but it doesn't think we'll see much change until 2030. So if all else fails, consider getting a job. Find out how jobs can make a big difference to our health from the Department for Work and Pensions","in the short term; \nIn addition to your health, exercise may help you feel better and reduce stress. You can also increase your chances for a successful future relationship, achieve healthier weight, lose weight easily, prevent or ease depression, and even improve the mood.

Physical Activity Tips

1) Try to get up and move around at least once per day.

2) If you cannot exercise regularly, try walking one hour every other week.

3) Take frequent walks in nature, especially when there is no work going on, and do so frequently.

4) Get into regular aerobic workouts such as swimming, running, bicycling, hiking, and yoga.

5) Find a program that fits your schedule. Start with a short time commitment and build it up over time.

6) Go to an exercise studio where they provide equipment. Check out this article about how to find a gym near you. Also, check out this site for tips on finding good fitness centers for your area.

7) If you are working outside, wear clothing that will protect against sunburn.","exercise that increases your heart rate or breathing speed. Physical activity is good for you and can improve many aspects of your health. It may also help prevent some diseases. Read more about the benefits of physical activity.

Q: How do I know if I'm physically active?

A: You should try to participate in at least 1 hour (3 times a week) of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity for women aged 65 years and over every day. For men, this will be 2 hours (1 time per week). If it's hard to remember how often you're supposed to do this type of work, try using an app like RunKeeper. And don't forget that the more you do it, the better you'll feel!

Q: What if my child isn't physically active yet?

If you have any concerns about your children being too sedentary, talk with their doctor first. Ask them what they need to do. The National Institute on Aging says that even small amounts of physical activity can promote mental and social well-being, reduce obesity rates, increase bone density, decrease blood pressure, lower risk factors for cancers, and reduce diabetes.","compared with sedentary individuals, those who are physically active have lower rates of mortality from cardiovascular disease, cancers and diabetes.

Q: what is the association between physical activity and cancer? A: The evidence suggests that physical activity reduces the risk of several types of cancer, including colorectal cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, endometrial cancer, bladder cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and melanoma. However, some studies show no significant effect on these diseases. For example, in a study published in 2006 by researchers at the University of California Los Angeles, ""people who were inactive or had never exercised had higher levels of total cholesterol than people who were active"" (1). In addition, there was also a positive correlation between high levels of physical activity and blood pressure, which may account for the reported benefits.

Q: is it true that sedentary lifestyles increase the risk of heart attacks? A: No, this is not true. There are two main reasons why this claim is false: 1) People don't work out; 2) they do exercise but their health is not improved.

Q: is there any truth to the claim that smoking increases your cancer risk? A: Smoking has been shown to raise risks of several different types of cancer, but the link between smoking and cancer appears stronger in women than men. Some research suggests that smoking increases the risk of colorectal, ovarian, liver, kidney, and respiratory cancers. Studies suggest that smokers' overall cancer risk might be reduced if they quit smoking. One recent review found ""that among adults aged 40-59 years, relative risks of coronary heart disease increased 4% for each extra pack per day of smoke exposure."" (2) Another review suggested that quitting smoking would reduce both cancer risk and death from cancer (3)

Q: are diet and lifestyle factors associated with weight loss? A: Yes, diet and lifestyle can affect weight loss, especially during weight maintenance phases. The most effective way to lose weight is through eating less food. This includes reducing portion sizes, choosing low-calorie foods, staying away from fatty foods, and limiting the amount of alcohol you consume. It's also important to limit stress and keep moving.

Q: what causes obesity? A: Obesity is caused primarily by excess body fat. But some scientists think that genes, hormones and other environmental factors could contribute as well. According to Dr. Mark Haub, co-author of the book Body and Soul:","the rate at which your body burns calories to produce energy in a workout.B: general guidelines for healthy weight lossC: what the average person should eat during a weight loss programD: how much protein and carbohydrate you should consume while losing weightE: how to use calorie counting or other techniques to track food intakeF: eating patterns that help with weight maintenanceG: what are some tips for maintaining muscle mass when dietingH: whether it's best to cut carbs from meals for maximum weight loss?I: a summary of studies related to weight loss, including a review of randomized controlled trialsK: what is the effect of exercise on fat loss and/or muscle gain?L: what type of dietary restriction can be used to promote weight loss?M: why does research show that cutting carbohydrates from a meal may not affect weight loss?N: recommendations for weight management after treatment with drugs like metforminO: What is the relationship between a high-protein diet and weight loss?P: how many servings of fruit and vegetables do people need per day?Q: a comparison of low-carbohydrate diets (low-fat, ketogenic) versus low-glycemic index diets (high glycemic load foods)R: what is the role of exercise in weight loss and health?S: an overview of strategies for weight management and health outcomes and interventions for individuals with diabetesT: ways to store excess body fat, such as keeping water around your waist and using the bathroom to flush it awayX: suggestions for managing blood glucose levelsY: other strategies to maintain weight if you have diabetesZ: strategies to improve blood sugar control","the general concept is that the more you move, and the longer you do it, the better your health will be. You might not know this from the fitness magazines or commercials but a variety of studies have found this to be true for most people (at least in the short term). For example, one study showed that as many as 85% of sedentary people could improve their cardiovascular disease risk factors by participating in regular exercise, even after they stopped smoking. However, there are some caveats with these types of studies (e.g., participants are generally healthy enough to participate), so it's possible that other factors also play an important role.

Q: what about all the research showing that physical activity does help prevent heart attacks and strokes? A: The evidence suggests that physical activity reduces the incidence of both cardiovascular disease and sudden death, but these effects may vary between individuals. For example, physical inactivity has been associated with increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) and stroke, but some studies suggest no association at all for mortality [13]. It seems likely that some of this effect is due to chance; but given the prevalence of obesity in America, which puts additional stress on existing arteries, the fact remains that physical inactivity is still dangerous for all people regardless of whether they're overweight or obese.

Q: I've heard that physical activity can reduce your risk of developing dementia! A: This was another common misconception about physical inactivity. In addition to helping prevent cardiovascular diseases and deaths related to them, moderate-intensity aerobic training has been shown to protect against cognitive decline in older adults [14], suggesting a potential benefit in preventing dementia among those who aren't yet old enough to develop it. If you find yourself experiencing mild to severe memory loss that hasn't improved since you started exercising regularly, seek professional advice if necessary.

Source","in some cases, no benefit; however, there are situations when it may help to reduce the risk of certain diseases and conditions. Certain health issues may occur if you do not engage in regular aerobic exercise. However, a lack of regular physical activity may not lead to health problems or other negative effects on your overall well-being as long as you continue doing activities that help maintain your body's good health. You should discuss with your doctor any questions you have about whether regular physical activity is right for you.

Q: I am overweight. Can I still get enough calories from food? A: Yes. If you weigh 150 pounds (65 kg) or more, you can consume approximately 1,200 calories per day from foods containing up to 100% whole grains and 675 calories per day from fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts. If you are underweight, you will need to consume less than 500 calories per day. The USDA recommends an individual start eating at least 2,500 calories per day but these guidelines are based on a person who weighs 130 lbs (50 kg). Therefore, anyone weighing over 150 lb (64 kg) may want to check with their physician before making weight changes.


Q: How much water do I need each day? A: Water needs vary depending on how many meals you eat, how active you are and what kinds of foods you eat. There is no way around this fact so try to make sure you drink lots of water each day and avoid sodas or sugary drinks. The following recommendations indicate the amount of daily fluid intake needed for individuals who meet recommended protein requirements: Individuals who meet protein requirements:

4,000 ml/day for men and 2,800 ml/day for women = 1 liter/day

Individuals who do not meet protein requirements:

2,500 ml/day for men and 3,100 ml/day for women = 0.6 liter/day The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends consuming between 5-7 liters (1.5-3.0 gallons) of water per day.

The American Heart Association recommends drinking about two litres (about 7 quarts) of water per day for healthy adults and children aged one to six years old. People who are diabetic or have heart disease are advised to limit themselves to one cup (240 ml) per day. Some medications also affect water consumption. These include insulin, diuretics and some antidiabetic drugs such as warfarin.


Q: What kind","a summary of the scientific evidence. (1) Physical inactivity is defined as having less than 30 minutes per day of moderate-intensity physical activity, such as brisk walking, jogging or tennis. This definition has not changed since 2001. The Department encourages adults to reduce their sedentary behavior by increasing their active activities and/or participating in some form of exercise. The National Institutes of Health strongly recommends that adults do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity every week. (2) Women are more likely to be physically inactive because they have higher body weights than men. In addition, women tend to use sedentary behaviors more frequently than men during pregnancy. Because of this difference, women may benefit from encouraging their nonmaternal caretakers to increase their active activities and participate in some type of physical activity. (3) Adults aged 65 years and older who were not already engaged in regular activity should engage in a minimum of 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity every week. If an adult does not meet this guideline, he or she can develop a fitness plan with his or her physician to achieve the goal. (4) Older adults who did not complete high school but are now enrolled in college or vocational training programs and who meet current physical activity guidelines should participate in at least 50 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity each week. For those participants age 55 and older who completed high school but are still enrolled in college or vocational training programs and meet current physical activity guidelines, they should also participate in at least 100 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity every week. (5) Among persons 65 years of age and older who currently receive Social Security disability payments for knee replacement surgery, physical activity should be assessed monthly during the first year following surgery using the modified QALYs method. (6) Adult patients receiving PACE trial treatment who continue to meet current physical activity guidelines, including both total energy expenditure and physical activity time, will receive additional physical activity support during the second year after PACE initiation. (7) Some individuals who have had knee replacements will never gain full functional independence again if they do not continue to engage in vigorous-intensity physical activity. Thus, it is important for these individuals to begin engaging in physical activity as early as possible. (8) Older people diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment should participate in vigorous-intensity physical activity (either combined with other forms of moderate-intensity physical activity) or a combination of vigorous-intensity physical activity and moderate-intensity physical activity, even though such participation could place","exercise that requires exertion, as in weight lifting or other muscle-strengthening activities; physical activity may be part of a regular schedule. However, some health professionals recommend avoiding vigorous physical activity for at least 6 to 12 months after menopause (or before age 65) because of the risk for osteoporosis and fractures. However, many women continue to engage in moderate to vigorous physical activity beyond this time point.[10]

Vitamin D is necessary for proper functioning of your immune system and bone metabolism. It also helps prevent cardiovascular disease and several types of cancer. The Centers for Disease Control recommends taking 400 IU (international units, iu) daily from birth until age 70. Vitamin D is often supplemented with calcium from fortified foods such as milk and cheese. This supplement can provide an additional 100% of the required amount.

While many people are concerned about their blood pressure, they should not avoid using blood pressure medication completely unless there is no alternative.

Low back pain generally improves with the use of acetaminophen or ibuprofen, but it is best to take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen (Aleve), aspirin, or alcohol instead. Although these medications reduce inflammation in the body, they do not fully relieve low back pain.[11][12] If you have low back pain and need additional support, see your physician for advice on which medication(s) might be right for you.","not for everyone and should be used in moderation; may increase risk of certain diseases, such as heart disease or diabetes. However, some evidence suggests that regular physical activity can improve blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health outcomes.

Q: risks of increased physical activity\nA: most evidence indicates that sedentary lifestyles lead to an excess risk of death from all causes combined but is less clear on whether sedentary behaviors are associated with higher mortality rates among the elderly. Also unclear is whether the association between sedentary behavior and reduced life expectancy extends beyond a particular population. In addition, there are limited data on the effects of moderate-intensity physical exercise on cardiovascular health. For example, it has been suggested that adults who engage in aerobic activities have lower prevalence of chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes. Therefore, information about the effectiveness of physical activity on public health is needed.

Risk factors for obesity: physical activity levels and health outcomes

As well as physical activity, the following health characteristics are also important predictors of weight gain and/or obesity:

Age (years)

Sex

Race and ethnicity

Height (inches)

Weight (pounds)

Family history of diabetes or hypertension

Physical activity level

Diet quality

Hormonal status (testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, thyroid hormone, and others)

Obesity may vary by race/ethnicity, sex, height, weight, family history of diabetes or hypertension, diet quality, and hormonal status. Studies suggest that obesity is more prevalent in women than men (1), although there is no reason why this pattern should be universal.

In general, overweight and obese individuals tend to have poorer overall health and experience greater morbidity and mortality compared with normal weight and underweight individuals. The following table summarizes findings from studies examining these variables:

Table 1. Physical Activity Levels Associated With Obesity Risk Factors

Age Sex Body mass index Height Weight Race/Ethnicity <70 years 30 15 – 26 6.3 – 9.0 70–84 years 31 18 – 27 7.6 – 10.7 ≥85 years 32 23 – 28 8.8 – 11.5 Age group <65 years 29 22 – 24 7.2 – 9.4 65–74 years 34 20 – 25 7.8 – 10.9 75–79 years 33 21 – 24 7.9 – 10.8 80+ years 35 19 – 23 7.9 – 10.9"
98,Q: most common complications in pregnancy\nA:,"most common complications are stillbirth, prematurity and infant death.

Pregnancy can be very stressful for any woman but especially so if you're a mother with disabilities or medical issues. These can result in more complex pregnancies that include labor pains, delivery complications or even death. Some of the more common problems we see include:

Pre-term labor

Premature birth (before 37 weeks)

Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)

Miscarriage

Excessive bleeding/indigestion

Irregular vaginal bleeding during pregnancy

Cerebral palsy (a condition where your brain is out of position and has trouble controlling your muscles)

Postpartum depression

Injuries to the fetus or newborn

It's important to note that many women do not have these complications, although they should always receive support from their healthcare providers. There are also other ways that a pregnant woman may experience stress as well including:

Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa

Drug use (including prescription medication and over-the-counter products like aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and others)

Sleep disturbances

Painful childbirth

Lack of sleep

Being unable to carry a child due to physical limitations

How to Avoid Pregnant Women With Medical Conditions

So how does one avoid having a baby with a medical problem? To answer this question it helps to know which medications have been shown to increase the risk of miscarriage. Here's what we've found:","Some of the following are possible symptoms.

Cerebral Palsy is a rare but serious birth defect that occurs when part or all of the brain and skull does not develop properly during pregnancy. It can lead to problems with speech, balance, vision, mental abilities, hearing and language. Symptoms include seizures, convulsions, breathing difficulties, respiratory failure, coma and death. Cerebral palsy can occur at any time during pregnancy; however, it is more likely after the first trimester. It's caused by damage to the cerebral cortex (the outer layer of the brain) and is often seen in infants who have suffered head trauma. The risk for developing cerebrospinal fluid leakage (CSF) increases as the baby grows and begins to take oxygen into the lungs. CSF leaks from the eye, ear and nose. There is no known cure.

The umbilical cord (also called the placenta) lies beneath the placenta and connects to the fetus through the mother's upper vaginal wall. Babies born without an umbilical cord are still alive outside the uterus. Umbilical cord syndrome (UCBS), also sometimes referred to as ""abnormally short"" umbilical cords, is an uncommon complication. An abnormal, thin membrane of tissue forms between the umbilicus and the placenta which blocks blood flow and prevents normal blood vessels from being formed. This condition affects around 3 percent of newborns. Once the membranes of both the umbilical cord and placenta separate and separate again, the child experiences pain and loss of movement. UCBS occurs when there is too much space between the umbilical cord and the placenta, causing the cord to stretch. If this happens within 20 minutes of birth, there may be no signs of pressure on the baby's heart. When the placenta starts to detach, the infant experiences sudden chest pains that last around 10 minutes. After a few hours the abdominal muscles relax completely, allowing the baby to breathe normally. A doctor will examine the baby and check for other health issues. Other causes of ECNS include infection, bleeding from the cervix, and infections of the uterus and ovaries.","usually ectopic pregnancy, sometimes other causes of infertility.

Q: what should I do if my baby is stillborn? \nA: you will have to get another one for $40\n","these include:

Fetal distress and pain

Lack of growth

Ectopic pregnancy

Chloasma (redness, scaling or peeling of the skin)

Proteinuria

Other possible causes include:

Preeclampsia (high blood pressure that can cause life-threatening problems such as sudden cardiac arrest)

Hypertension/hypertensive crisis (e.g., severe heart failure resulting from a medical emergency such as hemorrhage from an artery in your arm)

Tumor of any kind

Cancer

Anemia

Kidney failure (not due to kidney disease)

Diabetes mellitus

Infection (such as HIV infection)

Heart attacks

Bladder cancer

Drug overdose

Seizures

Older age

What other drugs will affect lactation?

Taking certain medications while you are pregnant may result in serious side effects. Your health care provider may be able to tell you if one or more of these medications might harm your baby:

Antibiotics (for example, penicillin and erythromycin)

Steroids

Anti-depressants

Prescription medicines used for depression, anxiety or stress

Certain antidepressants

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as those used by people taking steroids

Alcohol

Benzodiazepines (benzodiazepines, like Xanax)

How is lactation managed during pregnancy?

During pregnancy, it's important that you follow the directions on your prescription meds. If you take a drug at the same time every day, you could get dizzy. Ask your pharmacist if this affects how your medicine works during pregnancy. Some medicines can interact with each other and cause some unwanted consequences. Always check the label before starting a new medication. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about the best way to manage your diabetes and use insulin while breastfeeding.","uterine rupture, endometrial biopsy and ectopic pregnancy.

Common side effects of mifepristone include increased drowsiness, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache and/or nausea in women who are taking the drug for more than 12 weeks. Some reports have indicated that a number of patients experienced significant weight loss during pregnancy due to the increase in body temperature. Mifepristone is contraindicated for pregnant women with an underlying medical condition such as diabetes, heart disease or high blood pressure. It can cause serious or life-threatening liver damage, coma, seizures or death if administered to pregnant women with preexisting kidney failure or severe hepatitis B infection. If used during the first trimester, it may result in premature birth and low birth weight for your baby. This risk increases when your doctor prescribes mifepristone for postpartum women.","pain, bleeding and other problems.

a lower chance for successful labour

difficulty breathing or swallowing

How can I prevent my baby smoking?

Smoking during pregnancy is one of many risks pregnant women face each day. The World Health Organisation recommends that women should not smoke in the first trimester unless they plan on taking it up again throughout their lives, while still avoiding high-risk activities. This includes:

at least six hours a day

not smoking in public places, including bars and restaurants

in areas with children around you

using your phone whilst driving or otherwise being exposed to second hand smoke

smoking indoors

making and eating food containing tobacco products

eating out frequently.

To help protect yourself against secondhand smoke, use an indoor air purifier when sleeping; wear a mask if you're outside

use filters to keep cigarettes away from children, pets and neighbours. If you live in a building, make sure all windows are tightly closed. Don't let anyone else in, especially young people

keep your home clean

avoid playing loud music loudly.

If you need medical care in pregnancy, call your GP if there's any sign of illness. He or she can refer you to a maternity unit where you may be able to receive specialist advice about how best to support your baby.","postpartum hemorrhage, intra-abdominal bleeding and other problems that can cause fetal distress.

""It all came together at the right time,"" Ms McInnes added. ""And even though the baby doesn't have any family, he is a part of me.""

'We are proud of him'

Ms McInnes and Mr Hughes flew to Australia from their home in Perth, while her husband travelled back with his mother-in-law and son.

On Saturday evening, after a service at St Andrew's Anglican Church in Brisbane where the couple presented two copies of The Book of Genesis for display on the church's main altar, they were able to kiss the infant and hold hands in front of his father.

Mr Hughes then returned to Britain and Ms McInnes made arrangements to return to Perth, where her unborn child will be born into a surrogate family.

The couple described their joy as their daughter was given the name ""Sophie"".

The main risk factor is gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which can happen during pregnancy or immediately after childbirth. Some women who are at high risk for GDM may have a condition called gestational trophoblastic anaemia (GTNA). This means that their cells can't divide normally – they get clogged up with blood vessels that obstruct the normal flow of nutrients and oxygen to the baby and to the mother and her placenta. If you're pregnant with a GTMN, it could be life-threatening if you don't get treatment soon enough, so you should see your GP as soon as possible. However, even if you don't develop any symptoms from your treatment, you might still have problems when your child is born, so it's best not to wait until your second trimester to start your treatment.

What treatments work? There are some types of treatment available for GDM. These include: intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) injections;

streptokinase (statin);

preeclampsia (PND);

cytokine (TK)-induced anti-proliferative therapies such as monoclonal antibodies; and

sulfonylureas (such as amiodarone). What do I need to know before starting my treatment? It's important that you understand how GDM affects your body and whether you'll get any side effects. For example, while some people with GDM feel better after IVIG therapy, others experience severe muscle pain and loss of appetite. You shouldn't just take these side effects lightly. Your GP should explain exactly what happens with each type of medication you use. Read more about treating gdm.

Can I reduce my risk of developing gdm through exercise? Exercise has been linked with an increased chance of preventing gdm, but it isn't clear why. In our study we didn't find an association between exercise and the risk of gdm, although one previous study found an inverse relationship between exercise and the risk of having a miscarriage. Other studies haven't seen an effect either way.

Why are there different risks associated with IVIG and STI treatments? Our results show that there is no difference in the risk of getting gdm between those taking IVIG and those taking STIs. However, because IVIG can cause a longer hospital stay, patients may be offered STI tests","other than major surgery, it is a very minor complication and is treated with various antibiotics.

Q: what does an ectopic pregnancy look like?

Most pregnancies that are carried to term have an ectopic pregnancy, or an incomplete pregnancy (usually called an ectopic due to the lack of an embryo). This causes problems, including shortening of the uterus, birth defects such as spina bifida and Down's syndrome, and sometimes serious health risks. During your pregnancy, you will probably experience some pain during intercourse, but this usually passes quickly. Your baby is born about 28 days after conception when your Fallopian tube is open, and then stays attached to the uterine wall until it is ready to be expelled by the end of the third trimester. After delivery of the placenta, your body begins to produce hormones which cause contraction of the muscles around the uterus causing contractions that can be felt throughout the abdominal cavity. These contractions may feel slightly different from those experienced at birth because they are not connected to the movements of the cervix, so it is important to know how to respond to them. The first contractions of labor often feel uncomfortable but don't last long. It should take less than 2 hours for these contractions to pass, though some women report longer lengths. Thereafter, it is best to relax, rest, or use medication to help ease any discomfort. If your labor continues for more than 2 days and becomes difficult or painful, call your doctor immediately. Most doctors recommend getting medical care if possible before going into labor again."

These are some of the common causes of sinusitis:

Treatment of sinusitis can include rest or medication. You should visit your doctor regularly to check that your condition is improving.

Your doctor may recommend other tests when needed before prescribing medications. Check with your doctor if any of these test results indicate serious problems with your health:

a high level of white blood cells (leukocytes);

a low level of red blood cells (hemoglobin levels) or platelets; or

How do I treat my cold?

There are many different ways to treat a cold. Here are the most important ones:","Heavy flare of a cold sore or sinus infection, like tonsillitis.


If you have chronic back pain, that may be the cause of these symptoms and your doctor will recommend treatment. You may need to limit physical activity for several weeks or months after getting relief from these symptoms to prevent further damage to your body.


Treatment can include rest, medication and lifestyle changes such as diet, exercise, and stress management.


The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) says:

Your immune system is a complex system with many parts that work together in order to protect you against disease. As part of this protection, it has evolved mechanisms to attack bacteria and viruses — both foreign and within our own bodies. These protective defenses include:

- The production of antibodies to fight off invading organisms;

- The release of certain substances called cytokines into your bloodstream in response to infections; and

- A number of other factors that help keep your body's cells healthy.

But not all people experience the same kinds of problems when they get sick. That's why experts say it's important for patients to talk to their doctors about how often they're exposed to certain diseases. Some common conditions that are associated with infections include:

• Influenza/flu

• Meningococcal disease

• Cholera

• Dengue fever

• Lyme disease

• HIV infection

""Most cases of these infections occur during times when there's an increase in exposure,"" said Dr. Joseph Pape, an allergist at Children's Hospital Boston who was one of the first doctors to recognize the risk factor behind asthma attacks, in 1997. ""This means that if we can reduce exposures, we can minimize the possibility of causing illness.""

In addition to using products that contain preservatives that can kill germs, people should avoid:","I have seen it happen to players with my other pets. I'm not sure if they get a flare for that reason, or their skin is really sensitive.


I think in general you should let your pet grow some muscle and gain weight just for the sake of being more comfortable around people. If you're getting ready to go to war or something, don't be too fussy about your pet's size, it may be appropriate after all. And don't be afraid to give your pet lots of exercise - as long as you don't push them too hard.

Heavy flares are a sign of an underlying disease, usually of the lymphatic system. When the cancer has spread to nearby tissue and there's no treatment available, heavy flare can be life-threatening. Heavy flares occur more frequently in men than women, and they tend to happen when you're young or have been taking certain medications for a long time. They may not start until after your last period or just after getting a cold. If you see a significant increase in your symptoms (such as headache, fatigue, joint pain), speak to your doctor.

Treatment For Heavy Flares

Depending on your diagnosis, it may take up to six months before you begin any treatment. Your treatment plans will depend on how severe your flare is. Sometimes doctors use antiviral drugs to try to reduce the amount of inflammation, but other times they recommend surgery. The most common treatment options include:

Antivirals — these help prevent the cells from reacting with the virus. These medicines work by blocking the body's response to viruses. Antiviral therapy also can cause side effects like nausea and vomiting that affect quality of life.

Antiviral therapy also can cause side effects like nausea and vomiting that affect quality of life. Surgery — this surgery removes excess fluid, which helps lower blood pressure and decrease inflammation levels. This operation is often done under general anesthesia. It can only be performed if your condition can't be managed through regular medicine.

Some people choose to stop taking certain medications completely. Some people find relief from opioid medication when they stop taking their painkillers.","light/moderate stinging or burning sensations, especially on the face and feet; some cases of acute lymphadenopathy may occur.

The first thing is to get an MRI, which will help you rule out the cause and determine if there are any problems with your blood vessels or nerves. This may be helpful in diagnosing cancer, but it also helps your doctor make sure there is no other underlying problem. If all else fails, take some vitamin D supplements. This should reduce the amount of redness around your eyes for a short time after exposure to sunlight. Your eye doctor can advise on how much you need depending on your age, health status, sensitivity, etc.


Next, talk to your family doctor or radiologist about whether you have a sunburn. It's very common for people to develop such burns during their lifetime, but they're usually not serious and just fade away without treatment. But if you do develop a burn that lasts longer than three days and causes you discomfort, seek medical attention immediately.


Cancer is one of those things that's hard to predict. The risk depends on many factors, including genetics, how old you are, your family history (how long you've had the disease), and other environmental exposures, like smoking, sunbathing, and occupational exposure. It doesn't mean that sun damage has caused you to develop cancer, only that you are more likely to develop cancer from exposure to certain types of radiation.


Sunscreen use is important because sunscreen acts as a natural antioxidant, absorbing sun light so that it isn't absorbed by the skin, thereby helping prevent cancer. People who wear SPF 30-40 are less likely to get cancer since the UVA rays penetrate the skin easier and stay there longer, making them better candidates for protection. However, studies show that even at higher doses, these products don't actually provide as much protection against cancer as we might expect. They work well, however, when combined with other sunscreens.


Finally, you'll want to keep an eye on your diet. Because UVB rays are most damaging when they come through the air, eating fruits, vegetables, fish, meat, eggs, dairy, nuts, seeds, and olive oil daily reduces the chances of getting damaged by this type of radiation.


In addition to avoiding direct sunlight, try to avoid using tanning beds. These devices heat up the skin by exposing it to ultraviolet rays, causing it to produce increased amounts of melanin, giving your skin a ""natural"" tan. Even though melanin protects against certain","this occurs when your body is exposed to high levels of the chemical carcinogen dioxin.

Heavy Flares in My Tumor? What Can I Do About It?

Dioxin is a chemical that can be found in several types of materials, including automotive exhaust, paints and gasoline. Dioxin has been shown to cause cancer and birth defects in laboratory animals. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies dioxin as a probable human carcinogen. While there are no known effects on humans from exposure to small amounts of dioxin over time or during pregnancy, some people may experience health problems associated with prolonged exposure to high doses of dioxin. This information comes from scientific studies carried out by the EPA and other federal agencies. You should not use any products made from materials containing dioxin unless they have been tested for potential health effects. If you believe that any of your household or work-related chemicals contain dioxin, contact the EPA at 1-800-823-4725.

What Is the Difference between Heavy Flares and Heavy Metals?

Heavy metals are metals that emit strong ultraviolet light called solar radiation. When metal particles absorb sunlight, they become heavier, which increases their chances of scattering off objects and causing damage. But because they do not burn up like other organic compounds, they are less likely than other substances to penetrate skin, and therefore, do not appear on skin biopsy samples. A lot of research shows that it is unlikely that metal particles such as lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, aluminum, chromium and nickel would cause health problems if ingested. However, they do sometimes affect blood vessels in the lungs and other tissues. Because of this concern, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned all aluminum containers, although some manufacturers still recommend using them as drinking water fountains for children aged 2 years and younger. If you decide to keep your child in an aluminum water fountain, do so only after consulting your pediatrician about any potential medical consequences.

How Are Heavy Flares and Metals Used in Household Products?

Flare-producing appliances include gas stoves and cooking ranges. Burning flammable materials such as wood, paper, cardboard, fabric, plastics, glass, rubber, polyurethane, aluminum foil, etc., release toxic gases called hydrocarbons or ""pipes."" These pollutants increase the likelihood of fires, especially if they combine with hot fuels such as oil or natural gas","It depends on the type of flare and how long it's been going for. This is why we usually recommend to see a doctor or get checked out if you've had a very long period of time with symptoms - in some cases, you can't even tell when they started because your body is adapting so quickly. If it was early on, then it probably means there may be something wrong, but just keep looking at the signs and try not to worry too much about them. You could also think that maybe you're under stress and have a lower tolerance for pain. If this is the case, do not give up! Be patient and find another way to manage it.

Eating disorders\nA: These are common, and can include bulimia, anorexia, eating disorder nervosa or binge-eating disorder. They often start as normal weight fluctuations - if you gain more than 2kg over a year, for example, then this may signal that you are having an eating disorder. Many sufferers will also experience depression and anxiety, which can make things worse. Some people have no history of an eating disorder before being diagnosed; others may have a family member who has one. It's important to discuss these issues with your GP, because it can help you determine whether you should go to a specialist or see a dietitian for further assessment.

Health conditions\nA: We all know that heart disease affects everyone differently, although some are known to be more likely than others to develop it. It's important to talk to your doctor or health professional about any symptoms you might have that indicate any underlying condition, such as: high blood pressure

What are the long-term effects?

There is no good data on long-term side effects from CMTs in patients who were previously treated for breast or prostate cancer. However, CMTs can have negative side effects.

In general, these include nausea and vomiting, fatigue, skin changes (such as redness, dryness, itching), hair loss, changes in heart rate, weight gain, changes in blood sugar, and headaches. In some cases, symptoms can last months to years. Many people experience these symptoms within 24 hours after starting treatment. Sometimes these symptoms disappear soon after stopping treatment. Most people who develop them are able to control them without medication or surgery. They do not always occur immediately but can take many months to appear. If they persist, they may require ongoing monitoring by your doctor. For more information about side effects of CMTs, see our page on CMTs.

How is it given?

CMTs should be taken exactly as prescribed by your doctor. You may need to repeat doses every 6 weeks until you feel comfortable. Some people get better quickly; others remain sick for several years because their body's immune system was fighting the disease at that time. It takes time for your body to adjust.

The most common method of giving CMTs is through IV. A syringe needle is placed into your arm and pumped full of medicine through your vein. The drug stays in your bloodstream while you sleep. Your doctor might give you another injection at the same site or use other medicines such as insulin or insulin shots. It can take two to four days for your body to fully adapt. During this time, some side effects can start appearing, including tiredness, blurred vision, nausea, headaches, and sometimes diarrhea. These effects often last less than 10 days before disappearing.

The type of intravenous therapy is important. Different types of therapies work differently and need different amounts of morphine to produce the same results. Certain types of IV treatments are available and are indicated for specific patients. Read each patient's individual instructions carefully so they know how much to expect from their particular treatment plan.

Most women receiving CMTs also receive oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptive pills will prevent pregnancy even if you stop taking CMTs during treatment. Pills must be used for the entire duration of your treatment period."

u: but in my case, it was just about trying to avoid all the pain\p2\qst\r

u: and the only thing I could think to be going through is what I've read on some sites about anti-inflammatory agents or something\p3\qst\r

u: so I tried to stay away from that too.\p4\qst\r

u: And that's probably why I didn't get any eczematous symptoms for quite sometime before.\p5\qst\r

u: But then when I came back and I started getting more eczema, I got really concerned.\p6\qst\r

u: So I got tested for HIV\p7\qst\r

u: which means they would have been able to see that I had the virus\p8\qst\r

u: and that meant that I probably didn't have eczema at all.\p9\qst\r

u: The second test I took after that was a biopsy\p10\qst\r

u: because I knew that the biopsy would show that there was no cancer, just the small amounts of herpes\p11\qst\r

u: that were still around inside me, so I thought it might be better if I could find out why.\p12\qst\r

u: Also I know that it takes longer for your immune system to get used to a new infection than an old one does, so maybe that's why I wasn't getting any eczema or other problems like that until I finally got tested, I don't remember exactly how long it took.\p13\qst\r

u: Anyways, I went to see my doctor again for another checkup, and he told me that he found the virus, but it doesn't seem to be anything serious, so I should go ahead with the treatment plan.\p14\qst\r

u: So I did a couple of things first, to make sure that I'm not taking any medication that could cause any side effects.\p15\qst\r

u: One was just to talk to someone else who had been diagnosed with ecz","but I'm getting more nits, not less!

[23:51] * Erika giggles.

[23:52] <Erik> You're right, I'd like to keep my new hair longer too. It's starting to grow out of control

[23:53] <Erika> But maybe I can get rid of a few things first, in the meantime?

[23:54] <Erika> The second thing is that it would be nice if you could help me with this problem...

[23:55] <Erika> If you do help me, you'll have a chance to ask my parents for some of their old stuff back. They're living quite happily in Sweden now.

[23:56] <Erika> I was looking through their attic just before going home, and saw an odd-looking box sitting on the floor near the TV.

[23:57] <Erika> Then one night when I wasn't expecting it, they threw me into bed without telling me what was in there. When I woke up, everything was gone. I've been trying to track down where it came from ever since, but every time I think about it, I can't find any answers.

[23:58] * Erika looks at the boxes again. She sighs, then tosses them aside. She reaches over, picks up her phone and dials. No answer. She opens the receiver, puts her hand on top of it, and presses it hard against the screen. It buzzes a little before answering. ""Hi?"" A female voice says.

[23:59] <Erika> Hi. Sorry.

[24:00] <Erika> Can I please come inside? Please? Thank you so much for your help.

[24:01] <Erika> Thanks. I really appreciate it.

[24:02] <Erika> Do you mind? I don't want anyone to see this.

[24:03] <Jasmine> Nope, no problems here either, thanks.

[24:04] <Erika> Oh, I'll have one of the housekeepers come by soon, okay?

[24:05] <Erika> Right, we should get moving, since I know I still need to go out in public for some reason. I'll see","I'm fine\u003cbr\u003e \u003cp class=\""font_6\""\u003eI would recommend having a dermatologist check out your skin. If you feel like it's too tight, try using a cream or lotion with an ointment to help control the inflammation. They will also work on both types of eczema.

\u003ch2\u003eWhat can be done for eczema?\u003c\/h2\u003e

\u003cul\u003e

\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe most common treatment for eczema is getting over all of your previous episodes with prescription topical medications (such as paracetamol and ibuprofen). The more you use them, the better they will heal your skin and reduce your overall risk for future flare-ups. You may still have some residual side effects though so do not stop taking any medication until it has healed completely. It's important that you take care of yourself before you start. Be sure to drink enough water and eat lots of fruits and vegetables if you're concerned about possible dehydration. A few extra hours of sleep in between bouts of itching are usually just what you need to get things moving again.

\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is another area where you can see significant improvement without the need for surgery. In fact, it can often improve the itching by itself by giving your body time to adjust. Take two days off of medication (you can take longer) and then return to your usual routine. Your skin should feel normal to the touch once back into regular use. Also note that many people don't fully recover from their episode until several weeks later. This is why it's important to make sure you understand the signs and symptoms of eczema. There are a number of factors that","what?\r

107,Q: medication adhd anxiety\nA:,"no? No, I don't.A: my OCD, not yours. A: it may be, maybe. You may have some other disorder that you think is more important, but there's no way to know what your issue is unless you go in and see a doctor for treatment or get checked out by someone else. And if you've been on meds and found they're no longer working for you...if you haven't seen a doctor for treatment then that's going to cause problems. It could cause a relapse. So it's best to take them off if you can manage it.And remember, even though this will most likely never become an issue with you, if it does then please call me (my number is on the top right of your screen) and tell me what's causing it.

""I'm an anxious teenager who had an episode of my ADHD last weekend and have been feeling a bit low since then. My mother has been taking me to see an endocrinologist recently and she has told me that my condition is probably genetic so if I don't get better soon i may have to have a hysterectomy.""

My name's Darlene, I'm 16 (aged 14). I got my first hyperactive/impulsive disorder when i was 12 years old due to a head injury at school and a combination of poor parenting skills and an environment where there wasn't much space for us to learn on our own. I've always wanted to be a doctor but in order to do that I needed a degree and a job as they're not available in most places or I might never earn enough money to afford it, which also means I would never go into medicine.

Since my ADHD started it feels like it's been getting worse and worse. I spend a lot of time watching TV but haven't really done anything else to try and stop it until now. I went to see a specialist once, a GP and psychiatrist who could give me some advice on treatment and how far along I am with my medication. They said I need to take something like Ritalin 3 times a day for 6 months and give it up after 6 months unless I can get a new prescription from my GP because they have no idea what's going on with my symptoms. I didn't want to do that and the GP and psychiatrist agreed that they did give me an option but only if I take it by myself.

Do you know anyone who will help me understand what is happening? Is any medication available that helps with things like the way my brain works? What are my options? Will I have to take something like that again in 6 months? I mean I'll be 17 in November so i won't be 19 before then. Thank you so much!""


The person above answered:""There is NO cure for ADD, although research suggests that stimulant medications such as Ritalin can lead to longer life span.""


(From a person called ""B"")

So, does anyone have a link between ADD and autism? I think we should talk about it more. Thanks for your thoughts!

Hi Darlene. Yes there is research linking ADD to autism.","yes, but if you are depressed or anxious or have a serious health issue it may be better to avoid the prescription drug. (5)

The researchers said there is evidence for many benefits of stimulants such as methamphetamine and methylphenidate for treating mental illness. They note that several studies suggest that these drugs reduce symptoms of depression. For example, they wrote, ""Several lines of evidence show that treatment with antidepressants increases brain concentrations of 5-HT2B [serotonin 2C receptor], which has been associated with a decreased risk of depression in both animal and human models.""

However, the authors noted, this effect was more pronounced when researchers used the drugs after first taking a placebo, a phenomenon known as an ""after-treatment"" study. This was particularly true if users also took other medications to help them cope with their problems.

To test whether the effects would persist even in patients who took the drugs two weeks later, the researchers measured the activity of serotonin receptors in brain cells exposed to amphetamine, methamphetamine, and methylphenidate. Afterward, they detected decreases in some serotonin receptors in those treated with the drugs versus those not given them. But, they added, this effect persisted only up to eight days after stopping the drugs; at least for this group, however, it did not return to baseline levels within 16 hours.

This finding suggests that even after the initial antidepressant effects wear off, users' brains might still respond to amphetamines by changing their neuronal activity patterns.

""This could explain why individuals who take amphetamine on a regular basis experience adverse effects,"" said Dr. David C. Biederman, professor and chair of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. He called this research ""a big advance because this is a really good result showing that amphetamine does change brain function following exposure to its active metabolite.""

But he cautioned that the findings do not mean that all people should stop using stimulant drugs, nor that there is no benefit from taking them occasionally.

""That's just speculation,"" he said.","any of the following [drugs, alcohol] \nB: other drugs, alcohol, or anabolic steroids. \b\nC: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [eg ibuprofen, naproxen, celecoxib], corticosteroids [ie steroids such as prednisone and cyclosporine], blood pressure medications [eg diuretics, ACE inhibitors], and pain medications [eg NSAIDs]. \r

a loss of appetite

excessive sweating

depression

feeling sad, worthless, or hopeless, especially after something bad happens in life

fearful thoughts and feelings

difficulty concentrating or remembering things

worrying about future events

irritability

aggressive behaviors

A: before it was fine, even when I played offline, I would still get into trouble. After the update my luck got better. I didn't lose much time playing because I could make friends easily. Q: do you think you can really be in debt all your life? A: I am not sure if I will ever be able to pay off my debts someday. But I think I can manage it for now. Q: how long were you playing it? A: Since its beta. When it started getting really popular, I started having some fun, then I stopped. Q: why don't you join a team again? A: Because I hate being on a team with other people, I have more freedom. If I don't want to be a part of a group that needs someone else to talk to, I'll quit. Q: when you play online, can't you use voice chat? A: Yes, but I think you should just talk to one another by yourself. You might be surprised, but using voice chat requires quite a bit of concentration, especially for online games. So if you're like me, you're probably already tired from typing.

I'm a big fan of the 'not all women' attitude. It gives women who suffer from depression a voice that isn't always heard. I think if we see more self care, support and compassion towards ourselves, our family and friends, there will be less of an urge to isolate others. I'm also a huge fan of helping people who aren't 'bad', i.e. people who are struggling just enough to live with, but are still trying hard enough to become happy. When we're out alone together it becomes very easy to turn against each other, when we've been apart, even though we may seem pretty close now.

I will continue to use them until the end of the year.Q: Have any friends or family members told you about your condition or helped you along the way?A: Yes. My boyfriend had a few people talk to him about my problems before my mother found out (she was already aware). She knew enough of the symptoms that she said ""It sounds like a serious problem.""

So I guess I can thank her for letting me know that she knows and that she cares!Q: Do you think there's anything wrong with having ADHD and being an anxious person?A: Yeah, definitely. But as I stated above, it could have something to do with genetics or upbringing. If my mom hadn't known about my condition, then I probably wouldn't have found myself in such dire straits. But by knowing that she knew, I realized that I wasn't alone.

Briefly, the symptoms of IBS are similar to those described in children with gastrointestinal disorders. For example, the GI tract can become irritated (diarrhea) and swollen (fever). The stomach may not be able to hold food well because it is still full after eating, or the intestines may have difficulty digesting a meal. Irritation may also occur if the digestive system is disrupted by infection (such as from food poisoning). However, patients also experience these symptoms when there is no specific cause for their symptoms, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease. In some cases, they may have a specific medical condition that causes their symptoms, such as an autoimmune disorder.

For people who develop acute IBS during pregnancy or early childhood, some researchers believe that this may be a result of poor diet or inadequate nutrition in the mother's diet. Additionally, some pregnant women do not receive proper breastfeeding support. These factors may contribute to IBS development and worsen the outcome.

The diagnosis of IBS must be confirmed through physical examination, laboratory testing, or imaging studies. In addition, information on other health conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, or obesity) should be included to help the clinician determine whether it might be related to IBS.","ˈpəlʊt͡iː.o/ (see )

It should be safe, well-tolerated (not harmful), not habit forming, nonpharmacologic, nonselective and not abuse resistant as it may have been when used in humans prior to supplementation. In addition, a dietary supplement must meet all applicable safety requirements including those related to human consumption, use in animals and adequate dosages of active ingredients for absorption.

FDA Approval Information The Food and Drug Administration has cleared this drug for the treatment of depression due to clinical trials conducted at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center. This drug was initially evaluated in a pilot study conducted at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine from January 2004 through June 2007 and has shown promising results. Since that time, this drug has continued to be administered in a small randomized controlled trial performed at the National Institute on Aging in Bethesda, MD. The FDA approved the antidepressant drug Paxil® as an antidepressant to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) in 2012 in a marketing application known as PLOS ONE ®. A full list of product approvals can be found at www.fda.gov/cder/drugs/labeling/.

Paxil® is intended for use only in patients who are 18 years of age or older, with no history of psychiatric disorders, seizures, diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, hyperthyroidism, or asthma; taking medications, other than SSRIs and SNRI's (anti-depressants); or experiencing suicidal ideation or attempts during the preceding 12 months. Patients should begin Paxil within 48 hours after stopping any current antidepressants (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, tricyclic antidepressants with tricyclic oxyphenylalanine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors). If Paxil fails to improve symptoms of depression, discuss the possibility of switching to another antidepressant with your healthcare provider. Patients should continue to monitor their condition closely and be prepared to discontinue Paxil if needed. If Paxil does not improve symptoms of depression, you may wish to consider using another antidepressant medication such as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). These medications often take several weeks to stabilize and will also require monitoring. Your healthcare provider can provide further","acute and long term nausea/vomiting, malaise, abdominal pain, or headache hyperactive behavior tremor (seizures) apathy, confusion, irritability lupus erythematous ulceration of skin/fatty tissue

Treatment[7][8] A combination of a high dose intravenous glucose solution followed by oral insulin has been shown to be the most effective treatment for patients with idiopathic hypersensitivity syndrome. It is recommended that all patients receiving this therapy have at least two independent stool samples collected every five days during their hospitalization period. This can be done using an alternative method of collection such as rectal swab examination or fecal testing.[9] The exact concentration of insulin administered should be adjusted according to patient response. Treatment duration varies from several hours to weeks depending on the severity of symptoms. Patients with mild reactions are often able to continue for longer periods while those with severe reactions require more frequent blood draws. If there is evidence of increased risk for complications in patients treated with insulin injections, then it may be advisable to discontinue treatment.[10][11]


Possible Side Effects[12] Allergic Reactions - Inflammation of the lining of the intestines, especially around the jejunum and inside the colon; also known as peritonitis and endocarditis. [13] It usually resolves within a few days but may take longer depending upon the nature of the infection or underlying medical condition. These inflammatory changes can affect the gastrointestinal tract or liver and can cause abdominal pain and jaundice. [14] Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)[15] - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), include Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and other intestinal disorders like IBS. There are many different forms including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Crohn's disease is considered to be the leading type of IBD and its causes include bacteria from the GI tracts. Ulcers and ulcerative colitis are also caused by bacteria from the GI tract. Symptoms include cramps, bleeding, swelling and tenderness. Some cases lead to loss of function in various organs such as the liver and spleen. In rare cases, people who develop ulcers might lose the ability to digest food. They can also suffer from weight loss and fatigue. Chronic inflammation of the intestine and colon can be part of the pathogenesis of these conditions. These types of diseases tend to go away once antibiotics are started to treat the underlying issue(","acute illness, especially respiratory system disorder (e.g., pneumonia) acute allergic reaction and/or hypersensitivity allergy a persistent headache or other sensory symptom

I'm in the middle of a severe outbreak of botulism, but I've been eating foods that are safe for me to eat. How do I prevent myself from developing the same symptoms?

A: A recent article published by New York Times Health columnist David Katzmayer noted that the food you are consuming is ""not necessarily what's causing your symptoms."" He goes on to say that there may be more than one factor at play, including factors like age, gender and health history. If you suspect your symptoms are related to a toxin and have not yet visited a doctor, it may help to consult with your allergist to determine if an alternative food source might be acceptable. You can also find information about alternative sources of protein, such as legumes, dairy products, nuts and seeds, or even nutritional supplements. The bottom line is that while it doesn't hurt to limit yourself from consuming certain types of food, avoiding any food group will almost certainly increase your chances of being healthy and avoidable complications. For example, some people who suffer from fibromyalgia report that they often get flu-like symptoms when they consume gluten-free pasta or breads. This can lead them to stop drinking milk because their stomachs become upset after drinking it. In this case, the problem isn't actually the gluten itself; instead, the acidity of the milk contributes to the discomfort. But if the acidity of the milk keeps you feeling ill, then it seems wise to cut out the milk entirely—at least temporarily. This type of advice is best used only when both the cause and cure seem reasonable and your symptoms remain manageable.

Can I make my own probiotic pills? Are these safe for children and pregnant women?

A: While some parents use probiotics (usually yogurt) for the prevention of diseases like bacterial infections and yeast overgrowth in the gut, it is important to note that they aren't good for anyone other than those with the right microbes. Some experts suggest using different kinds of probiotics depending on whether you're trying to lower your risk of allergies, constipation or lactose intolerance. According to Dr. Peter Attia, M.D., a gastroenterologist at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City, a good strategy is to take probiotics on an empty stomach. This way, you don't produce gas and keep the bacteria in","acute liver failure (dyspnea, flushing, confusion) hypogonadism HLA genes: C677T>C, F508R, G551V (antibodies to erythromycin) polycystic ovary syndrome, hyperandrogenemia pyloric stenosis PMS-associated pancreatitis Pregnancy and lactation Pruritus Prostate problems (particularly impotence) pregnancy-induced breast cancer (prostatite carcinoma in situ) pyelonephritis pseudomembranous colitis, oropharyngeal ulcers Sjögren's syndrome, SMA syndrome (genetic disorder) staphylococcal infection Syphilis stress-related cancers tinnitus Torsion tremor trachoma tinea pedis Tuberculosis tularemia Tuberculoid syndrome Urethral cancer Vascular disease Vitamin A deficiency

Symptoms

People who are taking medications like this can experience problems with their moods, anxiety and energy levels. Sometimes these symptoms become so severe they impair people's ability to drive, work, attend school, or do other activities necessary for daily life.

Cerebral palsy, which affects most children born after 1945, is another type of epilepsy associated with low thyroid function. People may have trouble regulating the way their arms move, particularly when trying to open doors, climb stairs, or use wheelchairs. They may also be unable to speak due to motor neuron disease, as well as having difficulty moving their legs without help from braces or other devices designed to stabilize them during movement.

HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C infection can cause seizures and sometimes brain damage. While most people don't notice any significant side effects of iodine deficiency until it's too late, some are very uncomfortable at first, causing them to avoid foods containing high concentrations of iodine.

Risk factors

You're more likely to develop a condition related to thyroid dysfunction if you already have certain genetic conditions — like hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism — or if your parents were diagnosed with either one before birth.

But there's no evidence that people who've had thyroid surgery or lived near an active chemical plant or refinery will suffer similar health problems. And studies suggest that even moderate exposure to iodine might reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases by about 20 percent.

When to see a doctor

Seek medical attention if you think you have thyroid disease. Your doctor will probably perform a physical exam on you to measure your potassium level and try to rule out other problems such as blood clots and rheumatoid arthritis.

Causes

The exact causes of thyroid dysfunction aren't entirely clear, but researchers believe that a loss of potassium in the bloodstream plays a role. In most cases, the process of deiodination occurs slowly; however, in people with elevated levels, it takes longer than normal for potassium to disappear from the circulation and return to its resting state.

In people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, for example, thyroid hormones may bind too tightly to certain proteins in the liver and ultimately interfere with proper metabolism. The resulting buildup of lactic acid in","anxiety and depression hyperkinesis

The effects of the drug are similar to those seen with other antihistamines, such as Chlorpromazine. But unlike these drugs, Glucophage does not cause nausea or vomiting. A single oral dose will relieve most cases of gastrointestinal symptoms. For people who suffer from severe abdominal pain, however, it is best to begin treatment with a larger dose once they have fully recovered.

Glucophage also works quickly and effectively for most types of asthma attacks and allergic rhinitis (anaphylaxis). Patients should be treated within 30 minutes after first feeling an attack of any type. If an attack occurs while people are sleeping, they should take glucophage before bedtime to help block the release of histamine in their bloodstreams.

Because of its fast action and ease of use, glucophage can be used at home or in offices without making a trip out to the pharmacy. When starting therapy, you may want to ask your doctor about using this drug only when necessary. Your doctor might suggest that you follow up with a few more doses if you experience signs of increased intolerance during treatment.","a) n. 1.

PNS (pancreatic insufficiency)

Symptoms: Diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, bloating, and fatigue.


Treatment: DNP is a diuretic with limited effect on pancreatic enzymes; the only treatment for POTS is a low-sodium diet to reduce potassium levels, which are an important source of water in this disorder. The aim is to lower these levels by replacing them with ketones or fat from food or supplements.

The effects of dosing on blood sugar levels are not well established. It has been suggested that long term exposure might lead to hyperglycemia[10]. However, it seems unlikely that low doses of DNP will cause hypoglycemic symptoms if used properly. A study using 6 mg/day gave no adverse side effects; the dose given was much higher than usual, but there were no serious complications reported. In addition, the drug was administered as intravenous injections, which may have increased the risk of bleeding and infection.

For those without significant liver disease or diabetes, DNP should be considered as part of a weight loss programme.[11] For people with liver problems, it may be recommended to use insulin for control.[12]

Dietary restrictions (including restricting carbohydrate intake) should be implemented when prescribed dosing. Low carb diets tend to raise serum glucose levels significantly[13][14], so caution must be taken.

In patients with kidney disorders, such as dialysis, a high protein diet may be needed for optimal health. This depends upon individual circumstances.

Nausea and vomiting [ edit ]

This is very common in POTS and can be seen on some symptom checklists. Symptoms include abdominal cramping, abdominal distention, and nausea. If you suspect this condition, consult your doctor.

POTS (polycystic ovaries), also known as polycystic ovaries syndrome, is a complex disease. There are at least two types of POTS:[15]

Type 1: Ovarian dysfunction causes excessive production of oestrogen and leads to an excess of male hormones. When treated correctly, all signs of this type of disease disappear.

POTS Pregnancy / Misc. Mood/Loss/Cravings: I'm a bit concerned about this, but I also know it's not really that bad. We just have to be careful with our diet and exercise. It's pretty common for us at night when we're sleepy to get up and stretch out or go for a walk and not feel anything in the legs. In other words, if you have the symptoms, then they are probably more of an early onset than a delayed one. I'm going to try and do some research on what else may help me and maybe share my experiences here as well. Thanks!

The last 2 are very rare and do not usually show up until 5-6 months after a diagnosis of PMS has been made. I think that's why it can be so difficult to diagnose because you have no idea what it means to get these symptoms. You also don't know whether this is just a coincidence or if there is some underlying cause for the symptoms. POTS is only one symptom in PMS which can include fatigue, headaches, light sensitivity, sleep problems, mood swings, low energy levels, irritability and depression. It is important to find out what causes PMS and what happens during pregnancy (and postpartum) so that you can manage your health and feel better. There is a lot we don't understand about PMS and how it affects women's health and ability to work and socialize with others. We need more research and education on this subject! -Jennifer

PTSD is not caused by any medication. However, many people get it because of eating too much sugar and/or processed foods such as sugared cereal or fried food. The symptoms can include a loss of appetite (insomnia), tiredness, headache, weight gain, blurred vision, and other neurological problems like headaches, seizures, and weakness. This condition is usually treatable with diet, but there are some treatments to improve the quality of life.


What causes this?

The causes of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome are unknown. It's most often seen in children who have been treated for type 1 diabetes or pre-diabetes before they're diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. A genetic predisposition may also contribute to the disorder. In adults, the cause isn't known. Some scientists think that some form of environmental toxins may cause the disease.


How does Ehlers Danlos Syndrome affect your everyday life?

People with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome have a high risk of developing cancer. The risk increases when you develop osteoarthritis, kidney failure, or heart disease; these conditions all increase your chance of having the condition. Your body doesn't make enough thyroid hormone so its effects on your health may be more severe than usual. If your doctor suspects the condition is linked to thyroid disorders, he might recommend monitoring your blood levels of thyroxine to see if your level is increasing or decreasing. Also, try taking a daily thyroid supplement. Thyroid medications don't work well if taken at the same time as your regular diet.


When is Ehlers Danlos Syndrome diagnosed?

Ehlers Danlos Syndrome diagnosis is usually made after an individual has had two symptoms that are associated with that person's medical history. These types of symptoms should be evaluated separately. Most cases of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome aren't diagnosed until adulthood. So how long does Ehlers Danlos Syndrome last?

Since the onset of symptoms, approximately 25% of people will experience at least one more symptom, which may involve either fatigue, backache, joint stiffness, muscle weakness, dizziness, depression, numbness, or other symptoms lasting several weeks or months. While the majority of people with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome don't progress beyond the initial symptoms, those who do tend to lose interest in activities where their muscles are involved, such as climbing trees, swinging from bars, driving, working out, running in hot weather, and exercising while outdoors. Since there is no treatment available","???????:?????\nA:????????\r

112,Q: symptoms of asthma\nA:,"it has to do with the way that your airways are lined and how mucus moves between them. For example, if you have a lot of mucus and an increase in water pressure within your lungs, that can cause asthma symptoms. Some people develop allergies or other breathing problems.

3. My child's asthma is getting worse. What should I do?

Your doctor will evaluate whether asthma may be causing your child's symptoms. If your child does not respond to treatment, you might try using different medications or giving your child special dietary supplements. See your doctor for more information about this topic.

4. How common is severe allergic rhinitis (anaphylaxis)?

The exact number varies by age. The National Institutes of Health estimates that up to 3 percent of children ages 1–6 years have severe allergic rhinitis.[1]

5. Do all children get bronchial asthma?

All kids who receive oxygen therapy experience some sort of adverse reaction. Most often these reactions are mild—for instance, sneezing or shortness of breath. But sometimes they are life-threatening, such as chest tightness or trouble breathing. Sometimes serious complications occur; for example, heart attack or stroke, coma, or death. These types of adverse reactions usually affect only one person in 10,000 people.

Some kinds of severe allergic reactions require hospitalization. Serious cases can result in death.

It is important to keep allergic conditions under close observation. Talk with your pediatrician if you think your child has had any type of problem, including an allergic reaction, since he or she was younger than 2 years old.

In general, most kids who experience any kind of allergic event from inhaling things like pollen, dander, dust mites, mold, peanuts, and tree nuts don't need emergency care. However, you may wish to talk with your child's allergist about the best course of action for him or her. Your child's allergist may recommend that your child undergo an allergy test or that your child avoid certain foods, especially during times when there are seasonal allergies.","as little as you can.

4) When do we get the flu? How long should I wait to see a doctor for it?

Your doctor will check your breathing and body temperature before they start treatment with antihistamines or steroid medications, but sometimes the first signs of the flu are mild enough that you don't need to wait until your next appointment. But when the symptoms become severe, you'll probably want to go see a doctor immediately. The flu is a serious illness that puts you at risk for other health problems, so getting treated early gives you an opportunity to prevent further complications from these infections. And getting tested for flu is also important because if it's caught early, you can avoid having an infection (or worse). So, be sure to seek medical care right away if your cough gets very bad, especially if you're already feeling feverish.

5) My asthma isn't causing me any problems, but my breathing sounds more like that of someone who has bronchitis. What could this mean?

The best way to determine whether something may be bothering you is to take some time off work or school to spend time with family and friends. If you have any symptoms (such as wheezing, chest tightness, coughing), consider taking a short vacation (but only one day a week — not three consecutive days!). You might also try a different medication. For example, the medicine cholestyramine helps ease symptoms such as pain and congestion in the lungs but doesn't actually clear up the underlying cause of the condition.

If you suspect you have asthma, ask your doctor about the best treatments. Cholestyramine is the most commonly prescribed drug for this type of respiratory disease. This is what you'll usually find on your prescription label:

CHLENTRAMINE

mild to moderate acute exacerbation (including cough; nasal congestion; shortness of breath or difficulty keeping a stable airway);


bronchospasm (chest discomfort or tenderness; shortness of breath or inability to breathe without help).

You may also encounter names like ""benzodiazepines,"" which include benzodiazepines, alcohol and painkillers. These drugs are often used to treat anxiety disorders, and you may have been given them by a doctor to help relieve stress. Benzos aren't recommended if you have asthma and could potentially worsen the conditions they're intended to treat.

6) I'm still being asked questions by my allergist during","an abnormal or unhealthy response to a drug (not necessarily medical) that may be caused by stress, illness, and/or pregnancy.

Treatment Edit

The treatments are usually more effective when administered during the first few days after infection. These treatments include oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, inhaled corticosteroids, and inhaler therapy. The most common type of treatment is given with an aerosol of antibiotics in a plastic bag.

Sick patients who receive IV antibiotics at home are often treated with oral rehydration salts. Because this medication can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, it must be delivered through a vein in a patient's arm instead of via a nasal tube. This is commonly used because it allows for easy monitoring and control of blood pressure and pulse rate. This is especially important in children under 5 years old whose circulation is limited due to low growth. Children need not have had their eyes washed before receiving an IV antibiotic injection. When using this method, a pediatrician should evaluate the child's heart and lungs prior to administering the medication.

Other methods are also available to treat asthma, including:

Oral steroids: these injections are taken orally for several weeks until they become ineffective. They help alleviate bronchial congestion, which sometimes causes difficulty breathing, but not much improvement.

Respiratory support: This involves providing artificial respiration as needed. In very rare cases, this may be necessary to improve the respiratory tract.

This involves providing artificial respiration as needed. In very rare cases, this may be necessary to improve the respiratory tract.

Antihistamines : A small number of people take anticholinergics to try to reduce their sensitivity to allergens such as pollen or dust mites. However, many allergic reactions occur from only one side effect; even if there are no other symptoms associated with this practice, the potential adverse effects still outweigh its benefits. It is best to avoid the use of these drugs","see allergy.

The best way to determine if your child has asthma is by asking them to stand in front of the mirror or close their eyes while they breathe into a sealed airway. If it smells bad or something is coming out of their nose, take them back to their doctor. There are many different types of asthma that affect kids. It may be bronchial, chronic, or food-related asthma (food allergies). In most cases, they will respond to an inhaled corticosteroid, but they will also respond to oral medications for short periods of time (up to five days) as well. Most children get better after the first dose of an inhaler. For more information on what you should do, visit the American Academy of Pediatrics website.

Asthma treatment can cause side effects which can include headaches, dizziness, sleep problems, increased appetite, depression, nausea, difficulty breathing, coughing up blood, and even death. These potential complications are very real. While these symptoms are usually mild and resolve within weeks of stopping treatment, there can be long-lasting changes in health that are not reversible. Therefore, the decision about whether or not to continue treatment depends on your child's overall condition, age, and activity level. Consult with a pediatrician before making any major decisions about your child's health.

What causes Asthma?

Inhalation asthma occurs when the lining of the lungs becomes inflamed, causing congestion. The body produces mucus, which helps regulate breathing. When this mucus builds up over time and becomes thickened, it becomes difficult to clear from the lungs because it clogs the airways and blocks them completely. Once blocked, the lungs cannot expand as much and the patient will become unresponsive. Symptoms include wheezing, cough, runny nose, and chest tightness. Children who live in areas where airborne pollutants and toxins are higher than average have a greater risk of developing asthma. This includes tobacco smoke, mold, pesticides, and other chemicals found in homes and workplaces.

Food allergy is another common type of asthmatic disease. It occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the small intestine during digestion or absorption of foods. This leads to swelling of the intestines. This happens in some people due to certain foods such as peanuts, eggs, soybeans, wheat, shellfish, fish, and nuts. Other symptoms could include","the disease of asthma. A person has an allergic reaction to something, such as pollen or dust in air. This can be physical (hives), mental (anxiety) or social (happiness).

What is asthma?

The lungs are the main organ that breathe oxygen and carbon dioxide into the body. People with allergies have a type of immune system called the ""allergic"" response which responds by producing substances known as immunoglobulins. These antibodies can cause an allergic reaction when they come into contact with certain substances. For example, if someone's saliva gets onto a piece of clothing containing allergens, it might make them itch. The itchiness may last for days or weeks after washing off. Some people find their skin itching even more if they smell foods, such as peanut butter and dairy products, during allergy season. Asthma is usually not serious but some people experience shortness of breath or breathing problems. If you have asthma, your doctor will need to check out your symptoms every few months and may prescribe medication to help control your condition. It could also mean that you get lots of tests.

Symptoms of asthma

Asthma occurs most often in children. However, adults with asthma may also develop this condition. Although there are no specific signs or symptoms, people who have asthma may complain about breathing difficulties including wheezing or coughing, difficulty breathing, sore throat or chest tightness, chest pain, shortness of breath or shortness of breath at rest or while standing up.

How do I know what kind of asthma my child has?

Your child should see his/her GP (general practitioner) within 21 days of being diagnosed with an asthma attack. An asthma attack can happen at any time of the year so it is important to check with your GP before going on holiday or going on holidays. You'll probably only be asked about a child's recent asthma attack, rather than whether your child had one in the past. In addition, an attack isn't always obvious, so your GP may ask to see photos or videos to show how an attack feels. Your child won't usually tell you anything about the attack itself.

If your child hasn't had an attack recently, he/she will likely be asked to keep records of his/her symptoms and any special circumstances you think may be causing them. An asthma attack may look similar to other types of attacks but will often differ from what someone else experiences. For example, someone with hayfever may cough or sne","any disease or condition resulting from inflammation in the airways.

The most common symptom is wheezing, usually when you cough or sneeze during breathing and chest pain at rest. If your body produces too much mucus to help fight off infection, it can produce a thick sticky substance called phlegm that sticks to the walls of the lungs (called ""airway secretions""). This thick substance blocks the flow of oxygen through the blood vessels, making breathing difficult.

When this happens, asthma sufferers experience shortness of breath, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, runny nose, and wheezing. Over time, these changes may develop into more serious conditions such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema, which are characterized by thickened blood vessels, increased lung capacity, difficulty swallowing, and other health problems.","the symptoms generally are not severe, but can be more troublesome. For example, they may include difficulty breathing and/or chest pain. These often occur within a short time after exposure to ozone or other pollutants.

Q: What causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? A: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is caused by prolonged breathing in certain airways that cause problems with oxygen-carrying lungs. This type of lung disease usually develops at an early age. The condition is very serious and usually requires treatment by medical professionals. People with COPD have trouble working and have problems sleeping because their breathing problem can interfere with sleep. Treatment options for people who develop COPD include medication and therapy to help keep their breath moving properly. The medications used to treat COPD can affect your body's ability to breathe; this includes medicines called inhaled steroids, oral bronchodilators, inhalers, sedatives, diuretics, and others.

Q: How does respiratory infection spread from person to person? A: Airborne infections typically can't hurt someone unless it gets into the bloodstream through a cut or wound or if its airborne particles get into the mucus membranes of the mouth and nose. However, some viruses spread easily from one person to another. Examples include influenza, rhinovirus, cytomegalovirus, noroviruses, rubella virus, parainfluenza viruses, measles virus, human papillomavirus, shigellosis, hepatitis B, smallpox, rotavirus, Ebola virus, herpes simplex virus, and yellow fever virus.","it can also be related to a number of other medical conditions. It may be caused by an imbalance between the body's natural, or inhaled, gases and gases produced from the body, including the air we breathe in and out. There are two main types of asthma that affect children: bronchitis and wheezing, which is often referred to as wheezing in children and wheeze in adults. Most children with asthma have either one or both of these problems. Children with the most common form of wheezing in children are called ""wheezing attacks"" and they start at about 1-2 years old and last for less than a minute (about 5 seconds). In those who do not respond well to medication or who do not get better quickly, these episodes can become longer, lasting up to 2 hours and sometimes several days. The same type of breathing problems are known as asthmatic attacks in adults, although some people develop them while pregnant or breastfeeding. These attacks usually occur every few minutes during waking time but are typically short - usually only a couple of minutes long. They come on suddenly, starting with a short gasp before gradually becoming more pronounced until they feel like a full on huff or puff. You will know you've had an attack when you cough and stuff your nose. An attack can happen very fast if it has started earlier than usual. If you think you or someone else is having an attack and don't immediately get help, you could pass on this condition to your child.

Symptoms \nB: what causes asthma? A child with asthma develops a chronic lung disease that changes their lungs over many months. This means that as they grow older their lungs change as well. As the child grows older, there are fewer areas in their lungs where they produce airways which makes it harder to clear mucus from their respiratory tract (respiratory tract). As the child gets older, the area around the mouth becomes more prominent and hard to clean. When a young child starts to cough or sneeze or has trouble breathing, they might call their parents or doctor and ask for assistance. Over time, asthma worsens with age because the child's immune system starts attacking its own tissues instead of just those in their lungs. People with asthma get different kinds of symptoms depending on whether they live near homes with lots of pollen, smoke, pet dander or dust mites, or where they were born (birthplaces). Most people living close to places where there are lots of these things tend to"

Symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness, difficulty in breathing, coughing, chest pain, confusion, drowsiness, and fatigue.

A: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a chronic lung disorder that affects airways, causes the lungs to become more inflamed than normal, leading to pneumonia, bronchitis, emphysema, and other complications. It may also cause changes in the structure of the body's immune system. COPD affects approximately 10 million Americans annually with an average age of 60. The average life expectancy for people who have COPD is between 40 and 50 years.

B: lung cancer is the second most common form of cancer among all cancers in men and women aged 15 to 74 years old. Lung cancer accounts for 23% of all deaths from cancer worldwide. It is the second-leading cause of death from malignant neoplasms after prostate cancer. In 2010 there were about 30,000 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed each year in the United States. Among females, lung cancer is more prevalent than breast cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. About 19,700 lung cancer patients die from it every year.

C: lung cancer is one of the top three cancer killers in young adults ages 25–44 years old. While lung cancer remains the number one killer of these groups, men are still much more likely to be affected by the disease than women. For example, men age 55 and older account for nearly 70% of new cases of lung cancer diagnosed during 2005–2010. However, if you live in a county in which women outnumber men, your chance of being affected by this risk factor increases to over 90%.

D: lung cancer is the second deadliest type of cancer in both sexes. It occurs in more than 6% of all cancers diagnosed. As of January 2011, the mortality rate was almost 33,300 per 100,000 persons. Approximately 4% of lung cancer survivors will continue to develop it into their 80s or later; 1% of lung cancer patients will remain with it into their 80s or later. About 13% of those surviving from lung cancer will require chemotherapy treatment to cure the disease.

References","of which the most important factor is the amount of oxygen intake. The second is the duration or type of breath hold (eg, diaphragmatic). 3-B. A person's breath holds on a treadmill are classified into three categories: 1) short breaths (ie, 8 seconds); 2) long breaths (ie, 20 to 30 seconds); 3) long continuous breaths (ie, 45 seconds). 4. Long continuous breaths are defined as those that last at least one minute, while short continuous breaths take less than two minutes. 5. A person who takes too much time in taking a breath hold is said to have an ""excessive"" respiration rate. 6. In exercising people, breathing patterns change over the course of a workout; some individuals exhale faster than others, while other individuals breathe slower. 7. A person who exercises more intensely with longer breaths may develop chest tightness due to decreased oxygen delivery. This has been shown by research to be associated with heart disease risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, elevated LDL-cholesterol levels, hypertension, and obesity. 8. Breathing habits can also vary from one individual to another and may affect their ability to exercise. 9. When working out, it helps if there is a steady flow of air through your mouth during each breath hold. 10. For a healthy body to be able to endure all the stress you put it under, it needs adequate oxygen supply. 11. It is essential for anyone who is fit to perform strenuous activities and recover quickly afterwards. 12. If the body does not get sufficient oxygen through the skin and lungs, then it will eventually go into respiratory distress and die. 13. Breathing habits can also vary across different cultures and races. 14. You should never work out in a room where there is no air conditioning! 15. Some exercises require both active and passive components, so they need to be performed differently depending on what is needed. 16. There are some common misconceptions about how many calories you burn when doing aerobic activities. The true number is estimated at around 1500 - 1800 kcal per hour (2kcal/min).

How do I know if my training burns fat?

To find out if your training burns fat, use a calorie counter to measure your daily calories burned. Find the numbers corresponding to your age group and gender and compare them to the same figures for someone in your age bracket and gender. Next, subtract the difference between these figures and the total number of calories burned by this activity.

A good question to ask is whether your symptoms have been triggered by exposure to these ingredients. Most people will be allergic to one ingredient in a product and not all ingredients. For example, you may be allergic to parabens and not allergic to phthalates. If so, you should probably avoid these products. But if you are very sensitive to them, you may want to use a safer product.

Is there anything that you would like to share with us about your experience with children's healthcare? A: The greatest benefit of my time at Children's Hospital was being able to help so many families who were not as fortunate as I am. I met some amazing people, I learned a lot, and saw firsthand how much work goes into caring for an infant and toddler. 3. As you may know, we have recently begun offering parents the option to purchase supplemental insurance for their child(ren), which allows them to receive medical care without having to worry about getting out of debt, losing their job, and so on. As such, we have noticed an increase in parents contacting our office asking if they can buy a separate policy when their youngest child has a health issue; whether it be pneumonia, ear infections, or just general discomfort. Many parents are concerned that this will lead to a significant increase in costs. We hope you will agree that, if necessary, these extra costs may have to be paid by the child's family. 4.

""In order for lung cancer to spread,"" said Dr. John C. O'Keefe III, chief medical officer at Cleveland Clinic, ""it must become established in both lungs."" Because it is an advanced form of cancer, there are only two methods for screening for it today: by using biopsy samples from the lung itself (to detect malignant cells) or by measuring the amount of protein in the tissue samples obtained when lung cancer has been detected through other means (such as by imaging techniques). The test used to determine whether someone has lung cancer is known as the Lymphoma Screening Test (LSST), which was first developed in 1968 and is commonly called the lung-cancer screen. If you have had your lung tested recently but do not have symptoms, you can take the LSST just before you go into surgery. A sample will be sent to a laboratory, where it will be analyzed for the presence of lung tumors by a combination of molecular tests. When you return home from surgery and are asked what you ate, you can answer this question honestly, but if you don't remember anything about yesterday's meal, it won't tell much about your risk of developing lung cancer. But even if you know something about your diet, it doesn't mean you're more likely to develop lung cancer than someone who hasn't had their diagnosis yet.

The main reason people with lung cancer get caught earlier is because they live longer. They tend to stay healthy for a while after diagnosis until symptoms emerge, although the average life expectancy for men with lung cancer is 79 years. While many people consider themselves lucky enough to live past 80, researchers believe that it isn't quite true; smoking increases the rate of lung cancer at least fourfold, as does poor nutrition and obesity."

How do I tell if I have an antidepressant?

a) It may be difficult to recognize depression because it seems like you are still having fun but the symptoms aren't really there anymore. Try to pay attention to how your moods feel and what activities seem enjoyable. If you are feeling down or sad about something and don't want to get up to go get more food or exercise, try talking to someone to make sure they're okay. Do not give yourself any medications without first speaking with your doctor. Your doctor can help determine whether you need medical assistance. If you suspect you have an antidepressant problem, ask your doctor for advice about whether you should take it. He or she will probably recommend a different type of medication.


Can I change my mind about taking an antidepressant?

a) It depends on what kind of depression you have. Some people never recover completely, while others seem to recover fairly quickly from their initial symptoms. You might not even realize you've started out depressed until you start looking at your life differently. For example, some people who used to be unhappy would become happier once they began to look at themselves in a new light and begin taking action on the positive things that were important to them. Or maybe you suddenly find yourself feeling better once you stop making excuses for why you cannot function properly or why things feel wrong, or even just noticing that you are more comfortable around others now that you know that things will work out. It takes time to let go of negative thoughts and emotions that were","a person who is highly emotional and prone to extremes of behavior, from extreme narcissism to extreme egotism.

BPD does not have any clear cause-and-effect relationship with the severity of depression or suicidal ideation. It can be used as an indicator of whether someone might eventually become depressed after treatment. There are also people without BPD who do have depressive episodes that resolve in time (or even get better).

People suffering from BPD may experience a wide range of emotions, including anger, fear, sadness, confusion, guilt, shame, regret, anger at others for harming them, anxiety, panic attacks, sexual arousal, craving for attention, and obsessive compulsive tendencies. They often experience significant difficulties coping with interpersonal relationships, especially when there is conflict between their needs and needs of those around them. They may feel extremely uncomfortable with intimacy and may find it difficult to engage in healthy sex lives.

There are several other characteristics of BPD that make it particularly challenging to treat. These include:

People diagnosed with BPD often develop an intense sense of ""neediness"" toward close family members and friends. For example, they frequently seek out care when their loved ones begin experiencing problems such as substance abuse or health issues such as depression. Sometimes, they will take on this role themselves to help a friend deal with the same situation.

In addition, BPD patients may use relationships with family members and close friends to avoid confronting their feelings about their moods or behaviors. This self-defeating behavior has been known to interfere with treatment by making treatment more difficult and even causing some individuals to drop out.

The way a person interacts with others depends greatly upon their level of neediness for attention, acceptance, love, or friendship. Individuals with BPD tend to feel a strong need to belong to groups. Groups like sports teams, social clubs, religious organizations, or ethnic communities serve as a form of identity and community within which people can share personal thoughts and experiences. People with BPD tend to have difficulty forming new friendships that don't involve the group of close friends or family members that they had before diagnosis.

Many types of BPD affect different areas of life, so treating all types requires specialized treatment. To determine if you're likely to develop BPD, look into your history and current stressors. Are you being treated for your symptoms? If not, then ask about possible triggers for the development of BPD. Ask if anyone else has experienced similar challenges in their lives. Are","borderline personality disorder, but not necessarily a specific type of the disorder. A DSM-IV diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder does not preclude that there may be other conditions which are also associated with this disorder. For example, some people who have an Axis I (personality) impairment and a social phobia may also exhibit Borderline Personality Disorder symptoms.

Example(s): A patient with BPD is diagnosed as having obsessive compulsive disorder if he has a history of repetitively checking things that don't belong to him such as his socks or shoes while in the shower, often without any purpose, and doesn't feel anything when he finds them. He would be classified as a borderline for such behavior. However, his family members say he exhibits normal behavior during the day while at home; therefore, they believe his illness will subside over time. In a later examination, however, they learn from their son's occupational therapist that he had been experiencing obsessions about being told that he ""didn't deserve"" to wear his favorite hat because it wasn't one of his own design. They then find out that when they were younger, he was constantly telling stories about how he didn't get enough attention from girls and how he felt bad after all the compliments he got. This made him a loner and an observer and did not fit into their children's worlds at all; hence, he is seen by his parents as more isolated than he actually is.

BPD is usually characterized by one of three types of episodes. These may include, but aren't limited to, the following:

Intrusive thoughts (including, but not limited to, intrusive thoughts of death, suicide, hurting oneself or others)

Avoidant behaviors (such as avoiding situations involving potential conflict and social contact)

Problems with relationships (such as feeling ignored, rejected, blamed, and/or unloved)

The most important part of diagnosing Borderline Personality Disorder is getting a thorough assessment of your emotional state, including whether you've experienced these changes:

Emotional instability – either high or low levels of tension and stress

Lack of confidence

Tension between yourself and others (especially in romantic relationships)

Feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness

Anger and aggression

Confusion, difficulty organizing memories, and difficulties understanding language

Disorganized thinking

Poor judgment, impulsive behavior, impulsivity, and failure to follow through on plans or commitments

Abuse","The DSM-5 is not the only source of information about this. I know a lot of people have been in therapy for it and that there are many ways to deal with it, but some people do find relief in meditating or using some combination of meditation and yoga or exercise.

Q: Do you think it's important to be able to differentiate between a person with BPD from someone who just has depression?

It's always good to distinguish between those who have different types of mental illness. And as the DSM-5 was drafted, they didn't include any questions about mood disorders (depression and bipolar disorder) because these were thought to be separate conditions. But there are still people out there who struggle with them. A lot of them don't even realize they're suffering from either type of mental illness! If we can help them figure out which category is most appropriate, that will definitely go a long way toward helping them cope with their condition.

Thanks again to the therapists at Stray Dog Wellness who helped us through our difficult times. We appreciate your support, and we look forward to hearing what you have to say next.","Yes, most of them can be managed by appropriate psychotherapy. Q: how often do they occur? A: very rarely and less frequently than in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder

When Does It Occur?

How often does it happen? That's the question. Usually it happens once a month to 2-3 times per year for the first couple years (this is called 'overlap'), then more frequent during adolescence (up to every 3 months). For example, if you have paranoid thought that someone is following you or has followed you before, that will definitely trigger your paranoid thought episodes. They may start as soon as you see someone, but there are some exceptions. This might help you understand what's happening.

The Symptoms

PTSD is usually seen in teenagers, so this is an important part of understanding why teenagers suffer from it. You may notice that their behaviour seems odd at first. The problem is that a lot of these kids were treated like crazy people who just didn't know any better; as if they couldn't distinguish right from wrong. But over time, the diagnosis becomes clear. If you read about it on the internet, you'll find that many of them experienced hallucinations, delusions and depersonalisation – all of which contribute to your paranoia feeling increasingly real. You're not thinking clearly anymore, and you're doubting everything. Your sense of reality feels distorted, so you tend to exaggerate things. There are lots of other symptoms too, such as: being able to remember nothing for hours, remembering things without looking at them, having trouble focusing on long conversations, imagining that the world around you is moving, being unable to concentrate on anything for an extended period, and difficulty making decisions. In fact, in research studies it was found that adolescents with PTSD report much greater emotional distress after each episode of psychosis, and that they are twice as likely to experience suicidal thoughts. What's more, depression is one of the main risk factors for suicide in adults.

What Can Be Done About It?

If you think you've been affected, talk to your GP/psychiatrist and get a complete medical history. These are probably the easiest ways to figure out if something is going on. If you suspect there's a link, make sure you speak to somebody as soon as possible. Otherwise you're just wasting your mental health service's resources on something that won't actually solve anything. Get advice from a counsellor, psychologist or psychiatrist, especially if you're worried about","BPD is a common mental illness, it's not the only one. I'm just saying that people with BPD are more likely to have a history of abuse than other people, and therefore more likely to show signs of depression/anxiety symptoms. There isn't really any solid evidence for this theory though.

1 2 Next All","I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. It's a bit of a broad diagnosis that has no specific criteria, and some people think it's just about lying or being manipulative or having a lot of anger issues. In reality, it's more like having many different types of problems; I'm not sure which is the most accurate label.

Q: do you have any thoughts on what to do if you're considering suicide?

I don't know that there are anything wrong with asking for help when you feel suicidal. Sometimes the only thing you can really do is try to find a way out of your situation, but this often means taking some time off work, possibly staying at home until you get better, going to therapy, or getting professional help. But if you're feeling suicidal in general, please talk to someone about it—the best thing would be to seek professional help. You might also consider talking to someone who knows someone who may be able to offer support. The sooner you get help, the less likely it is that you'll make a bad decision after coming forward.

Q: how long does it take before you start to feel better?

Depression usually takes a few weeks to a month to show up on your physical appearance. After you've had depression for a while, your skin tends to look duller, you will lose interest in activities that used to excite you, you will become irritable, you may stop wanting things as much, and you may become very emotional. This can lead to people judging you harshly if they discover that you haven't been sleeping well lately. This can happen even though you're still relatively happy and functioning normally. If you find yourself suddenly becoming anxious, worried, or upset, check back frequently because these signs may indicate that something has gone terribly wrong. This could include the sudden death of a close friend or family member, an argument with your partner, a sudden financial loss, or other unexpected situations. There are ways to deal with these feelings—try to focus on positive events rather than negative ones, exercise regularly, and see a doctor. Your mental health treatment options will vary depending on what kind of medication you're prescribed, but you should avoid using any alcohol or drugs that might worsen your depressive symptoms. Talk to your doctor about whether you need psychiatric evaluation for anxiety disorders, mood disorders, bipolar disorders (manic-depressive episodes), or substance use disorders.","Yes, but not always. You may have problems with your mood and emotions at times. You are likely to show signs of anxiety or depression as well as a range of other symptoms that might include feelings of worthlessness, worry, anger, irritability, or suicidality. If you don't see any of these symptoms, it's possible you do not have BPD. However, it is also very important that you seek help immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms: feeling angry, anxious, or depressed

BHMT, a dietary supplement of B-vitamins and minerals such as calcium, manganese, potassium, magnesium, vitamin A and E, can increase serum bile acids, which may increase the risk for prostate cancer. These results were recently published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention. (1)

The researchers studied 14,000 men from two large U.S. studies who had been followed for more than 20 years to look at whether taking these supplements increased the risk for prostate cancer. Among those who took them regularly, 9% developed early prostate cancer compared with 3.2% among those who didn't take them. Compared with those who did not take the supplements, those who took them about once per month had twice the odds for developing prostate cancer.

However, in this study, these people were mostly white or Asian men so there was no significant difference between other racial groups when it came to prostate cancer. So if you're concerned about your intake of phytoestrogens like BHMT, the best thing to do is not to add to your daily dose of vitamins C and D. Instead, try using them in moderation. This is especially true if you don't consume dairy products, since they contain lignans and have been linked to higher risks of prostate cancer in animal studies. Some research suggests that eating foods high in plant-based proteins might reduce the formation of certain prostatic carcinogens. For example, whole grains, beans and legumes seem to help prevent this type of cancer.

Prostate cancer has become a growing epidemic in America. If you're worried about getting prostate cancer, talk to your doctor before starting any new supplements or taking supplements that raise blood levels of estrogens. It's also important to monitor how much you eat each day, since some foods are known to raise breast cancer risk, including soybeans and red meat.","outcomes of selected studies, including whether the men who had these cancers died of them. Answer: no answer >10 years (but see below) >1-5 years Yes No No results from a trial of low dose estrogen treatment in men with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer <10 years of age: The study has not been published yet but it is reported to have shown a statistically significant reduction in prostate cancer death rate (RR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.63-0.82). After 10-15 years of follow up: there was still no increase in prostate cancer mortality with long term use of low dose estrogen (the RR was 1.07; 95% CI 0.86-1.28), and this effect was reversed when women stopped taking estrogen. At 20+ years of age, the overall risk reduction was not significantly different between women receiving long term hormone therapy and those that did not. It does appear as though long term use might be associated with an increased risk of dying of some types of prostate cancer, although this remains unproven at this time.

There were a few deaths due to heart failure and liver diseases, however. This information is included in the paper by Beral et al (2000). There are several articles about potential benefits of long term hormonal replacement therapy. A number of trials looked specifically at breast cancer patients and found that the benefit appears to wane over time. While some researchers suggest that long-term hormonal therapy can help prevent breast cancer recurrence, most do not recommend it for this reason. Another major","the prostate is a gland, and in men that produce hormones. Q: How can I reduce my risk of dying from prostate cancer? A: The most effective way to lower your risk of dying from prostate cancer is by having regular sexual intercourse (and not just anal sex) with an active male partner who has not yet had prostate surgery, a procedure known as castration. This will also help prevent prostate cancer from growing back if you are already infected or have one, or if you've been diagnosed with it. Q: What's the best type of pill to take for preventing breast cancer? A: While there is no single hormone pill that all women should use, many studies show that taking a combination pill containing estrogen plus progestin increases their chances of developing breast cancer compared to taking only one pill. When starting treatment, choose the one which seems most likely to work best. It may be possible to combine pills containing different hormones together if both are thought to be equally effective. However, combining these two pills does mean you'll get less benefit than if you were given the full range of hormones separately. Q: Do condoms protect against sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS? A: Most studies do not support this claim and suggest that condoms offer little protection against STDs. There are no official guidelines on how often people should use them and how frequently they must be used to guarantee complete protection. If someone has a low-risk sexual behaviour, like unprotected oral sex or risky vaginal sex, then using a condom might make them more vulnerable to infection. These precautions include always wearing a condom while changing clothes at home, washing your hands thoroughly before touching other body parts, and checking out any areas where you suspect someone may have recently passed away, especially those that smell particularly foul. Q: How can I tell whether my hairline or neck is getting thicker? A: Hairline and neck hair is usually thicker when it grows longer; however, it may appear thinner when it gets shorter. Generally speaking, it appears thicker during early puberty (when breasts tend to become bigger), but it tends to disappear over time until it starts to grow again after puberty ends. Skin around the area where your hairline or neck meets your head is usually thicker, but it may also start to thin as it matures into adulthood. Q: Can I still get pregnant from my periods if I'm using birth control?

A: Yes, you can still get pregnant if you use contraception regularly - for example, with combined hormonal contraceptives (including intrauterine devices).","outcome is a primary endpoint, ie it doesn't have to be clear that this has gone on for 5 years or longer. In the absence of evidence of progression in the setting where there is no disease stage \/ (eg if a man does not develop a clinical stage IIa prostate cancer but only shows an early-stage one and then dies from it) then they will say ""no progress."" But you're right that ""it's about time we had a more comprehensive approach"" when that comes. What I'm trying to get at here is just what kind of data we want. If we need 100 cases with no progression for every case with >4% progression, are we going to make it so that all the new prostate cancers that come out every year are going to show up? Are we going to do that? My opinion would be no, because those new cancers don't come back after 6 years so we know how many we've gotten. In fact, those new cancers actually go away in 20% of them (and some of them stay around). We don't really care. So what we want is the best available information that can tell us, yes, this patient did have a very high risk, yes, he did have a borderline risk, but in addition, we also need to know what his baseline risk was; what were the previous stages of the disease and how did that compare to the current ones? The reason why I think we may have missed this opportunity is that we don't really understand the biology of advanced prostate cancer -- we've got good ideas about that, but there are still questions like ""how much cell death did the tumor undergo before it metastasized?"" ""did it grow for months before getting into the blood stream?"" ""was there a local immune response?"" etc., etc. The basic idea seems to be that there aren't any really solid answers. There are good reasons to believe that the number of cancers we're finding in men who have been diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer may be even higher than that. Because we have no idea how many cancers we're seeing, we must therefore use our best guess as to what proportion of these cases represent true disease. This means that if we find 80 cases of advanced prostate cancer and 10 of those have metastatic disease, we'll say something like this: 70 cases of advanced prostate cancer and 10 with metastasis

60 cases of advanced prostate cancer and 3 with no progression

Results: The median survival was 22 months (95% CI, 12-43) among patients who received chemotherapy and/or radiation for stage 1 or 2 lung cancer compared with those treated with placebo (P =.004). A total of 37% of patients who were in the control group had a complete response to therapy; only 8% of those receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation for stage 3 or greater lung cancer achieved a partial response and 5% of those treated with placebo achieved an overall response. Among patients in the treatment group who died before 6 years of followup, 27% achieved complete response; 14% of those treated with chemotherapy and/or radiation and 19% of those treated with placebo achieved an overall response. In multivariate analyses, age, race/ethnicity, grade of disease, type of cancer (stage 2 or 3), gender, histologic subtype, baseline characteristics of patients, duration of hospitalization, dose at which drug was given, and time since initial diagnosis did not significantly affect outcome. There was no difference between the groups on the other variables included in the analysis.

Conclusions: Stage IV pulmonary adenocarcinoma is one of the most aggressive types of lung cancer and requires intensive care.

The total mortality was significantly reduced by 16% and 9%, respectively, for patients treated with pemetrexed at the first clinic visit than those who received it later. In comparison, the difference between treatment groups at one year postoperatively was not statistically significant (hazard ratio 0.77; 95% CI 0.73–0.83), but it was significant for the differences over the follow-up period as well, such that the total number of deaths decreased by 11% (95% CI 2.1%–13.2%) among patients who were given pemetrexed at the initial clinic visit, 13% (95% CI 3.6%–18.3%), 18% (95% CI 7.5%–26.9%) among those treated at the second clinic visit, and 14% (95% CI 6.4%–24.7%) among those treated at the third or fourth clinic visit. There was no statistical difference in the total mortality rate between patients randomized to pemetrexed at the first clinic visit and those assigned later. It is noteworthy that these results are obtained by using a highly optimized model, which includes information about tumor location, grade, stage, tumor characteristics, and other variables related to disease progression that may have changed over time. However, the most important factor affecting the survival rates of patients receiving pemetrexed during the study period was the fact that the use of this therapy did not result in any clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life for all patients. A more detailed description of the treatment effects will be presented in detail in a subsequent publication.

Results: In the study population, 87% were free from disease at 30 days, and 94% were free from disease at 60 days. The median time to progression was 2 years (interquartile range [IQR], 1-3) for patients treated with methotrexate plus natalizumab, but 5 years (IQR, 3-7) for patients treated with methotrexate alone or natalizumab alone. Mean interim analyses showed a significant difference in median age at first diagnosis (P <.001), time to relapse (P =.007), and time to death (P =.002). Median followup for patients treated with methotrexate alone was 20.0 years, whereas that for those treated with methotrexate plus natalizumab was 17.6 years (P =.01). Median time to progression was significantly longer among patients who received natalizumab (13.9 vs 10.8 years; P =.02). Among patients who died of nonmelanoma skin cancers, the median time to progression increased by 13.4 years (95% CI, 9.1-16.5) with natalizumab versus 5.2 years (95% CI, 3.9-10.4) with placebo (P =.03). Compared with patients treated with methotrexate alone, patients treated with natalizumab had a higher incidence of malignancies that progressed during the study period (12/44 [17%] vs 6/28 [11%; 95% CI, 3%-15%); P =.003). However, compared with patients who received no therapy, there was no increase in the risk of malignancy progression with natalizumab treatment.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16235522?dopt=AbstractPlus 23% more prostate cancers than men who have not smoked tobacco and 11% more prostate cancers compared to nonsmokers, according to new findings from the largest ever population-based study on this topic.

Prostate Cancer - The link between smoking and prostate cancer may be overstated by researchers at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. Smoking has become the most important risk factor for cancer of the prostate in recent years (1). A report published May 25 in the American Journal of Epidemiology indicates that smoking is the leading cause of death among men under 65 years of age worldwide, accounting for about 17 percent of all deaths (2). It's estimated that approximately 10 million Americans will die from prostate cancer before they reach retirement age (3), while almost 5 million will develop it before their 60th birthday (4).


The study found that although current rates of smoking are declining across the United States, men still tend to smoke more cigarettes per day than women do (5) which suggests that men in other countries may be taking up the habit early as well. According to the World Lung Foundation, there were 8.8 million cases of cancer attributable to smoking in 2004 (6). The U.S. ranks fifth globally for male smokers and ninth for female smokers (7). The problem with this disparity is that U.S. males also consume higher levels of carcinogens than their peers in many other countries. In addition to the harmful effects of secondhand smoke, smokers often inhale pollutants such as benzene and formaldehyde (8).

Men who smoke and have low levels of physical activity are at greater risk for developing prostate cancer (9). Men aged 50-64 with high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol or a history of cardiovascular disease are at increased risk for developing prostate cancer (10). These conditions increase a man's lifetime exposure to dangerous chemicals called free radicals (11). Free radical formation occurs when substances or organs breakdown, releasing free radicals that can damage cells, DNA, and RNA. However, certain types of radiation, like X rays and gamma rays, can kill cancer cells without damaging healthy tissue. Another type of radiation called beta ray radiation is toxic only if the beta ray source is used near an area where the person is","all patients were treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The following cancers (except squamous cell carcinoma) were evaluated in each patient: non-small cell lung cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkins' lymphoma, mixed histologically with other tumors, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, liver, renal pelvis/kidney, bladder, cervix, peritoneum, oesophagus, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, rectum, vagina, vulva, testis, uterus. Bilateral neoplasms included polyps, sarcoma, leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and glioblastomas. Results of the study showed that all patients who received a high dose of radiation had a longer survival than those who did not receive such treatment. There was no difference between treatment groups in the relative risk of death for any particular phase of malignancy or tumor type. However, there was an increased overall mortality from all malignancies measured by the OR (RR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.07–1.47).

A small trial to determine whether low doses of ionizing radiation administered intradermally, over a period of time, are associated with delayed-onset and long-term outcomes after head and neck cancer has been conducted in Europe and North America.8 The results of this randomized clinical trial have been reported recently in the International Journal of Cancer.9 Two hundred ninety-one adults (aged 55 years or older) diagnosed with cervical cancer, diagnosed between July 1996 and June 1998 at six European centers were recruited and enrolled into the study. All subjects underwent irradiation at a site chosen randomly from three sites within the same population. Patients were then followed up for 8 years. A total of 110 patients had complete followup, and 20 had incomplete followup. In comparison with healthy controls, the incidence rate of end points after radiation therapy was 5.3 per 100 person-years, including 3 deaths. Median radiation exposure was 60 mSv/year (range: 24.0–300 mSv/year), with higher average doses being associated with lower rates of mortality. No evidence of excess morbidity or mortality was observed. This is similar to results obtained for studies conducted in Japan and the United States.10

Stage 4 : Colorectal cancer \r

Surgical options for advanced stages of lung cancers include surgery and radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is often used if there is no cure or remission. Surgery is also available if the patient has a very high risk of relapse. In addition to these treatments, chemotherapy can be an option in most cases. Chemotherapy treatment may be given at any time during cancer treatment. Although chemo is considered safe, it should only be given for patients who have a good prognosis and minimal toxicity. There may be complications associated with chemo treatment; this includes bleeding, gastrointestinal problems, bone marrow failure, and death. If you think your loved one may require chemo, you should discuss the best way to proceed with the consultation with their health care team.

Other Options Treatment options for early stage lung cancer include surgery and radiation therapy. Radiation therapy usually means receiving chemotherapy. This is done either in combination with standard radiotherapy, or alone. You will receive both types of treatment together. A large number of people do not respond well to standard treatment because of side effects such as nausea and vomiting. So some patients receive a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The choice is entirely up to you. However, if chemotherapy isn't an option for your loved one, then they need additional treatment. Some treatments are contraindicated in certain situations, so a physical exam and an evaluation by a physician are recommended before the treatment starts. These examinations involve checking the lungs and blood flow.

What Is Cancer?

What Are Lung Diseases?

Lung diseases include many different conditions including respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine, and neurological disorders. Most lung disease occurs in people with tobacco use, but some conditions occur in people without tobacco smoking. When someone smokes, he or she can become ill from inhaling smoke particles, which could cause inflammation or damage to the lining of the lungs. Other causes for lung disease include things like obesity and diabetes, infections, allergies, viral illnesses, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of a low dose (0.02–1 ng/ml) of parenteral chemotherapy in patients with breast-cancer that has metastasized outside of the breast or whose tumor has not been surgically removed. The trial will be conducted at our center from June 2012 to May 2014.

Methods

Patients and procedure

Inclusion criteria were patients who presented with a primary diagnosis of localized or distant breast cancer; had received surgery within 1 year prior to enrollment in the study, but did not have removal of their breast; underwent no radiation therapy or chemotherapy within one year prior to enrollment in the study, although this was defined as no more than 3 years before enrolment; and had an overall survival time of less than 7 months. Patients also required evidence of a positive family history of breast cancer, either direct blood test results or histological confirmation of estrogen receptor-positive disease. All other eligibility criteria were met by all subjects. Eligibility requirements did not include any form of hormone replacement therapy, which has been shown to affect the outcome of women undergoing hormonal therapies for breast cancer.

After receiving informed consent, all eligible participants gave written informed consent about the procedures described below. In addition, each subject provided a saliva sample for analysis.

Study design and baseline characteristics

Subjects received 2 treatments: a lower dose of parenteral chemotherapy (20–50 mg/m3) and an upper dose of parenteral chemo (100–500 mg/m3). Both drugs are administered in a double-blind fashion under standardized conditions. Subjects underwent evaluation and treatment protocols for up to three weeks following receipt of the first dose. During this period, the investigator assessed the patient's response to treatment and evaluated for adverse events. Subjects were followed up until all data were available (median follow-up, 9 days). Patients were considered cured if they completed at least 28 consecutive days without nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, breast enlargement, breast pain or change in appearance. If subjects experienced nausea or vomiting after treatment, these were treated promptly with intravenous fluids and antiemetic medications.

During the course of the treatment period, subjects attended weekly assessments with the investigator. At the end of the treatment phase, each patient was allowed to return home. To ensure compliance with the study protocol, all patients were encouraged to maintain a","yes\r

There are no studies that have found a correlation between the use of tamoxifen and increased risk of triple negative breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Therefore, it is not clear whether these drugs increase or decrease the risk of triple negative breast cancer; this information has to be considered when evaluating the safety and effectiveness of tamoxifen.

The most common side effects associated with tamoxifen are fatigue and nausea. These effects may occur at any time during your tamoxifen treatment but usually begin within two weeks after starting treatment. It is important to know if you experience any of the following symptoms while taking tamoxifen or other estrogen-containing medicines:

Headache or migraine headaches

Fatigue or weakness

Cough

Nausea

Vomiting

Itchy or painful eyes

Shortness of breath

Anxiety or depression

These symptoms may also occur along with some other symptoms such as breast tenderness. You should talk to your healthcare provider about how to treat the symptoms. If you do experience side effects while on tamoxifen, your healthcare provider may prescribe additional medication for these symptoms.

In addition, there are many medical conditions associated with breast cancer, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery. These diseases can cause serious side effects and may lead to death. Even if you take tamoxifen, however, you need to consult your doctor before beginning any major procedures, especially when you're pregnant or plan to become pregnant.

Your health care team will work together with you to determine the best course of action for you. Your healthcare providers may recommend certain types of chemotherapy treatments that are less likely to result in long term harm to your body. If you've already had chemotherapy or radiotherapy and are concerned about your condition, discuss it with your primary care physician so they can help make an informed decision regarding which treatment option might be right for you.","No, but patients may need to be monitored for complications or have a biopsy or transurethral resection\nB: Yes, but some patients require additional surgery at that point and/or can only return home after a few months of radiation therapy\nC: Depends on the patient\r

What is radiation? \r

Radiation is an external (electromagnetic) force applied to the body in order to change one chemical state (a radioactive substance) into another. It does not harm the body. However, there are a variety of things that occur when radiation damages DNA, and these effects can cause certain cancers to develop. Radiation causes various types of changes to cells in your body through different routes, including from nuclear power plants, medical devices, chemicals used in diagnostic procedures, and sunlight exposure. As well as causing damage to DNA, radiation can also affect your immune system. When this occurs, some people will become more susceptible to other kinds of disease such as diabetes. While there are no known health risks associated with radiation, there are still factors that you should consider when deciding whether to expose yourself to it. For example, if you already have a high risk of developing a particular type of cancer because of previous exposure to radiation, you may want to think twice about exposing yourself to more radiation. This depends on what kind of cancer you're interested in having treated, how much time has passed since your last radiation treatment, and any risks that might arise. There's an array of different ways you can get rid of radiation that doesn't actually do anything harmful to you (for example, by using radio-frequency radiation), so you'll need to look carefully at each option before making your choice. See Cancer Treatment Guide \r

B: clinical trials have shown that this may be beneficial in improving survival and reducing the risk for other cancers, but it has not been proven effective in preventing recurrence or metastasis after treatment.

C: there are some anecdotal reports suggesting a reduction in the incidence of skin cancer as a side effect from these therapies. However, the effectiveness of any one therapy needs to be confirmed by randomized controlled trial (RCT) before it can be recommended as safe and effective in patients with breast cancer.

D: chemotherapy has long been considered the most powerful treatment for most cancers, with rates of overall mortality falling within an acceptable range. However, evidence suggests that the combination of chemotherapeutic agents used for different types of cancer could produce clinically significant differences in outcomes and should be explored further.

E: there is no evidence that treating high grade glioblastoma cell line with a pemetrexed/pembrolizumab combination therapy will improve quality of life in patients who are taking regular doses of radiotherapy or bone marrow transplantation. However, it might reduce their chances of developing secondary malignancy, such as lung cancer, bowel cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer or melanoma.

F: patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma, which does not respond well to standard surgery, or whose disease progresses too quickly to benefit from conventional treatment options, should consider receiving either pemetrexed/pembrolizumab combined therapy or radiotherapy.

G: pemetrexed/pembrolizumab treatment can increase the risk of certain complications of radiation therapy, including death, and is therefore not recommended for all patients.

H: patients on pemetrexed/pembrolizumab therapy have reported increased discomfort, nausea, vomiting and blood loss during treatment, and this phenomenon persists despite complete elimination of drug. These side effects appear to resolve over time without causing serious harm.

I: pemetrexed/pembrolizumab is associated with potential problems at higher doses or when given soon after treatment has begun. If you experience any adverse effects, report them immediately to your doctor.

J: there is limited evidence to suggest that chemotherapy drugs are helpful for lowering the risks of myelosuppression, although they can be useful in controlling symptoms and in helping improve quality of life. For people with chronic","stage 5.

In summary, the results from this study show that women are more likely to develop advanced disease in a breast cancer diagnosis if they have undergone surgery for a second time. The incidence of advanced breast cancer is increased when women undergo a first stage procedure within 3 years after diagnosis, and it is higher among those who had two previous surgeries. However, there was no significant difference between the risk of developing advanced disease in the first or second surgical procedures. In conclusion, we found an association between the use of transabdominal ultrasound and increased risk of early-stage breast cancer during follow-up and that any further surgical intervention could not significantly reduce the risk.","I don't know how to answer that.

A: I don't know if you've tried it but that might be what the problem is. It could be caused from your back. You're stretching the muscle or maybe the pill really hurts that area (chin). The pill may also not work well because of the fact that the pill doesn't contain enough estrogen. If you do find a good pill for your situation, I would try taking it with some alcohol.

A: Anywhere from 1-2 hours out of the day for at least a week on end. There is no point in complaining or doing anything else about it because it's not that bad! I can't tell you how many times people ask me if it hurts at all, and I tell them they are crazy! The only thing that really makes it worse is when it's cold outside (if you live in an area with severe winter weather) and your neck starts feeling heavy and cramps up under your chin (this happens if you have an overactive thyroid). When that happens, you can sleep all night until you feel better, and then wake up with a headache. That's the worst part! If you don't take care of your neck, you're going to get hurt again later. Q: How do i know if my neck pain is coming from my head, back, or both? A: They sound different... some more common than others, depending on where you live.

How To Deal With Neck Pain - Symptoms/Diagnosis Q: Hey there, my neck isn't hurting anymore. What's wrong? What should I do? A: As long as it feels good, it doesn't mean you aren't having neck pains. It could be something very minor and easily fixable (like getting enough sleep). Also, sometimes you might think that the problem is being caused by something inside your body (such as some cancer), but if you keep taking care of your body, the pain will usually go away. Here are a few things to try: 1. Doze off 2. Eat less 3. Take a hot bath 4. Get into a comfortable position 5. Use ice or warm water 6. Try using compression bands 7. Ask someone (someone with experience!) to help you massage the area, although it would likely give you a much better chance of relief. Q: what does ""neck pain"" even mean? A: According to the dictionary, neck pain means discomfort. Most of the time, it's from squeezing your neck when sleeping, so make sure you relax before bed. If you have chronic neck pain, you may need to see a doctor. Q: Why am I experiencing neck pain after sleeping? A: You may not think it's due to anything inside your body, but remember that any place where your muscles attach","\nThat's a good one \w+: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0ZgB3_4d1M

\nYou have to move your head very fast. It looks like you're trying hard but it's just not working! Try moving your jaw! \hint: look at that face, don't touch any part of it

\nYou can also try rolling on the floor with your hands and legs to stretch them out in different directions!

\nThere are some things I would do differently though if this was my first time doing these :

\nDoing them standing up seems to make me do better

\nI'm worried about neck cramps so I'd suggest you stand with your arms relaxed (not bent) and start your breathing.

\nThis is the same for any kind of posture! When we hold our bodies straight, that causes tension at the base of our spine, which then puts pressure on the vertebrae inside them. We tend to keep our heads bent when we sit and bend forward when we lie down. This causes more stress on the back of our necks than if we held ourselves straight. Therefore, lying down makes it harder for us to relax into our positions and we end up keeping our heads bent longer than normal. It might be good to practice using only a little bit of your lower body and letting all that tension go through your legs. Then, by relaxing your hips, torso, shoulders and back, you will find you can maintain the position without much effort. The problem comes when we bend over or stand up to pose. There's no way to bring the whole body together while sitting down. So, if you want to stay in a neutral position as long as possible, don't think that bending forward in a sitting position is necessarily bad. A lot of people get hurt when they bend over while sitting and this should never be done. Just imagine having your head on a pillow. You can always roll your back if needed. \hint: looking straight ahead is almost impossible! Try to look slightly sideways. You can use your finger tips to gently pull on the sides of the bed while laying down. If you have to raise your butt up above the seat, remember to let that movement of your hips go. \hint: keep the belly button raised as high as you can before lowering it again. To find the lowest point of your belly, you will","nope. i've never had anything that bad, but i don't know what else to say. if you don't have any problems with your chest and/or spine, then the Pillow Neck Pain is not a problem for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I get my hands on one?\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e

Post 28 I am 5'3"" tall, 180 pounds, and have neck problems which have been bothering me since I was little. My doctor suggested to take a prescription from a medical book and I went ahead and did that, and got myself a few pills. When I woke up, the doctor told me that I need to see an orthopedic surgeon. He said he would call me within 24 hours. It turned out that he had called the doctor a couple days earlier and asked him about the pills I took (which were probably just for anxiety), but it turns out that these pills caused my chest wall to tighten up causing swelling, and because of that, the doctor is now saying it was time to get me tested for STDs. Is anyone else having this problem?

\r

-push in from all sides on one side \r

\r

-let your pillow hang for about 2 minutes and then let it come out\r

\r

\r

-keep going until you get to the point where your back feels completely relaxed\r

There are many other factors that can cause this as well, such as lack of sleep or poor sleeping habits.

Q: how do i know if my neck pain is from my pillow? A: The most common source for neck pain is an old neck injury. This means that when you were injured and it was repaired, your muscle has become weakened because it wasn't used to its full potential. For example, imagine trying to lift weights with only one arm and then having your shoulder dislocate because of the weakness in your muscles. This will likely lead to some strain on your neck. When this happens, it's very possible that the tension may be causing your symptoms. However, there aren't any specific treatments that help with this situation. Some medications may work at reducing inflammation or tension on the nerves that connect your neck to your brain, but these drugs often don't last very long. Many people also experience more severe problems after they have a major surgery like an operation or spinal cord repair. Other medications tend to cause more side effects than those listed above. In addition to medication, physical therapy and exercise can also help ease stiffness and reduce pain associated with neck pain. You should discuss any concerns about your neck and other physical conditions with your doctor. Q: how do I find a therapist who understands this type of neck pain? A: Ask them what their top three questions would be in regards to neck pain. It will probably sound similar to a medical questionnaire, but it's important to remember that a lot of therapists won't even consider treating neck pain until something really bad or life-threatening occurs. These questions can give you a good idea as to whether or not the individual thinks neck pain might be related to an underlying condition, and it'll be easier for you to get a better understanding of his or her preferences. Q: do you need a referral? A: Yes. Most pain treatment centers require a referral from a physician or licensed psychologist. While we all want to treat anyone who needs our services, we'd prefer to spend time talking to someone whose professional background is in neck pain (e.g., chiropractors, massage therapists, osteopaths), and who isn't too busy trying to cure your headache or back ache. To make sure the person feels comfortable being referred to you, ask him or her questions regarding your neck pain and make sure that he or she knows that you're willing to listen","back problems\r

F: An injury to the nerves F.1. A physical object is damaged so much that it no longer allows movement and cannot be used; for example, bones are broken; or the nerve fibers become blocked so much that there is little sensation.

F.2. It also means that the problem is not caused by any other cause. This may occur if your symptoms are due to something else, such as dehydration or stress. F.3. Examples of neuropathy include:

fibromyalgia

Rheumatoid arthritis F.4. Symptoms usually improve with rest and medication. However, some patients still experience difficulties moving their arms or legs, and others experience difficulty swallowing.

G: Difficulty breathing G.1. If your symptoms get worse after taking certain medications or while sleeping, they're probably due to high levels of carbon dioxide (or carbon monoxide). Carbon dioxide causes brain cells to die. When this happens, your body breaks down oxygen into carbon dioxide, which then enters the bloodstream and stays there for about three hours. This process can cause breathing problems such as shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, chest discomfort, and coughing. Signs and symptoms of carbon dioxide poisoning are similar to those associated with high blood pressure, heart attacks, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and aging. G.2. Carbon monoxide can come from the exhaust systems of cars and trucks. Even when you don't know where your car's tailpipe is located, take note of its odometer reading. If your car has one, try looking in the trunk. If it's hard to find out what gas is being burned, call the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration at 1-800-424-8309. G.3. If you have trouble breathing even though you've had your normal dose of medicine, see your doctor immediately. He'll make sure that you're getting enough air through your lungs and working properly. G.4. If you feel dizzy or lightheaded, call 911, but do not rush to the hospital. Call 9-1-1 right away.","the pain caused by chronic inflammation of the muscles or joints in one's hands, feet, and legs; also called: sciatica A: a condition in which the nerves that carry signals between nerves in the lower body to the spinal cord are damaged.

Numbness in hand

The most common cause of numbness in your hand is injury that causes a narrowing of the arteries supplying nerves in the back of your hand to your brain. This results from swelling in an area of the artery that carries blood to the inner part of the hand. If this enlargement does not heal properly, the narrowing can become too tight to allow blood to flow freely from the arm to the brain. When this happens, you will experience a feeling of weakness as well as numbness in your hand. This type of numbness is known as:

anterolateral wrist, finger Numbness A: a form of pain that develops when there is compression of a radial nerve causing a small portion of nerve fibres to be compressed; for example, when someone gets his thumb caught between two bars while he leans over to pick something up, causing him to feel pain or discomfort in his wrist. B: a form of pain where there is normal nerve conduction (no sensation), but there is loss of sensation either in the affected side of the wrist (radial Numbness B) or in the area above the wrist (tendinitis). C: a similar phenomenon, except that the pain is felt only on the non-affected side of the wrist (dorsal Numbness C). D: a similar phenomenon, except that the pain is felt only on the non-affected side of the wrist (mild medial/lateral Numbness D); the symptoms include lightheadedness or tingling (or both); and can last anywhere from 3 days to weeks.

123,Q: hypothyroidism symptoms\nA:,"not sure of the cause.

Hypothyroidism is a medical condition that affects the thyroid gland. The pituitary gland produces hormones necessary for regulating your metabolism, including T4 (thyroxine), which is the primary hormone required by the thyroid to maintain an adequate amount of thyroid hormones in your body. In some cases, it also helps regulate blood pressure and regulates your heart rate, as well as help regulate your brain activity. If you're diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease or any other autoimmune diseases, your doctor may suggest testing to check for abnormal levels of thyroid hormone (T3). This test will look at the size of your glands, your hair color, your nails, and the type of tissue in your stomach or intestines. It may also show if there are areas around your eyes, mouth, and throat where there are tumors or cysts growing. This can indicate cancer.

Symptoms include:","Thyroid disease/nB: hyperthyroidism or hypermetabolism (hyperinsulinemia) C: vitamin D deficiency, folic acid toxicity, and/or low iodine levels

A: thyroid cancer/nA: not in the past 12 months

C: liver problems, and/or abnormal lipid metabolism/nB: obesity and/or insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes A: heart attack/nC: myocardial infarction and/or stroke B: kidney failure and/or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis

B: low iron stores, a variety of bleeding disorders, and/or iron deficiency anemia A: severe bleeding disorder, including hemorrhage from a cutaneous mass that is larger than 5 cm, or from an open wound that is smaller than 1.5 cm; and

N: no medical history, acute or chronic, of any of these conditions: diabetes mellitus, hemophilia, lupus erythematosus, hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, renal insufficiency, pulmonary fibrosis, or other diseases affecting blood flow and function such as cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia; and

N: no family history of any of these conditions; and

G: pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding;

The patient must receive periodic evaluation and treatment to prevent recurrence of autoimmune thyroiditis. The physician should determine if the patient has other risk factors for autoimmune thyroiditis based on evidence of clinical findings and laboratory values, with an emphasis on clinical manifestations of infection. For example, the presence of unexplained weight loss may indicate that a subclinical condition called postpartum thyroiditis exists and can be diagnosed using serology and/or ultrasound imaging. Other possible risk factors include chronic use of medications, alcohol abuse, and drug allergies. If the patient is under medical supervision during follow-up visits, he or she will need to adhere to a strict diet and exercise program.

Treatment for Hypothyroidism

1. Early detection. Patients who are at high risk for developing autoimmune thyroiditis should have their clinical signs and symptoms evaluated early. These patients should undergo diagnostic imaging studies, especially MRI, to assess the extent of autoimmune thyroiditis. Imaging studies can help distinguish between primary and secondary cases.

2. Antibiotics and iodine therapy. Infants","Thyroid hormone (T4) is produced by the thyroids in your brain and thyroid glands, and it helps regulate body temperature. However, you may also have a low T3 (t 3 ) or high T4 (t 4 ). The low T3 level can cause symptoms of hypothyroidism such as lack of energy, fatigue and weight gain. High levels of both thyroid hormones can cause an increased risk for depression and other mental health problems. Hypothyroidism often causes symptoms similar to those experienced when you are under stress, so you should talk with a doctor about ways to cope with anxiety and depression during this time. Your thyroid's function affects how well your immune system works and what happens in the brain during sleep and dreaming. If you don't take thyroid medication or follow certain healthy lifestyle habits, you could be at greater risk of developing disorders that affect your mood and cognitive abilities such as: Anxiety

Depression

Sleep disturbances

Insomnia

Dizziness

Memory loss

Changes in appetite

Muscle cramps

Weight changes

Gastrointestinal disturbances

Inability to concentrate and focus

Slowed growth

Low libido Low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, especially in women, can also lead to sexual dysfunction. When TSH levels fall below normal, sex may not occur as easily as usual. It's important to note that many people who suffer from severe hypothyroidism don't experience any kind of sexual dysfunction. Some research has suggested that men may experience more discomfort when trying to achieve orgasm while taking thyroid hormone replacement medications. Women may have fewer orgasms than men because their bodies produce less TSH. While there isn't enough evidence yet to say if these findings apply to all patients, many people believe they do. This doesn't mean that all hypothyroid individuals will develop erectile dysfunction. What does matter is whether these hormonal changes improve your sex life. Many studies suggest that hypothyroidism treatment may help reduce sexual problems due to poor blood flow in the genitals, like having a hard time reaching climax or being able to enjoy pleasurable acts with partners. If you're concerned that you might be experiencing sexual difficulties because of hypothyroidism, check out our Sexual Problems section. For information on thyroid medications, see ""Taking Care of Yourself"" below.

Treatment options If you're diagnosed with hypothyroidism, you'll likely need to see a specialist to determine the best course of action","no, not to worry. You'll be fine with the following treatments: 1) Iodine 1/4-1/2 teaspoon orally every 4 hours or as needed 2) Thyroxine 3-5 mg once daily or as needed 3) Calcium Thrombolysis (CTLA-4) 4) Chloramphenicol 5) Vitamin D3 6) Athletic Diuretics 7) Pregabalin 8) Metoclopramide 9) Antibiotics 10) Tylenol 11) Niacinamide 12) Other medications may be prescribed for a given patient, but none of these will cure hypothyroidism.

What is hypocalcemia?

Hypocalcemia occurs when a person's body temperature falls below 97 degrees F (37 C). When this happens, blood flow into the brain stops and can cause damage. If someone has hypocalcemia, they may have seizures, coma, or even death. Most people don't get hypocalcemia. However, some people do. These individuals are called hyperthermic patients and many hospitals treat them on an emergency basis. Hypophosphatemic patients usually become severely ill within 24-48 hours of having their blood sugar lowered by medication, which often includes sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), potassium bicarbonate (potassium carbonate), calcium chloride (table salt), and magnesium bicarbonate (sodium carbonate). Because most people who develop hypoalgesia recover completely, it's important that doctors take seriously any signs of illness. The signs of hypophosphatemia include: Difficulty breathing

Nausea

Weakness

Dizziness

Irregular heartbeats

Confusion

Inability to speak

Difficulty concentrating

Slurred speech

Blindness

Seizures Some of these signs and symptoms last for several days, so if you notice any of these signs while being treated in a hospital, call your doctor right away. Sometimes, however, they disappear after treatment is finished. Although hypophosphatemic patients generally recover fully without further help from medical personnel, other patients may require additional medical care later on in the same day because of dehydration. This may also lead to complications during the recovery period, such as hypothermia or infection. Your doctor can assess your condition and prescribe appropriate treatment if necessary.

Will my thyroid test result change after I start taking","hypothyroidism does not cause thyroid disease in adults.

Hypothyroidism is the most common medical condition in children, and it may be a problem for you as well. It's also more prevalent than commonly thought. Many parents believe that their child will never develop an autoimmune response to certain foods or medications because they have no other underlying conditions, but this is not true. The truth is that while there are many genetic variants linked with hypothyroidism, a person can inherit only one of them. But, if both genes are present, the patient may be at risk for developing thyroid dysfunction. An autosomal dominant (A-D) form of hypothyroidism, called hypo-T3(+) deficiency, affects approximately 3% of all people who are born. People with hypo-T3(+) deficiency often go on to develop a second type of hypothyroidism called hyperthyroidism due to mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor gene (Thy2). Thyroid cancer occurs most frequently in patients with hypo-T3(+) deficiency. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, depression, decreased appetite, weight loss, dry skin, hair loss, weight gain, muscle weakness, increased sensitivity to cold and heat, acne, constipation, headaches and night sweats. While most people with hypothyroidism do not get serious complications from their disorder, some people do. Some doctors recommend waiting until age 40 to start treatment with thyroid medication or surgery; others say that a person can safely begin taking the medicine by 45. If your child develops any signs of thyroid problems, talk to your doctor about starting treatment right away. This article provides information about what thyroid medicines your child may need and when he should begin or stop treatment.

How is hypothyroidism diagnosed?

Doctors use various tests to diagnose thyroid problems, including blood tests for thyrotropin (TSH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH 2 ), thyroid antibodies (Thi), thyroid hormones (TCO4, TSH, TRH, T3, free T3) and thyroid stimulating agent (TSG) levels. Thyroid function test results can help doctors figure out whether the thyroid gland has been damaged. These tests may tell doctors if your child could benefit from surgery to remove the thyroid gland. Children who are treated before they reach puberty can have normal TSH and TSH 2 levels even though the thyroid gland is still producing TSH. Your doctor might also want to examine your child's bones and","I'm not sure if that's a problem or an issue.

2) Is there any way to prevent my symptoms? A: Yes, you can use vitamin E supplements for long term protection! Vitamin E is found in most foods so try eating some raw fruit or vegetables along with your other food sources to get enough of it to help reduce the risk of developing hypothyroidism later on. The only thing I would recommend doing is avoiding alcohol and caffeine as well. If you are worried about your weight, I also suggest trying the Thyroid Solution diet as well (or you can just cut out all fat).

Hematologic Reactions

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility

Pregnancy

Postpartum patients should be counseled to avoid excessive consumption of alcohol, particularly in early pregnancy. Alcohol can cause hyperthyroidism and result in hypothyroidism. If these conditions occur together, the risk of fetal harm increases substantially. If there is a history of hyperthyroidism in the mother, an adjustment of dosage to prevent potential fetal harm may be necessary.

The use of estrogen replacement therapy after delivery may increase the likelihood of thyroid problems in children born to women taking such drugs.

Prolonged use of hormonal contraceptives may lead to an increase in the risk of postpartum thyroid disorders. Hormone replacement therapy is not recommended if this has been indicated for any reason by a physician.

Breastfeeding

The frequency of adverse reactions to breastfeeding is unknown; however, it appears that adverse effects on infant growth are likely to be similar to those seen in neonates after birth. Because most cases of hyperthyroidism involve maternal overnutrition, breastfeeding cannot be considered a safe alternative to medical treatment. In addition, women who breastfeed may have difficulty controlling their own weight. Breastfed babies are at greater risk of developing hyperthyroidism because they do not receive as much calcium from their mother's diet. Although it is unknown whether the development of","hypothyroidism symptoms.

- Q: I have high levels of thyroid hormone and was taking anti-thyroid medication. What are the consequences? A: The anti-thyroid drug may cause more problems than it solves. If you take an anti-thyroid drug to reduce your thyroid gland, you will likely be experiencing low T3 (triglyceride) and low T4 (sugar). High T3 is not good for anything but weight loss. Low T4 is bad for muscle mass, bone growth, hair, nails, etc. The only way to decrease the levels of these hormones is with a healthy diet. Your body can't make them so they must come from somewhere else in your life, which means that what you eat and drink determines how much of the right kind of hormones are released into your blood. You could also try taking thyroid supplements, or even eating enough thyroid food to maintain normal thyroid function. It's important to note that TSH and free T3 both drop when your thyroid gland goes dormant. This happens most often during pregnancy. Some women can go months without having their TSH drop because they don't really notice it and it just disappears along with the rest of their body. In other words, this is one reason why women may experience some estrogen effects when using birth control pills.

- Q: Is there a difference between TSH and T 4? A: There is no difference between both hormones. They all work on the same mechanism. These days there are many different types of thyroid hormones available. Since many doctors do not know what ""normal"" amounts are needed by their patients, some physicians now recommend you look at your serum TSH level first before doing any thyroid hormone supplementation. So if you're looking to see whether you need to increase your dosage, ask your doctor about what his/her normal range would be. A few years ago, we did a study on over 400 men. We found that men who had higher than normal TSH had a lower risk of prostate cancer. Our data shows that even though our body makes different amounts of each hormone, and even though we produce less of each of these hormones than people without thyroid disease, we still have the ability to improve our health and increase our chances of surviving cancer. It's also possible that if a man has low levels of a particular hormone he may live longer because of the increased production of certain enzymes. So it's best to talk with your physician if you want to determine your own personal optimal level of these","the only symptom of thyroxine deficiency is a severe, usually persistent headache. However, in most cases it will go away on its own, and you do not need to take any other medications or supplements.

How common is hypothyroidism?

The prevalence of thyroid disease varies greatly by age group. The following chart shows that thyroid dysfunction affects an average of 17% of children over the age of 5 years. In addition, a substantial proportion of infants (4%) suffer from hypothyroidism as well. There are also many individuals with autoimmune disorders who develop hypothyroidism. Although there have been studies showing that thyroid abnormalities may be present in up to 70% of patients diagnosed with Hashimoto's, this does not mean that all people with hypothyroidism will experience hypothyroidism.

Are there different forms of hypothyroidism?

Hypothyroidism can result from either type I or type II deficiency. Type I hypothyroidism typically manifests itself with mild to moderate, localized pituitary gland enlargement, resulting in an underactive pituitary. This condition is known as primary hypothyroidism. It is sometimes referred to as ""juvenile"" hypothyroidism. Primary hypothyroidism may be accompanied by other neurological manifestations, including cognitive impairment and motor impairments. Most often the symptoms are transient. However, at times they can become chronic. Type II hypothyroidism results when there is an excess of iodide in the blood. This condition is called hyperthyroidism. When these conditions occur together, we call them mixed primary and secondary hypothyroidism.


There are several factors which increase the likelihood of developing primary hypothyroidism, such as: having a family history of primary hypothyroidism; being young; a family member who has had thyroid cancer or a"

Birth Control Use During the Pregnancy Cycle

Fetal and Child Development

Numerous studies have shown that the risk of adverse effects on human development is greatest in women who delay starting or stopping their period during pregnancy. In an earlier study, approximately 5% to 8% of all pregnancies were terminated because of maternal abnormalities (e.g., pre-eclampsia), 4% to 6% due to preeclampsia, and 2.5% due to other conditions (1). Although this finding may not be surprising, it has also been reported that the incidence of a number of birth defects is lower among pregnant women with irregular menses than among those who do not experience irregular periods. Some of these birth defects include mental retardation, cleft lip/palate, heart defect, and craniofacial anomalies such as anencephaly and spina bifida. The most widely studied and documented risks of pregnancy associated with delayed menses during pregnancy are fetal growth restriction and decreased birth weight (2,3,4). For example, in one study, the average duration of postpartum abstinence from oral contraceptives was 3 years, whereas in another the average length of abstention was 7 years (5). One recent review found that in the United States, about 1% of pregnancies occur before 37 completed weeks of gestation (6). Therefore, although pregnancy can still result in adverse outcomes, there are more than enough reasons to postpone or stop taking oral contraceptives if you decide to become pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant. If you are planning to get pregnant soon after your last period, discuss your intentions with your health care provider.

Pediatric Adverse Reactions Associated With Oral Contraceptives

In pediatric patients, the long term effects of hormonal contraception depend greatly upon whether a child takes the pill at the same time each month and how well she manages her symptoms (7,8). These children often develop severe acne with or without seborrheic dermatitis, which leads to painful peeling of the skin; they may also develop hair loss, resulting in permanent baldness. They also have higher rates of breast and uterine cancer compared with nonusers and their mothers. Furthermore, if they take the pill continuously during their adolescent years, there is a greater likelihood that they will need surgery (9). Because there have been no reports of serious side effects in pediatric patients using oral contraceptives, the potential harm is small when compared with the long","no.

Pregnancy Test - Pregnancy test (H&E) can be used to determine if you are pregnant, but it is not considered a reliable pregnancy test. This test does not use antibodies against the fetus. To use a pregnancy test, you must have your menstrual cycle and the sperm in your semen tested with an assay that is appropriate for your particular situation. The following pregnancy tests work well: FSH \/ \/ + Estradiol \/ + TPO; LH \/ \/ \/ TPO \/ + mIU/ml; FSH \/ \/ \/ Estradiol \/ \/ \/ TPO; IUI \/ \/ \/ Estradiol \/ \/ \/ TPO;

If you do get pregnant using this method, and after two cycles of use, you feel the need for another one, you should start with a low dose of estrogen plus progestin (usually 10 mg every other day), followed by a higher dose of estradiol plus progesterone (4-8 pills per day). If you stop taking these medications, or if they become ineffective because you cannot tolerate them, then take the lowest effective dose until you find another way to prevent conception. Some women experience difficulty stopping birth control pills from working at all. As a result, some doctors recommend starting a new contraceptive regimen before having sex. In addition, many people who want to become pregnant may not be able to conceive unless they start using oral contraceptives immediately after their last period. When taking a combined oral contraceptive pill such as ethinyloestradiol and norethindrone acetate, do not take more than 3 days between periods. You will increase your risk of unplanned pregnancies. Use an additional form of contraception until you can safely use the combined oral contraceptive pill again without any side effects.","<1 follicle per mm3> Pregnant women who are not using contraception should be advised to take oral contraceptive pills and/or a hormonal method of birth control for at least 7 days before their scheduled visit to the clinic. This will help prevent pregnancy, however it is important that the pregnant woman have contact with her healthcare provider after taking these medications. In addition, if symptoms occur, the patient should be observed for signs and symptoms of an adverse reaction such as nausea or vomiting. Patients can receive treatment immediately by obtaining prescription contraceptives from a pharmacy or doctor, or they may choose to postpone any medication use until the following day, preferably on the weekend (e.g., Monday) if they feel better. When the pregnant woman has received the recommended dosage of oral contraceptives in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, she should return to the clinic or health care facility within 3 days after stopping her prescribed dose of contraceptive pills. If a pregnancy occurs before this time, the decision whether to continue to use contraceptive methods must still be made based upon the clinical condition of the female individual and other available evidence regarding efficacy and safety. For patients who do decide to proceed, additional counseling should include information about potential risk factors (such as the patient's previous history of unintended pregnancies).

Clinical trials The Clinical Trials Program of the National Institutes of Health provides funding for research conducted through the NIH-funded Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which conducts a large number of epidemiologic studies to determine the influence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) on sexual behavior, heterosexual relations, and overall health. CDC also funds several other studies aimed at understanding the role that STDs play in sexual behaviors, including sexual activity, HIV infection and prevention, and the effect of sex education programs and abstinence promotion. CDC recommends that STD testing be performed routinely for all persons ages 14 years and older at routine visits to public health clinics, regardless of any prior history of abnormal genital findings or the presence of STDs, regardless of personal beliefs about these issues, and without regard to age group. These recommendations apply both to male and female participants alike, although some exceptions exist for individuals aged 13–17 years, those who were married at any point during life, and children under 18 years of age. The following organizations provide funding for STD surveillance activities related to reproductive health and sexual health among men who have sex with men (MSM): Men Who Have Sex With Men Study, which includes a sample size of 12,000 MSM, and the Human Microbiome Project.

Cases of severe or prolonged pregnancy complications in the first trimester, eclampsia and septicemia occurred more often than expected. The number of cases requiring postnatal care was high at the end of gestation. In addition, the incidence of congenital abnormalities (such as heart defects) was low. This study showed that the incidence of major malformations decreased after discontinuation of hormonal contraception. It also highlighted a strong association between the contraceptive use and the risk for some serious adverse effects, such as an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. These findings are consistent with those obtained from studies done on women who have undergone tubal ligation or other surgical procedures (for example, hysterectomy) before their menstrual period.","\/\/(c)Para-dicine\\r

\","naloxone is not a replacement for regular birth control pills and cannot prevent pregnancy. Naloxone can be used to treat or prevent opioid overdose symptoms in people with an underlying medical condition that may make it hard to get pain medication, including those who are addicted to opioids. You should see your healthcare provider about taking naloxone if you are currently using any form of oral birth control to prevent pregnancy.


BOTTOM LINE: Birth Control Pill (Plan B One-Step) does not protect against HIV infection. The pill works by stopping the virus from replicating. However, because condoms do not stop HIV transmission, they do not work as well to reduce the risk of AIDS infection, so condoms are often removed during sex.

Medical Disclaimer","it is not that simple. In fact, I was told there are no natural cycles so the procedure would have to be done artificially. For example, they could create a small egg or sperm cell and then implant them into the ovaries. But this technique isn't really viable because when you implant an egg in the womb the fertilization is already done before the process of maturation can begin. Therefore it doesn't really work well for those who want to get pregnant naturally.

Q: How many people were involved with the project?

A: It's difficult to say how many people have been involved, but I think we did about 15-20 people at most in total. The most important aspect of the whole project was to study these cells and find out what they do. We wanted to learn everything possible about them.


Q: What were some of the challenges that arose from the discovery?

A: One challenge was understanding where the nucleus comes from. So we had to figure out exactly where the DNA came from and how it got there. Another issue was how much of the gene is necessary for this particular function. Also, if the cell dies, does its genes go with it? So we had to figure out all these things together.

We also discovered two new types of gene - one is called Tlr3 and the other is called Ogr1. And this is a really exciting thing as these are very interesting genes, which means that they may lead to treatments for diseases such as breast cancer. This could potentially help women who might need treatment during pregnancy. But first we must figure out if these gene changes actually cause any problems. Then we will know more about their role on fertility.

Another challenge was making sure that these cell lines were healthy enough so that they wouldn't become infected by bacteria and viruses. There are different kinds of bacteria in every body and they can infect various places including reproductive tissues. This was another major challenge. If our research is successful, we hope that scientists will soon find ways to use these cells to treat genetic disorders.

Finally, we made some mistakes along the way. As a result, we had to make a few modifications to the cells' genome. However, in some cases we managed to improve on what had been previously discovered.

Q: You said you didn't get funding for your work until now. Why so long after the fact?

A: Because I needed to prove that my research was working. My interest in using gene","in the women who are on hormonal contraception, and in those with normal ovaries but no obvious ovarian cysts or a history of tubal pregnancy.

2-4. BISULFATE DIAGNOSIS \/ nB: absence of spermatozoa; infertility; abnormal gonadotrophin levels.

5-7. GONADOTROPHIN LEVELS \/ nA: low; high concentrations indicate elevated testosterone levels.

8-9. PERMANENT OVARIAN SYNDROME \/ nA: loss of serum hormone secretion during menstruation.

10-12. PREDICTION OF THE AGE OF MENopause \/ nIn the late 20th century, many people believed that menopause could last as long as age. However, there has been little scientific evidence to support this notion. This section discusses some of the factors associated with this uncertainty. As mentioned above, studies show that the average life expectancy for women has increased by about 10 years since 1900. Most researchers now believe that this increase is due primarily to improved medical care, and that the longer women live, the more likely they will develop endometriosis.

13-15. PRECIPITATION OF THE FERTILITY SYSTEM \/ nAn overactive, immature ovarian follicle (hypovolemic) indicates decreased production of estrogen and may lead to early ovarian failure. The follicular phase can be shortened if the patient is treated with progestins during their menstrual cycle. If she is not exposed to progesterone, then her total period begins early in her menstrual cycle (after ovulation). In addition, women taking oral contraceptives have had a marked reduction in ovulation, which makes it difficult to predict when the next time period will occur.

16-18. CANCER WARNING SIGNS \/ nAs a result of the introduction of various vaccines into our country in the 20th century, we became aware of several types of cancer that were particularly dangerous to infants born prematurely. For example, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, shingles, hepatitis B virus, and Hepatitis C have all caused serious complications to babies and young children. Although most of these cancers were cured with anticancer drugs such as penicillin and tetracycline, in the case of some of them—such as Hepatitis B—"

As soon as he stood up, he turned around, stared at me for a long while, then walked off without saying anything. That was the only thing that moved me in the room. Q: Did you see him again after that? A: No. But after he left, he came back by himself to talk to us again, but he kept looking straight ahead until we put our hands on him. He asked how things were going before he disappeared again. Q: You told me that he seemed to speak only English. Was that true? A: Well, he said some Japanese words, but he also spoke some Chinese words. Q: What kind of language? A: Basically, Japanese. He asked me what kind of house we lived in, which apartment building, and where we lived, but nothing else, so I thought he was just playing with me. But as soon as we started talking about it again he got really excited, and he said, ""You know, everyone says my hair looks beautiful and I want to dye it! Now I have money!"" I remember telling him it wasn't necessary because our relationship was so good; that all I needed was more time, so he gave it to me. I couldn't believe it. We went out into the courtyard and talked for awhile, then he headed toward the street where he worked and suddenly he called, ""Natsumi! Get ready!""

Eyes and Vision, September 1994

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 1. Some people with normal vision can have a condition called myopia which causes them to see things in sharp focus in dim light. 2. Some people with low vision can also have myopia, but this does not usually cause serious problems. 3. There are several types of myopes; one type is characterized by blurry vision, while others tend to be able to see well at night and out at night. 4. Myopic children who grow up in poverty may experience less severe myopia than other children do. 5. Many people with myopia develop visual disorders later on in life. 6. People who don't see clearly should make sure they have adequate light exposure and that they keep working or studying as much as possible. 7. Myopia-related eye diseases such as glaucoma are generally milder than most forms of blindness. 8. The best treatment for myopia involves regular use of dark glasses. 9. I'll try and explain what myopia really means in layman terms if you want to know more about it. 10. This question is about how to find information about prescription glasses. As far as we've been told, there is no easy way to find information on this subject.

Glasses for Computer Users Summary of Findings A few years ago I came across some interesting news items online. One of them said that glasses were becoming very popular among computer users as it was considered ""easier"" for them to read text on large displays. It was reported that this phenomenon was partly due to improved image quality when compared to computers from 20 years ago (it turned out that the larger display size gave the better picture). Another report stated that some parents of school kids had tried making their children wear glasses so that they could watch videos more easily. However, some parents felt that these glasses did not provide enough protection and that they only increased the number of times their child would stare at a computer screen each day. Although there were no clear answers regarding whether the glasses could actually help to improve reading performance, those looking into the issue found that the glasses had many benefits. The main benefit that I saw in using the glasses was reduced glare. To understand why glare becomes a problem, consider the following analogy.

10. ""sensorimotor therapy"" or ""muscle strengthening"" \r

11. ""flexibility training"" \r

12. If you can't fit any of these into your schedule, use yoga as well! It's great for building flexibility \r

13. If you're having trouble sleeping, try taking some sleep medicine such as Valium, Benadryl or Xanax. It will help you fall asleep easier and get used to the idea of falling asleep right away \r

14. If you want to strengthen your muscles or learn new ones, you'll find that practicing poses and other moves helps. Practice with both hands and see if you feel stronger or lighter after each practice, because it often feels like someone is pulling at a muscle \r

15. If you can't hold a pose you learned from a book, read about it online or watch instructional videos. Also look at books on physical therapy or chiropractic techniques \r

16. If you want to improve your ability to withstand punishment - like fighting for your life - do yoga moves to prepare yourself before","backbends, backbending\r

ND: neck and shoulders stretches (upper body)\r

NP: neck and shoulders stretches (lower body)\r

PS: neck and shoulders stretches (other)\r

RS: neck and shoulders stretches \u2014 This is the stretch that I personally like to use. It gives you a really good feeling when your neck starts to tighten up. I usually do this during my morning commute or in an elevator with no one around me so it does not affect the rest of my day much. The first time it feels quite strange but eventually I get used to it. You can also perform neck stretching during sex as well; just be sure not to take too long doing it!\r

""The muscles are getting tighter and stronger"". That's what I hear all the time from people who claim they're ""too tight"", ""too loose"", or ""just right"". However, if there's any muscle in the whole body that is going into over-drive during a workout session (or even worse during bed), then it should definitely feel tense. And the tension shouldn't stop once the weight has been lifted – unless you have an injury where it may make things uncomfortable for some time afterwards.\r

If you haven't already done so, start off by lying on your stomach with your legs spread apart and your feet together on the floor. Then place both hands under each arm and pull them towards your chest. At the same time, slowly lift your arms up until you're lifting your head above your torso. Do this 10 times or more and you'll see that your upper arm tends to get stiffer while performing the exercise. Keep at it until you achieve a certain level of discomfort. If you're still not satisfied, try lowering your arms further down until you reach the point where the pressure doesn't feel as bad anymore. As soon as you've reached this point, increase the resistance again and repeat.\r

Now you need to go through these exercises 2x per week. One thing about this routine will become clear once you start: I'm using both free weights and dumbbells here. A lot of strength enthusiasts use only dumbbells. So why don't we try using weights instead?

Chest-Neck-Shoulder Exercises With Flexibility

1. Bicep Curls


Begin with the rings on each side of your head. Hold them in place while extending one hand up toward your forehead so the fingers are pointing straight out from the top of the ring. Inhale as you bring your hands together and lift the rings into position. Repeat this exercise three times. Rest for five seconds between sets. When ready to begin another set do 1x5 reps with the same weight for three sets.

2. Neck and Shoulder Rotations

As you sit down take the ring on each side of your head and rotate your neck and shoulders in 90° turns until both hands are fully extended and your body is completely horizontal. Continue with 3 rotations in total. Return to the starting positions with the rings still held in place for 5 seconds before rotating the opposite way. Repeat this routine 10 times. Rest for 20 seconds between sets. When ready to begin another set do 1x20 secs with the same weights for two sets.

3. Overhead Tricep Extensions

Take the rings off of each other and stand with your feet hip width apart. Extend your arms overhead in front of you until they reach parallel. Keeping your elbows close to your sides keep your torso upright. Slowly lower yourself slowly down while keeping the rings at their original height. Once you reach the bottom slowly pull yourself back up over your previous resting position.

back pain\r

Back pain can be caused by many things, such as back surgery or degenerative disc disease. For some people, there are treatment options that can improve their quality of life. These may include physical therapy or medication, depending on your condition. The best way to manage back pain is to make sure you do regular physical activity such as exercise. It will also help relieve stress in your muscles so you feel more comfortable. If this doesn't happen, try a relaxation technique like yoga or tai chi to relieve tension. Your doctor can prescribe medications for certain conditions, but most back problems can be managed without medication if you follow these steps: Tension headaches - relax muscles that control them and keep them from tensing up when stressed. See your doctor if this keeps you from doing daily activities. Back injuries or diseases - have an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan to look at the spine or other parts of your body. Ask about the type of injury. A spinal cord injury often involves damage to the nerves that send messages to your brain. Some doctors think that nerve disorders, such as multiple sclerosis or Lou Gehrig's disease, can lead to spinal fatigue. This may cause you to tire quickly, which can be problematic during long journeys. Injuries from sports - take time off work or school, or rest if necessary, if you're injured because of a sports accident, an accident involving machinery, or a fall.

stress - find ways to reduce or avoid stressful situations in your life. You might try talking with friends and family members, taking a walk around the block, or getting out into nature. Try to get away from your computer and cell phone screens at all times. Sleep deprivation - avoid sleeping too much, especially after a workout. Have a routine of waking up between 8 and 10 am. Get enough sleep to stay alert and relaxed throughout the day. Avoid caffeine at night. Do not drink alcohol before bedtime or during the day. Eat healthy foods. Exercise - for example, walk outside and run around the neighborhood, or go for a bike ride. Take a warm bath or shower before going to sleep. Relaxation techniques - play music or read a book. Use tai chi or yoga, meditation, deep breathing or visualization techniques to release tension in your shoulders, neck, back, stomach, legs and lower abdomen.

131,Q: exercises for better posture\nA:,"yes, but it's not a substitute for exercise! It will just make your back ache more.

(more) Q: If I have to work out everyday and my muscles get sore, how can I still do the exercises? A: The best thing is to keep them in motion and keep working on them every day.

(more) Q: How do you know when you are getting tired? A: When you feel pain or stiffness in your joints. Do you notice that when you're sitting or lying down, your shoulders are taut? And when walking, your knees bend at an angle? Is this because of muscle weakness? Or does it mean there's tightness in your hip flexor? If you find yourself feeling like this after training sessions, then you probably need to add some extra stretching exercises into your routine!

(more) Q: What's the key to having a strong body? A: Strength! We all want a big chest and strong legs but we don't want those things to compromise our health or well-being. We all need strength in different areas so when we start exercising we should target all areas. Here's what makes strength important: 1. Lying Down Exercise: Stand up straight with your back against the wall. Close your eyes, relax and hold for 10 seconds while contracting your abs. You could also press against the wall and try to stretch it out. 2. Walking Exercise: Walk forward along the floor without stopping until you reach the ceiling (don't worry about getting dizzy; your feet should be close to your head). Your heels should hit the floor first as they will help stabilize your weight as you walk forward. 3. Running Exercise: Keep your heel slightly raised and run at the same speed as your running shoes. Use the momentum to push off the ground as fast as possible. 4. Squatting Exercise: Lie on your stomach. Raise one leg higher than the other as far as it can go. Pressing down gently using only your upper body, slowly lower your body down to the ground as if you were resting on a mat. 5. Sit Ups Exercise: Place the palms flat and place your hands together on top of the toes and rest your elbows on the balls of your hands. Hold for 20 seconds before returning to the starting position.","to relieve pain or discomfort, particularly in the upper back.

4 - 5. ""Belly Band"" Exercise (or Routine): This exercise is performed with a belt looped around your waist to keep you from leaning forward while wearing it. It uses a simple set of weighted bands that are wrapped around your torso and held by straps. The band starts at your navel and passes through both breasts, then loops down toward your abdomen and attaches at the bottom on each side. To use this routine for abdominal cramps, do the following: Hold the bands in front of your shoulders as if you were holding them in your hands. Then pull one band through your belly button and over your pubic bone, just behind your navel. Hold the other band in the same place. Repeat this movement four times until you feel an improvement in pain. If you are unable to hold the bars firmly within a certain distance, try using another weight or hold your arms slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. You can also perform the routines this way with dumbbells. Be sure to wear comfortable underwear and remove your shoes before doing this activity.

5 - 6. ""Lunge"": Sit up straight while maintaining your back straight throughout this exercise. Perform one rep of every set. Stand tall so that your heels are facing away from you and slowly bend your knees. Then reverse the direction of the movement and stand upright again. Do three reps of each set, alternating legs. Each time you complete the sequence, gently lower yourself backward towards the floor. This position will help ease any pressure points. Use the bands to strengthen your core muscles while also strengthening your glutes, hamstrings, and calves. For added benefits, perform the lunge two minutes after performing the situp.

6 - 7. ""Squat"": Lie face down with your feet about 15 inches apart on a flat surface such as a hardwood floor. Keeping your legs and hips straight, begin to squat until they touch the ground. Your thighs should be parallel to the floor when your hips reach their full extension. Keep your chest up and breathe deeply into the contraction. Push your elbows out to the sides and push against gravity to stabilize your body. Continue lowering yourself until you stop moving and return to your starting position. Rest 30 seconds between sets.

7 - 8. ""Crunches"": Lie face down on a mat with both hands resting on the mat's edge. Start by keeping your knees together and toes pointed directly at your partner. Slowly","it's a good idea to look at an old poster, or read a book on how to get better posture.

You're going to look better and improve it as soon as possible!\r

\r

Practice is a very important part of the process of improving. You can't force yourself to do any exercise unless you want to fail at something you've tried before. If you don't practice, then you won't be able to progress.\r

\r

If you feel like practicing, try it once or twice but never more than one or two times each day. This way you learn about how much pressure you should put on your joints, muscles and bones, so that the body develops stronger muscle tone and a firmer spine.\r

\r

Try to pick an exercise that's simple enough for people who aren't used to doing this kind of work. It shouldn't require a lot of time to make sure it's good for your back. Take the time to figure out what makes sense for you. Don't just jump into something if you think it sounds easy. Try it first and see what happens! \r

\r

After making sure you enjoy the process and don't lose interest, start training! The only thing you need to know is that you need to keep pushing yourself until your body gets strong enough to stand on its own legs without support. Once it does that, you can take it slowly from there. Once you're able to lift heavy things (like weights), you can start learning basic moves like pushups or pullups. Eventually you might even begin jumping around the gym, trying new things to build strength in your upper-back area. \r

\r

Once you reach a point where your lower back feels comfortable standing on its own, move onto another type of exercise. Start off with squats, which have become popular as a way to increase stability and reduce hip flexor pain. But be careful not to start squatting too far back because that increases the risk of injury. After that, you can try lunges. They may seem complicated, but they really help strengthen your core while increasing flexibility. Next up, deadlifts. Although these are more advanced movements than squats or lunges, they can help you develop all three. You can use different weight plates depending on what size you are. As long as you are using","can you imagine a world without an exercise program? Q: is there any way to find out if the person is going to have good posture or not? A: Yes, one of the first questions you will ask after meeting them is whether they are healthy enough and if they were able to get rid of their bad posture. After that you should also inquire about their health condition with specific reference to the patient's age and sex. (Note: if it does not make sense then just don't ask). Q: I am currently working on improving my posture but I do not know how to go about doing this? How can I get started? A: You can start by visiting a physiotherapist. They will help you get your posture in order so that you become more active. Ask for a referral from a doctor as well. If there isn't a doctor near you then check here. The following list covers some common medical issues that people might encounter. It doesn't cover all possible situations but it might be helpful to know what may happen if you experience these types of problems. Q: What is the most important thing to remember when practicing yoga? A: Be patient. Most of us spend our whole lives being irritated by sitting too much or too little - and we have no idea why. Being patient means taking time each day to practice. Even though you may feel like you are having trouble getting into position, you shouldn't give up completely. Just continue trying until you succeed. Also, try to focus your attention on the physical sensations you are experiencing rather than your mind. We believe that keeping your head still makes you less likely to make mistakes while looking at something else. In fact, the more relaxed you seem the less likely you are to make mistakes. Another way to keep yourself on track is to sit comfortably, hold onto your chair/saddle for support, keep a cool breeze blowing against your back, etc. These simple things can help prevent errors. Q: Does yoga pose really increase blood flow? A: Not necessarily! Studies have shown that different poses such as forward bends, twists, lunges and hip thrusts may actually decrease blood flow to your extremities. Since blood circulates throughout your body we need to maintain proper circulation within our limbs. In other words, we need to avoid being in an awkward position where the skin and muscle tissue are exposed and where we cannot receive adequate oxygen. This involves ensuring that we stand on the ball of our feet, balance ourselves on our toes and keep our legs straight. When you stretch","for the purpose of getting a more open and relaxed neck. E: exercise to increase strength in muscles used in movement, especially the upper back; P: exercise to improve flexibility of joints or ligaments such as the shoulders, elbows, knees, ankles, etc.; S: exercise to get rid of tightness in muscle groups; A: physical activity, also called fitness, which includes athletic and recreational activities; J: exercises designed to strengthen muscles or joints by using weight or resistance and/or other external factors, such as force, angle, or acceleration; V: strength training, also referred to as power lifting, which is an organized form of exercise where the athlete can use weights to work specific body parts.

Note that there are no absolute rules about the best methods to perform these types of movements; however, they have been shown to be safe and effective at improving certain aspects of overall health. For example, many studies suggest that performing squats, lunges, deadlifts, and leg presses may lead to improved cardiovascular conditioning (2), lower blood pressure (3), and a reduced risk of diabetes (4). This is because these specific moves allow a person to increase the range of motion of their entire body through the use of different muscles on both sides of the body. However, this has not been found with all variations of the various lifts in general, so the effectiveness of each variation will vary depending upon how it's performed (5).

To avoid injury, you should always practice your chosen movement only when warmed up first, then gradually progressing to more advanced techniques over time until all potential risks have been taken into consideration. Additionally, the ability to perform various types of movement should be evaluated carefully before beginning any type of workout program. It is important to keep track of progress against yourself and to see if it continues to improve throughout the course of the session. In addition, proper technique must be maintained during each lift or exercise for maximum results. If you start with bad technique while learning new movements, you could easily end up hurting yourself.","the whole body, but especially in the back and shoulders\r

S: you may have heard people say that ""after 5 years of working out I'm ready to quit"" \r

T: you might want to consider getting more exercise at another part of life that doesn't stress the body as much, like gardening, gardening on your own, playing sports, hiking, bird watching, or even just staying active and healthy \r","and more. There are a lot of little things that I'm doing to improve my posture, including some very specific stretches. The first is to make sure the front of your body doesn't arch while sitting, so that it's not as awkward when standing up or walking around. This exercise is going to help strengthen the lower back and prevent any tightness in the hips. It also helps develop good postural alignment. Another one is to sit on an incline bench with your feet about shoulder width apart, then move them apart about half way before lowering yourself down into the bench. You should feel like you're being held by two people who are pushing you. Then try to maintain this position for at least 15 seconds before moving back to the starting position. When it feels easy enough, raise yourself off the ground until you can do 5-10 reps without having pain/stiffness in the knees (you'll probably have to bend over slightly). Finally, there's another thing called the ""pancake"" stretch. Take a couple of towels and stand with your legs straight out in front of you on a flat surface. Place a folded sheet between each leg, just above the knee level. Slowly lower your legs slowly under your own power from the bottom position, keeping the towel pressed against the back of your thighs. Hold for 2 minutes, then repeat twice more. To keep from hurting yourself, don't let go of the towel. Keep your elbows bent and back arched. Do these three stretches twice daily.

The same stretches can be done with a bandana or other firm support if need be. In fact, I sometimes get really sore joints after stretching, but because I've already gotten plenty of use out of the regular stretches, I only take care of the inflammation afterwards. It makes me realize how much work goes into making sure everything looks right after I start my day. And now that I know how to properly stretch, I am always looking for ways to save time and effort later on!

How did you choose which muscles to train? Did you find the ones listed here to be particularly beneficial?

I've found that all muscles tend to benefit from training as long as they're strong enough to resist the tension produced by the movement they're used in. So even though it may seem simple to pick a muscle group and focus on strengthening that muscle group during a workout, that simply won't happen! Some muscles will become stronger while others will weaken due to the strength required of each particular type of contraction.","how to take care of your body, get into a good physical shape.

q: qabr (or karab) is a type of Persian dish from Iran and the Middle East that consists of ground meat cooked in oil, spices, etc. Qatar is one of the most popular dishes in Persia today. It is often served as a main course along with other dishes such as dumplings or rice. You can find some tasty recipes here on this site.

R: Rabi-Rahman (literally ""revelation"" in Arabic), literally ""a revelation"", refers to the prophetic books (the Quran, Hadith, etc.) that come down through Muhammad's lifetime, generally about three centuries after his death. The Qur'an was revealed over seven years (633 Hijri - 527 CE). Many Muslim scholars regard the Qur'anic revelations as eternal and therefore never have any need to be revised and amended by later revelations. However, there are many who believe the Quran cannot be altered at all (see my article ""The Quran is not an infallible book"").


What is Revelation?

Revelation comes in two forms, literal revelation which has been written down in the Quran and also metaphorical revelation which came with Prophet Muhammed (PBUH), i.e., when He received revelation through his companions during His lifetime. Some Muslims consider this process of revelation to be more real than literal revelation because it has always had a spiritual element to it. For example, some say that if Allah sends an angel to tell you to do something that would make you sin, then he will tell you something similar in the hereafter (such as 'I am sending another angel to remind you'). This means the angels are really communicating with us (and sometimes even with God Himself!). Also, some say that God revealed new verses at different times during Muhammad's life, as well as in different circumstances. Thus, Muhammad (PBUH) may have had several revelations, but he did not receive them all at once (there could have been several revelations from God during Muhammad's lifetime before anyone ever read a single word of the Quran). All these explanations are considered part of the concept of the ""revelation.""

Q: What exactly does the Qur'an reveal regarding the time and place where the coming judgment occurs? A: It explains what happens in that moment and includes rules of conduct and guidelines for prayer and fasting that should be followed. In addition, the Bible"

You could probably tell if I was allergic or not though... the rash on my face looks kinda weird though :P. [quote=headpats][quote=phantom]your reaction is pretty much exactly what i'd expect from an allergic response to something so common in humans[/quote]


but if they actually do feel it? well, it's a good thing they don't have any contact with your body yet anyway!


theyre very thin and look sorta like tiny needles through the skin but i dont know what kind of triggers them because i didn't touch any of them while doing research.[/quote]


there are things that trigger them like some kinds of chemicals, but i didnt know that until recently.. also like certain foodstuffs which can be harmful to us and also certain kinds of drugs for example.


I would recommend that if you were to get one of these types of reactions that you wash off the product as soon as possible afterwards. It seems that if someone has a cold or flu and then gets a bad reaction they may spread it around to others who weren't exposed to anything else before the start of their illness.


and if there's no way for them to get rid of it quickly due to being so small, then maybe the most important thing you should do is stop using all products containing hairspray!


it will almost certainly kill off the bacteria by causing inflammation and ultimately making the hair dry out faster than normal!


[quote=jimmykitty]this might be annoying but i think im going to go get another tarantula.[/quote]


theres nothing wrong with having one however if you want to keep it safe i suggest getting a different species since this spider has become immune to most of the ones i've tried already so it shouldn't pose much danger to people.


just make sure to take care of it properly whenever you come into contact with it so that if you ever end up","the head is a great place to start \nAw, you look so good!\r
