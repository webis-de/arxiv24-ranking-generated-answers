1,Question: What are the most common chronic diseases? What effects do chronic diseases have for the society and the individual?\nAnswer:,"Chronic illnesses such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes are among the main causes of disability in a country.

What is also considered to be an epidemic is obesity, which has become one of the most recognized diseases that affects all ages and sexes across the world. Obesity is often thought to be caused by lack of exercise or inadequate diet, but it could be due to several factors, including genetic predisposition. Obesity can cause many health problems that affect the cardiovascular system, immune function and bone loss (osteoporosis). Obesity can also contribute to other serious medical conditions, like hypertension, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney disease, cancer, arthritis, nerve damage, respiratory disease, and depression.\r


While there are certain general trends for the incidence of chronic diseases, they vary from region to region and time to time. For example, in 2000-2001, 1.1 percent of all people aged 20 years and older had any chronic illness. However, in 2010-2011, this number rose to more than three times the rate in 1999-2000. The rise in rates may stem from changing patterns of aging, as the elderly population will increase until 2050 and then drop after that. There is no clear evidence of trends over time as some countries may not report data on their statistics for many reasons, such as being unable to collect data on non-communicable diseases because of privacy concerns or limitations on what information can be collected.\r

How is chronic disease treatment determined?

There are various ways to diagnose and treat chronic diseases. First, doctors use tests to examine the patient's body to determine if he or she is sick. Some tests require specialized equipment. If a doctor feels that the symptoms indicate a problem with the entire body, he or she may prescribe a drug. Drugs usually work best when used for longer periods of time (for instance, six weeks at a time) before a person becomes ill again. Doctors often recommend various medications for different types of illnesses. When a medication fails to work well enough for a particular condition or problem, another prescription might be needed. Although doctors sometimes find that a combination of drugs works better than one medication alone, these drugs have long side effects and can pose serious risks to the patient's health. Physicians also use alternative medicines to address specific needs; alternative medicine involves using herbal remedies, homeopathic remedies, natural products such as vitamins and herbs, and even supplements. These alternatives must follow FDA regulations governing safety. Another way to treat chronic illnesses is through physical therapy.","The primary causes of disease in people are genetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle. There is no single cause of all diseases. Each person's genetic makeup creates specific risk factors that increase their risk.

One of the key characteristics of chronic conditions is that they persist for a long time after symptoms appear. When you read about a new syndrome such as Alzheimer's Disease or multiple sclerosis, it can be hard to accept that something has gone wrong with your body so quickly. That's why I want you to think critically before you start thinking, ""I'm going crazy."" You're not crazy. Even if your doctor says you've got the flu, don't panic—the virus will pass through and make its way into other parts of your body and eventually affect brain cells and even kill them!\nSome diseases, like diabetes, aren't reversible once you get sick and there isn't a cure. Other chronic illnesses, like cancer, can have serious complications if left untreated. But what if we could reduce the amount of suffering caused by these debilitating disorders? A new generation of drugs could help us prevent many of these conditions from becoming permanent. So what makes an illness a chronic one? It's the same thing as an old-fashioned disease: If it doesn't go away on its own, then it is a chronic condition.\nWhen you think of an illness, think of it in terms of how often it occurs over time. Chronic conditions arise when certain tissues begin to change, which damages healthy tissue and may lead to physical damage. For example, some cancers develop when there is inflammation (or angiogenesis) of healthy blood vessels. Acute infections may trigger chronic disease in the respiratory tract, and some autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis may result from changes in immune system function. People who are at high risk for developing chronic diseases are those who: smoke cigarettes; are overweight or obese; have heart or kidney problems; suffer from hypertension or uncontrolled diabetes; use alcohol; take medications that alter hormones; have a family history of cancer or AIDS; or have been diagnosed with major depression or bipolar disorder. \nIf you fall into any of these categories, consider getting screened for these conditions and see a physician immediately if you notice any signs or symptoms of chronic pain, joint pain, muscle aches, mental confusion, loss of appetite, headaches, fatigue, joint swelling, night sweats, or unexplained weight gain. In fact, you might feel better if you took a few steps back and looked carefully at your health status to see","The diseases that cause many deaths are heart disease, cancer, diabetes mellitus, asthma, arthritis, depression, and hypertension. These illnesses are often caused by a failure of the body to cope with the stress of life or a lack of adequate protection against these diseases (such as nutrition). However, some other chronic diseases, such as stroke, kidney disease, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis, may also be responsible for death.\r

What causes certain chronic diseases? If you can answer this question then your risk of dying from any illness is very low. You should see an expert if you want to know more about what causes them. But, it is not necessary to worry too much about it because a simple diet will prevent most chronic illnesses. \r

Many people are concerned with health problems in their family members but the reality is that they are not really sick themselves; they were just affected by the situation of those around them. For example, it might occur that one member of your family was suffering from diarrhea at some time. It is unlikely that he would become ill himself unless you suddenly put him on a fast, for instance, but his family has been complaining bitterly and you made them feel so bad that they went to bed hungry. And when they wake up the next morning and find their children all crying out for food, they cannot imagine how you could possibly have done that! So, the symptoms are probably nothing to get upset about, except that they might make you think twice before eating something else. When you are concerned about a health problem in someone in your own family, ask yourself whether you might be able to help your loved one. Some possible options include: • Paying attention to the condition of your spouse or partner. If she is experiencing difficulties while you work, it might be worth paying attention to her and trying to help her improve. Some good sources of information are available through medical associations, local newspapers, magazines, and Web sites. This information should help you evaluate the seriousness of her problem or even suggest ways that she might better manage it. In addition, if you can't pay close attention to someone else in your family, try paying more attention to yourself. This usually means having a regular checkup, going to the doctor regularly, and avoiding smoking and alcohol. Even though these activities won't always solve all your health problems, doing them every day can make a big difference.

• Changing your eating habits. Eating healthfully can reduce your chances of developing","Chronic disease is a set of problems that affect one or more parts of the body. These problems can include, but are not limited to, heart disease, cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, musculoskeletal conditions such as back pain and joint pains, and mental illnesses like depression and anxiety.\n

In addition to these disorders there are many other serious health problems in which people suffer. We all experience some stress during our lives. Stress causes damage within the body and throughout the nervous system. It also affects your moods, memory, and behaviour. Stress has been shown to be associated with higher rates of heart attack and certain cancers. More than 85% of patients who seek medical attention for stress-related symptoms had experienced at least 1 episode of acute illness before seeking help from their doctors. Stress also increases your risk of falling.\n

The main cause of chronic disease is lifestyle factors. Many people think they have no need to worry about it because, after all, they get enough rest and exercise. However, if you take into account the fact that most people spend an average of 7 hours per day at work, walking up to 30 minutes per day on average, and that it takes you two months to recover from an injury, then you will understand why so much effort goes into managing chronic conditions. As well as having a physical condition, the person must often deal with psychological issues too. Unfortunately many people don't realise how important stress really is to them. To quote the late Professor Sir James Dyson ""Most people live in fear of what they cannot control"". This explains why we fail to improve the quality of life for individuals living with chronic conditions.

When did our modern world begin? Where did our ancestors originate from? How was civilisation established? Where does today's world start? Is civilization inevitable? Did early humans develop technology (e.g., stone tools), or were primitive cultures already around when agriculture began? How long ago was the first human settlement discovered? Who created agriculture? What happened to agriculture once it became industrialized? Was agriculture responsible for the increase in human population? Why did agriculture spread worldwide? How did farming communities adapt to changing climatic conditions? How did culture change through time?

Culture and Society

There are many ways of thinking about culture. Cultural evolution refers to the gradual process by which cultural traits become inherited from parents to children. The term 'culture' may refer to a social group or a specific","Chronic diseases cause considerable suffering in the form of a loss of productivity and social well-being. This is due to the reduction of human potential, both physical and mental. It also leads to long term health problems such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes etc. The impact of chronic diseases on the economy and society was discussed extensively by Professor Viscount Haldane at the Institute of Economics of University College London (IECL) during a lecture entitled 'The Impact of Health on Economic Growth' held on 16th November 2010.\r

""The economic costs that result from sickness or injury can be very high indeed; for example, people who suffer a stroke while driving their car are much more likely than others to lose income over the following year."" \r

Dr Andrew Coyle, IECL, said. He added: ""In England the burden of illness will increase substantially because of ageing populations and increasing use of medications. People living with heart disease and other types of blood disease are likely to feel worse about themselves, and there may be an increased tendency to engage in risky behaviour"".\r

According to Dr Coyle, the UK has lost 1 per cent of its population since 1940, and could see even greater losses if it continues to lose jobs.\r

Vaccination programmes have been effective in reducing the number of cases of vaccine preventable diseases such as measles and mumps in recent years, but they still need to be improved, he explained.\r","Chronic Diseases are those that affect you directly, either physically or mentally. They can be physical illnesses such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes, mental disorders like depression and Alzheimer's disease, as well as social issues such as crime, violence and drug addiction. A medical condition is defined as any of a group of conditions where people experience pain, discomfort or impairment in their daily life, or which require medical treatment in order to maintain health. A condition may also include an illness but not necessarily a disease. The following list describes the main categories of chronic diseases: Heart Disease

Diabetes

High Blood Pressure

Neurodegenerative Diseases (Parkinson's Disease)

Cancer

What is the relationship between medical marijuana and Parkinson's Disease? As previously stated, there is no cure yet for Parkinson's disease. But researchers hope that one day we'll develop drugs that treat this horrible degenerative disease that affects more than 7 million Americans. While the drugs currently being developed don't cause any side effects, the scientists want to see if they could improve symptoms by using cannabis oil or other cannabinoid extracts in patients' medicine cabinets. It would take years and billions of dollars to develop a drug that works on that scale, but even today there are some promising studies taking place in Europe and elsewhere that show promise. \r

How can I protect myself from the dangers of recreational marijuana usage? Marijuana smoking has been linked to a number of harmful health consequences including: heart attack and stroke; lung damage; cancer; psychosis; and impaired driving. Cannabis has shown promise as a safe alternative to tobacco. In fact, several European countries now allow limited production and sale of ""medical marijuana."" If you're concerned about your health, talk to your physician first before trying marijuana for yourself. You might want to consider talking to someone close to you who knows","Chronic disease is one of the most serious threats to our health. The World Health Organization has defined it as the ""chronic, high-level inflammatory disorder of the immune system that produces a wide range of harmful symptoms"" (WHO). It includes such conditions as type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), Crohn's Disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, hepatitis C, asthma, lupus, and cancers. According to Dr. Kripalani, diseases like cancer, heart disease, depression, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other forms of neurodegenerative disorders also contribute to chronic diseases. In fact, more than 30% of all deaths worldwide are attributable to chronic diseases. \r

A major cause of death in developed countries is cardiovascular disease, which can be divided into two main categories: ischemic and non-ischemic. Ischemic heart disease is caused by atherosclerosis and is the leading cause of death globally. Non-ischemic causes include coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, lung cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, and colon cancer. Cancer is one of the top 10 causes of death in developing countries. About 10 million people die annually from cancer worldwide - 2.5 times the number who die from HIV/AIDS. As you may know, AIDS is an opportunistic infection, meaning that the virus can infect healthy individuals and cause them to become infected with HIV or develop AIDS in spite of having no infectious agent. People often think that AIDS does not exist because there are not enough cases reported but this simply isn't true. There are millions of people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide but only about 1000 cases of AIDS are ever discovered each year due to the difficulty and expense involved in testing for HIV. Also, AIDS remains unknown among those who have had positive tests because they have not been tested enough. That means that only 60% of all people diagnosed with HIV are actually infected. A good way to understand how many thousands of people may be suffering from AIDS is to consider the population of France. If you take the total number of French people aged 18 years and older and divide it by the population of France you get 0.03%. However, if you multiply the percentage by the number of new infections each year (approximately 300,000 per year) you get approximately 6,500 people who are affected. Another way to better understand the magnitude of AIDS is to compare it with tuberculosis, another contagious disease. Approximately 4 million people suffer from tuberculosis","There is no one disease that is the only cause of long-term ill health. There are also many other causes, but these are generally not as prevalent or deadly as those mentioned above in this survey. These illnesses include high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's Disease. Some of these conditions can be treated with medication, some may require surgery to relieve symptoms. For example, some people may need surgery because their pancreas does not produce enough insulin or they have a family history of heart disease. Many of these illnesses affect men, women and children equally, and there is usually no reason why it should be different in gender, age or race. In general, however, men tend to have higher rates than women of the following chronic diseases: High Blood Pressure – 65%

Diabetes (type 2) – 50%

Heart Failure – 40%

High Cholesterol – 30%

Parkinson's Disease – 20%

Hypertension – 15%

Coronary Artery Disease – 10%

Osteoporosis – 5%

Chronic Kidney Diseases – 4%

Cancer – 3%

Alzheimer's Disease – 1% While a small percentage of the adult population suffers from all four of these chronic diseases, they are quite rare among children and young adults. The majority of the population has none of them. Many of the chronic diseases affecting this group have been linked to lifestyle choices, such as diet, exercise, smoking and alcohol consumption. This survey was designed to provide an overview on what diseases are most common, while providing more information about how healthy living affects the course of each.","Chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and arthritis all affect society in some way. Diseases also affect individuals by increasing the risk of death or disability. There is growing evidence that many chronic diseases may be treatable at an earlier stage with a simple lifestyle change. In particular, there is strong evidence that people who drink alcohol do not live longer than those who do not drink alcohol; therefore, these factors must be considered when designing public health interventions.\n\nIn order to develop effective prevention strategies, it is important to understand which specific conditions lead to chronic disease and how they can be prevented. The following table summarizes the causes and causes-related effects of each of the leading chronic diseases listed in Table 1 of the WHO Human Health Index (1): \nFigure 2 shows the relative prevalence of different types of chronic diseases across countries (2). A number of global differences are evident, ranging from low prevalence of tuberculosis to high rates of hypertension, obesity, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and various cancers, among others. To explore the relationship between alcohol consumption and certain types of chronic diseases, we use data on lifetime and current alcohol consumption. For example, if someone consumes 10 g/day of ethanol, but has no history of drinking or heavy drinking, their lifetime average alcohol consumption would be <10 g/day, so they will have only minor effect on their risk of developing any chronic disease. Conversely, the same person consuming 30 g/day of ethanol would be at increased risk of having a hip fracture, diabetes mellitus, or other type of chronic disease. The table below details the relative risk (RR) of a given cause of chronic disease in relation to annual average levels of alcohol intake, and includes some additional factors that may contribute to this association.

Comment from a reader: A question about my sleep, am i supposed to eat more?

My answer: yes and no. If you are having difficulty sleeping or if you have trouble waking up after having slept for less than 2 hours, you need to find out what's wrong with your diet. Try eating some vegetables and fruits (not too much) and make sure you get enough protein in it. It helps to use an oatmeal with milk (or fruit juice), and some other things to add flavor, so that you can wake up feeling refreshed instead of tired.","it depends on your lifestyle and how much you exercise. If you have high amounts of physical activity, you should do cardio to burn calories.

Q: Do you drink anything while exercising?A: I don't drink any drinks while doing my exercise program so that I can focus more on the workout instead of drinking alcohol to keep up with my intake. But if I'm in a hurry or need to, I'll take an energy drink like Monster Energy Drink or Red Bull.

Q: Any food allergies? A: Yes, all foods are fine but be sure to check for any specific allergens. For example, bacon is not allowed because of its fat content. Check for other possible allergies before going out for a run.


When it comes to the running, running with a heart rate monitor (HRM) is very helpful when analyzing your runs. It will help determine what your goal pace is and allow you to easily measure your distance as well as your average speed without having to put yourself under a lot of pressure from your HRM.","a. Workout with music and cool things like this one or the video above

b. Yoga (or Tai Chi) or other movements to help you get into a relaxed state of mind for long stretches

c. Run, walk, or bike around your neighborhood or park or on your computer or phone

d. Play a game that lets you control what time it is on your watch, like Pokemon Go

e. Do something that helps you maintain balance when you're working out

f. Sleep in between workouts if that's what works best for you

g. Use a timer app to set up appointments at specific times so you don't have to wait until later that night before getting back to work

h. Take a nap if you feel tired after training, especially if you were doing heavy weights for an extended period

i. If your trainer doesn't make using the Apple Watch easy enough or your body just isn't built for it yet, there are plenty of fitness trackers available for Android. These include Fitbit, Jawbone UP, Polar Motion+, and many others","it's really hard to choose one. I have been using a free app called Zephyr and some other ones for about 5 months now and I like them both (although Zephyr is easier to use). The reason why I love it is that there are so many options, it just takes a couple of clicks to find something you're looking for. But then again, if you want more than those, try this.


The app can be used to track your steps, sleep patterns, calories burned per day, your weight, workout history and more. It even has a calendar feature where you can see how much time you'll spend on various activities throughout the year. There are also features to help you stay motivated. For example, if you think you're going to go a long way on a treadmill before finishing the app, you can set reminders in advance that will automatically remind you when you need to take another step or jog around the block. A useful feature that I appreciate is the ability to get an estimated total distance traveled each day with your steps count. This makes it easier to keep track of time spent at the gym and not miss out on workouts because you weren't paying attention. All the information that the app collects (including steps) is stored locally and only accessible from within the app itself.


Another great feature of the app is the ability to import data from other apps. For instance, I frequently check my weight while biking. To do this, simply log into the app and enter what bike you were riding during the past 24 hours. You can select which day you logged, which type of bike you had and whether you had any hills to add to make up for the added weight.


So how does it compare to other fitness tracking apps? Well, let me tell you what I've done as well. I took advantage of the $5 value offer on BestBikeApps.com to give away 1 month of access to their free mobile application ""Trackr"".

This has been shown in studies where people have eaten carbohydrates up to 500 grams a day over 10 years, however it should always be measured in grams not kilojoules.

If you want me to go into more detail on what we eat and how much, please take time out to browse through the articles listed above so you know all about each of them. Now back to our questions…

Q: My doctor told me that I need to stop smoking at least 10 years before I'll be able to get my cholesterol under control. He said that since I smoke a pack a day, I must have one cigarette every night! What do I tell him? Should I quit? Answer: Smoking cessation is actually incredibly difficult, let alone if you're overweight. If your doctor tells you they cannot make you stop smoking, just ask them why they think you have to. They may say that their patients usually don't like the idea of quitting but, because of their weight, it's too hard to even try. You should also remember that smoking cessation takes months of intensive training, so it's better to do it as soon as possible than to wait until later.

In general it's best to give yourself plenty of time. The sooner you start, the easier it will be. Also, while you may feel like you're giving up at first, I guarantee you'll find that if you continue, then eventually you'll quit completely.

Q: How much salt should I use in my diet? Answer: It depends on whether you prefer foods rich in sodium (such as red meat) or other sources of sodium, such as cheese, pasta etc… When looking at the amount of salt you consume, choose foods high in sodium to keep your blood pressure from going up too quickly.

As an example; 1-2 tbsp per meal or snack (depending on how salty your food is) is good enough for most people. However, if you're trying to lose weight, then you should aim for 3 to 5 tsp daily. A teaspoon contains around 5 mg of sodium. So if you'd like to lose weight you should look for high quality meats and vegetables, low amounts of processed fats, nuts","I have had no clinical events that would indicate a connection between your health and the use of this product. This is why we have not released any clinical data to date. It's still an open question as to whether or not it has an adverse effect on people who are at higher risk.


Q: i am a diabetic\nWhat do you suggest I do? Answer: We recommend that you consult with your doctor first before starting a diabetics diet, or switching to a ketogenic diet, especially if you have high blood glucose levels.","in the short term, diabetes increases your risk of heart attack. The longer you have diabetes, the higher your risks increase. In addition to this, people with diabetes often need to take insulin injections or to be on a daily glucose monitor, which means that they are not able to eat and exercise normally.

Diabetes is also associated with various other health problems, such as high cholesterol, osteoporosis, kidney disease, and cognitive decline (ADHD). When it comes to diabetes, it's important to keep up your weight and make sure you are getting enough calcium and vitamin D. You can find out more about the symptoms of type 1 Diabetes by reading our tips for living with Type 1 Diabetes here.","it depends on a number of factors. The main one is lifestyle and how you are active, but there also have to be other things like diet, exercise, stress... I can't say much about it because we don't know enough about this issue. There's some research that shows the more stress there is in your life, the worse you will get at insulin resistance.

You can read the full answer here","A diet rich in fruits and vegetables may lower your risk of developing diabetes, but not all types of fruit and vegetables are created equal. While the average person needs to consume about 100 grams of protein per day, some people need more than twice that amount. For these individuals, a higher intake of low-fat dairy products or beans will help. Many experts believe that a healthy diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables is important because it can help prevent certain illnesses including heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer, Alzheimer's and arthritis. But not everyone has access to quality, whole foods. Research suggests that poor diets may increase the risk for several diseases, including Type II Diabetes and obesity. It may also be worth considering whether specific dietary patterns should be used to reduce your risk of these conditions.

How Much Should I Eat? The answer depends on how much you already eat and how often you exercise. If you're trying to lose weight, it may make sense to keep things simple by limiting calories from carbohydrates and alcohol, which can raise insulin levels, according to the American Heart Association. The following guidelines suggest an appropriate daily calorie intake of at least 1,500 calories for men (with normal body weights) and 2,000 calories for women (in addition to other recommended amounts).

But I do not think this is a reason to stop eating meat and butter. To me it seems more rational to eat a diet rich in plant foods than a low-fat one. There are many good reasons for vegetarians to include animal products.

Q: can vegetarians be diabetic?

A: No. In fact, some studies suggest that people with type 1 diabetes may have higher risk for obesity because of their lower carbohydrate consumption (6). However, these differences were mostly due to an excess of carbohydrate. People who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet tend to consume less carbohydrates than those on a low-carbohydrate diet, which means they have more energy available for exercise during the day. Thus they tend to lose weight faster compared to people on a typical Western diet (7) – the difference between the two diets was about 25% after eight weeks. That said, if you are trying to keep your weight under control then reducing the amount of protein and fat you consume might reduce your risk for future weight gain. A vegan diet does not seem to have any significant effect on the risk for type 2 diabetes. One study showed that vegetarians had much lower risks of heart disease than did nonvegetarian men (8). Another study found that vegans were less likely to die from cancer than were omnivores (9), although other research has shown mixed results on whether vegans suffer more from cardiovascular diseases than do omnivores (10). Finally, there is a large body of evidence suggesting that vegetarians and vegans should be healthier overall than are nonvegetarians and most of the time they are (11). So even though vegetarians do not appear to be at increased risk for type 2 diabetes, they may still benefit from avoiding refined carbs. It is also important to note that it's possible for many people to become overweight without having type 2 diabetes, although many factors influence the rate of weight gain in this population. For instance, women with breast cancer usually weigh less than men, but they often have more visceral adiposity, meaning they store calories in the abdominal area. This could make them heavier than would otherwise be expected (12). Vegetarians who are lean may actually have more muscle mass, allowing them to maintain their normal weight. As well, there are many other factors involved; see below.


Summary


The evidence shows that eating a diet free of saturated fats and cholesterol and containing","I do not know. If you are concerned about this, talk to your healthcare provider about it! You might be able to avoid some of the effects of insulin by avoiding high-fat foods and eating a low carb diet!

What is insulin?

Insulin is an enzyme which helps to manage blood sugar levels. It does this by converting glucose (sugar) into energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). This process is called ""diabetes management"". A person's body uses a certain amount of insulin over time as their blood sugars rise. Insulin works best when taken with food and can cause side effects if consumed without adequate nourishment. When insulin has been given, glucose will flow through the blood vessels faster so that there is less need for more insulin. As a result, the patient may feel hungry or hungry less often, feel tired or fatigued, or experience other symptoms including thirst or urination. It also takes longer for blood sugar levels to return to normal.

How is Type 1 diabetes diagnosed?

Type 1 Diabetes is caused by genetic defects in the pancreas (the cells where sugar is produced), hormone imbalances and other factors. Treatment includes regular check ups, nutrition counselling and lifestyle changes. The diagnosis is usually made when a person begins to have signs or symptoms of diabetes and their doctor suspects that they could develop the condition themselves at any point in life. Some people who are already diabetic have no symptoms; however, many find symptoms begin suddenly during pregnancy or shortly after birth.

Treatment options include anti-insulin drugs such as metformin and glucagon (when combined with oral medications) which act on both the pancreatic and endocrine systems, reducing the production of insulin and increasing the ability of blood glucose to pass freely from the bloodstream through the small intestine. These medicines help control glucose levels in the blood and prevent damage to surrounding tissues. In severe cases, treatment options include surgery. Surgery removes part or all of the large intestine, causing the pancreas to produce less insulin. However, this approach is often used only if there is significant damage to the intestines (e.g., injury to the gallbladder) or severe illness. Other treatments like oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) are used to monitor blood sugar levels throughout the day. OGGTs measure how well someone can tolerate taking an intravenous dose of glucose or another substance containing glucose. They determine whether this individual can continue eating without suffering complications."
35,Question: Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?\nAnswer:,"Absolutely, and this is the diet most often recommended by experts to help type 2 diabetics lose weight. But, like all diets, it can be tough to know exactly what's good for you – especially if you have an existing medical condition or are on medications that may interact with some other supplements. So, before going down this road, make sure you understand your specific needs.

Ketone bodies are secreted when glucose levels drop below about 70 mg/dL (2 mmol/L). When blood sugars fall too low, the body makes ketones in the liver (ketosis) and uses those as energy, which improves insulin sensitivity. Ketones also provide fuel to cells during periods of fasting. However, the amount of ketones produced depends on how much glucose is present in the bloodstream after meals. The more glucose there is in the bloodstream, the greater the production of ketones. In fact, many types of diabetes drugs inhibit the release of ketones from the liver. Therefore, although blood sugar levels tend to decline naturally over time, they're still very sensitive to fluctuations in blood glucose. It can take days to recover fully from a low-carbohydrate diet because of this sensitivity. A high-fat diet will result in a slower rate of ketogenesis. Because of this, a higher fat intake can cause weight loss and improve insulin resistance in type 2 diabetics – but at risk for kidney damage.

A ketogenic diet involves replacing carbohydrates with fats. Most foods are either partially or completely composed of animal products, such as eggs, meat, fish and dairy. Eating these foods helps maintain blood glucose levels while decreasing the need for insulin injections. Carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars called glucose, fructose and lactose, which enter the brain through the portal vein system, a collection of small arteries running between the kidneys. Once transported, the glucose, fructose and lactose leave via another branch of the same artery system.

Low carbohydrate diets can reduce blood pressure. High blood pressure is associated with diabetes, heart disease, stroke, hypertension and even death. People who develop cardiovascular problems appear to have less control of their blood sugars than normal-weight individuals, suggesting that chronic inflammation plays a role in contributing to high blood pressure. As mentioned above, some types of diabetes drugs suppress blood sugar and therefore have a negative effect on blood pressures. For example, patients taking Metformin are at increased risk of having elevated blood pressures. Diabetic ketosis can worsen any underlying health conditions and predispose someone to","Yes, it is. The main advantage of the ketogenic diet is that it allows you to focus on improving your physical health and overall wellbeing without suffering from malnutrition or hunger. It also enables you to eat more complex carbohydrates – such as those found in most starchy foods - when compared to an ordinary high-carbohydrate diet, which may lead to weight gain.

I'm going through my ketosis phase. What should I do now?

The best thing to do at this point is stay active – take regular walks, exercise regularly, keep some healthy snacks on hand etc. If you have been able to stick to your prescribed diets, then by all means continue to do so. However, if you are feeling depressed, anxious, agitated, unwell, tired, sick, weak, etc., then things are really getting out of control. This can be frustrating, because there's nothing quite like being faced with a choice between eating and taking medication. The solution? Stop eating and medicate yourself!\r

What can go wrong during ketosis?

This depends on what stage you're currently at. \r

If you've just started off from scratch (no prior experience), then the immediate effects can include depression, anxiety, headache, muscle aches and pains, lethargy, weakness, fatigue, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms usually subside within 24 hours, although they will often return after a day or two. As you progress through your own process of ketosis, these symptoms begin to lessen considerably over time. After 2-3 weeks of full ketosis, the symptoms typically recede completely. A few individuals remain ill, however, and some individuals develop complications related to their condition that require medical intervention. This can range from mild cases of hypoglycaemia, to severe cases where blood glucose levels drop below 140 mg/dL and require intensive treatment such as insulin therapy.\r

In a similar way, ketones are released in response to fasting, which helps stimulate the metabolism. However, ketones don't carry any beneficial benefits for those who aren't following a strict protocol. That said, they provide some support to patients whose immune systems have become compromised. As ketones release naturally, this has been shown to help alleviate both inflammation and infection. Additionally, low fat diets can cause side effects such as stomach upset,","Yes, it is. It has been shown to be safe and effective in patients who have type 2 diabetes.

It's also important to note that the current version of this page doesn't include the information needed if you want to try out ketosis as part of a low carb or keto diet. The links below do provide useful information about how to set up your own keto meal plan.","Yes! A low-carbohydrate (keto) diet is generally the best way to lose weight, and it's also one of the safest. There are many people who have no problem losing weight on this type of diet, but some people may need to cut back on their calories if they're already overweight or obese, as they have too much insulin resistance.

The carbohydrate in your body can be broken down into glucose – which is what you feel when you eat sugar – or it can be converted into fat. Low carbs tend to make your blood sugar drop more slowly than high carbs, so you don't notice any difference in how quickly your blood sugars go up or down. Some diabetic patients report feeling better on a low carb diet than others do; just like other types of diets.

If you're diabetic, then going a lower calorie diet will probably help you lose weight faster – you'll burn fewer calories during the day instead of having to keep eating at all times. But not everyone needs to go that route to lose weight or get healthy. The main thing you should think about is whether the diet works for you – there are plenty of diabetic foods available without harming your blood sugar levels.","Yes. A low carbohydrate, high fat diet has been shown to be effective for diabetes and heart disease, as well as reducing inflammation and maintaining healthy blood sugar levels in those with Type 2 Diabetes.

How many calories does a ketogenic / keto diet provide?\nThe average adult burns approximately 3,000 – 4,000 calories per day on a high-carbohydrate diet or 1,600 – 2,400 calories per day with an adequate protein intake. This means that a person consuming the typical American Diet would consume approximately 900 calories from carbohydrates and 150 calories from protein. The average American needs approximately 800 calories daily from fat, which is about 30 percent of his or her daily energy requirements (1). Therefore, it may take some time before your body will burn all of this excess food you have consumed through the week. It also takes time for your body to absorb new dietary nutrients (2). If you are starting off with an empty stomach, don't worry — you should still get plenty of nutrition throughout the rest of your week. However, if you have recently eaten very large amounts of food, then it's important to find out whether eating less will affect how much you need to eat in order to maintain a normal weight.

When can I start taking a Ketogenic / Keto Diet? You can begin following a ketogenic / keto diet at any point in your life when you are comfortable enough to do so. If you're interested in learning more about the benefits of a ketogenic / keto diet, then check out our article How to Start Eating A Low Carb Diet. For more information on the benefits of a low carb diet, please visit our page What's In Your Body If You Eat A Keto Diet?.

What foods do I eat while on a ketogenic diet? Do you recommend limiting the amount of carbs you consume?Yes, we strongly encourage everyone who is considering going ketogenic / keto to limit their carb consumption, particularly during times of stress. We often hear people say they want to lose weight but still feel satisfied, or that they've lost weight without having changed anything else in their lives. While these things are true, the truth is that most individuals cannot achieve significant weight loss by restricting one type of carbohydrate over another; rather, they must make changes within their lifestyle. For example, for a person who wants to improve their sleep patterns, they might cut back on caffeine and soda, or reduce meat and milk consumption. On the other hand, someone who wants to exercise","Ketosis is one of the benefits of a healthy lifestyle. This means that you should be eating lots of fruits and vegetables, reducing your carb intake to around 20-25% of your daily calories from carbohydrates (excluding any sugars or refined grains) and increasing it to at least 30% of your total calorie intake in order to maintain good health. There are no clear rules about how much carbohydrate an individual can eat on a daily basis during the day but this is generally recommended by doctors who believe that too little may cause weight gain and too much can damage the heart. It's also important not to overeat at meals because this will increase blood glucose levels and make you feel hungry again later in the day which would mean you'll need to eat more food.

If you're unsure about whether you can safely follow a low carb diet then don't worry! You can still have all the same great health effects as if you were following the Mediterranean diet but without having to worry about losing weight or eating too many calories. The key is to keep your carbs under 10g per kilogram bodyweight while maintaining a balanced meal plan which includes plenty of vegetables and fruit. If you already know that you can tolerate a lower carb lifestyle then you probably shouldn't have to worry about sticking to this for long as it won't take much effort to adjust once you've reached your goal weight.

A ketogenic diet is often better suited to individuals who suffer from type 2 diabetes than others who do not. Individuals with Type 1 Diabetes (where insulin resistance occurs) must consume between 200 and 400mg/day of insulin; however, since we know that ketone bodies exist throughout our bodies, a ketogenic diet could easily lead to excess blood sugar spikes which can lead to complications such as kidney disease, blindness, liver damage etc. We recommend avoiding any form of high carbohydrate snack during the day or evening in those with a history of diabetes. In addition to preventing any complications, these foods can actually help to decrease inflammation within the body and improve overall wellness by improving mood, improving appetite control and helping regulate blood pressure. So there's really no reason why anyone should avoid a ketogenic diet.","Yes! It is an effective treatment for type 2, 3 and 4 diabetics. The most common side effects of the ketogenic diet are weight loss and dehydration. For this reason, it should be used by someone who has not had success on other therapies or drugs such as insulin.

Diabetes in adults

How much does a ketogenic diet cost you?

It depends on how far along you have gotten into your program and how many years you've been diabetic. However, you can usually expect to pay anywhere between $150-$300 for a complete ketogenic diet. This includes everything from meal replacement shakes to customized nutrition plans.

What kind of protein do I need to eat to lose weight?

The amount of protein needed varies greatly depending upon where you fall on the BMI scale. Low-calorie diets such as low carb, low fat or Keto will help those with diabetes and prediabetic conditions achieve the best results.

Should I follow a ketogenic diet when my blood sugar levels get too high?

There's no evidence that a ketogenic diet causes hypoglycemia (low blood glucose). A ketogenic diet may even help those with Type 1 Diabetes to lose weight because they burn more calories than they take in during a normal day.

How long will it last?

A ketogenic diet may last up to 2 weeks on average. If you have diabetes and want to lose some weight, this could prove to be very helpful. However, if you have already started to experience significant weight gain, there's no real point in continuing. You'll likely find yourself eating fewer carbs and increasing protein. Try a few different meals to see what works well for you and then stick with it until you're satisfied.","The Ketogenic Diet is not the best choice for those suffering from Type 2 Diabetes, especially if you are diabetic. The Ketogenic Diet will make your blood sugar rise and give you an energy boost in the form of fat burning calories but it will also have negative side effects such as weight gain, insulin resistance, increased risk for heart disease and many more. It may be recommended by your doctor or a professional who has experience with Diabetes. However, it can help a person reduce their carbohydrate intake to some extent when they are on low carb diets. If you suffer from any other chronic condition that causes insulin resistance, then a lower carb diet might work better for you and may even cure your problem!

Q: How much protein should I consume during my ketogenic diet?

A: Your body needs about 20 grams per pound of lean muscle mass and 70 grams of total protein per day. For example, a 200 lb woman would need 3200-3000 grams of protein to maintain her healthy weight and healthy muscle mass. You can calculate these numbers on this website. Keep in mind, however, that this number does not take into account the amount of fats consumed (see below).

Protein sources include meat, poultry, seafood and nuts/seeds. Vegetables and fruits do not contribute to optimal health so a balanced diet needs to be supplemented with vegetables, fruit and milk products like yogurt. Eggs, cheese and eggs yolks are great sources of protein.

See the section above on how much carbs should I eat during my ketogenic diet. See also: What's the difference between carbohydrates and fats and why the distinction matters.


How much fat should I eat during my ketogenic diet?

Most people think of eating less fat because there's no room for excess calorie intake or ""bad"" fats such as saturated fat. But this isn't true. A good ratio of fat to carbs is 10:1 or higher (see the chart below). Also see our Fat Intake Chart which shows how much fat should be taken up by each food type.

Note that the recommendation for carb intake is based upon a 1500 kcal/day baseline and a person's daily activity level. A person at or above the normal metabolic rate can use 500 - 1000 extra calories per day.

When should I start my ketogenic diet?

Some doctors recommend starting your ketogenic diet after completing 1 month of a non-ketogenic diet. There are many reasons for doing this. Firstly, the lack of carbohydrate","Yes, you may eat it if you have Type 2 or Type 1 Diabetes. The body's ketones are needed to meet the body's needs. It is not necessary to drink any type of carbohydrate to achieve this; however, some carbs such as lactose and starchy foods will help keep blood sugar in check.

It has been reported that low-carb diets can be beneficial for those who are prediabetic (prevented by disease), but those with Type 2 Diabetes need to make sure they follow appropriate diabetic management strategies to avoid hypoglycaemia, insulin resistance and other complications associated with high blood glucose levels.

There is no doubt about whether a Ketogenic Diet is right for people with diabetes. However, you should take your health into account when choosing the best diet for your own unique circumstances.","Ketosis is associated with an improved metabolic status of the whole body, as well as reduced risk factors such as insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and obesity. In addition to lowering blood glucose levels, this condition may also improve insulin sensitivity in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus.

Is it right to eat carbs when I have diabetes? If you are diabetic, then yes. You should be careful about how much you consume if your blood sugar level is not controlled properly. But as long as you understand that it can lead to weight gain, don't worry too much because your health will benefit from eating some carb-rich foods."
45,Question: Can diabetes be cured?\nAnswer:,"Yes. Diabetes is a disease which can not be cured with medicines and diet. There are several ways of curing it, such as by using insulin.

The key to treating this disease is the removal of insulin from blood vessels and replacing it with glucose in the body. However, this process takes time. Insulin replacement therapy (insulin injections) is an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes but it takes approximately 3 months of continuous administration before the benefits become visible. The same is true when trying to treat other diseases like high cholesterol, hypertension, arthritis, cancer or even AIDS.

Another way of treating it is through lifestyle changes – eating more fruits and vegetables, getting regular exercise and controlling stress levels. This combination of treatments should be accompanied by appropriate medical care to prevent complications during and after treatment.","This is a question that has been asked for centuries. Some doctors have said it can be cured, but others have cautioned that this may not work or they are not sure how to cure it.

In the mid-1990s, an article in The Lancet reported that an experimental drug could bring down blood sugar levels. However, it was only for people with Type 2 diabetes and there were still many questions about whether this treatment would work for everyone. Researchers found that people who took the drug had lower blood sugars than those who did not take the drug. These results proved that the therapy worked; however, there were some concerns about long term effects on health.

There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. People with type 1 diabetes usually eat too much carbohydrates and their blood glucose level increases, which causes blood vessels to constrict and leads to inflammation. They also develop complications such as heart disease and kidney problems. Although these complications are less common among people living with type 2 diabetes, they can occur if they don't manage their condition. In addition, it's important to note that patients with type 2 diabetes have reduced insulin sensitivity and are more likely to experience low body weight (which is one of the most important factors contributing to obesity). It is also possible that lifestyle changes might help to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes over time, though further research will need to confirm this.","Yes.\r

1) Diabetes is a disease of the pancreas. This means that your cells have no control over their own production and secretion. Your blood sugar levels are often determined by factors other than what happens in your brain (your blood sugar level). The body regulates the amount of glucose in its bloodstream to prevent an overload on your liver's storage system. When your blood sugar goes too high, your liver turns off the hormone insulin, which prevents excessive thirst and weight gain. Unfortunately, this action causes your fat cells to produce more energy as compared to normal cells. As a result, you become hungry and want more food (metabolic syndrome), causing further damage to your organs and tissues. Also, since you're not getting enough nutrients from your diet, you'll need additional help from drugs called hormones or supplements (glycogen-depleting diuretics) to maintain good health.


2) A person with type 2 diabetes has a number of risk factors for heart attacks and strokes. These include having a family history of cardiovascular diseases, age older than 40 years, smoking or alcohol abuse, high cholesterol, being overweight, family history of cancer or heart disease, and obesity. Other risk factors for heart attack include hypertension, high triglyceride levels, and low HDL (""good"" cholesterol). These conditions increase your chance of developing a heart attack even if your initial diagnosis was correct. For example, if you had high triglycerides before, they will probably raise again after treatment, possibly leading to a heart attack. If you smoke and/or drink heavily, then your odds of developing a heart attack are increased. People with these lifestyle habits also tend to develop diabetes later in life.


3) Diabetics who eat a lot of refined carbohydrates are at an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. High glycemic index foods are generally loaded with extra sugars and calories. They may cause people to overeat, resulting in weight gain and metabolic problems. Additionally, many refined carbs contain large amounts of fiber, which slows down digestion and helps lower blood sugar levels. On top of all those things, eating refined carbohydrates may lead to inflammation in the body (a condition known as ""type 1 diabetes"").


4) Diabetics who aren't obese do better when they restrict carbohydrates and stay away from highly processed foods like white bread, white rice, and potatoes. However, keeping yourself lean doesn't mean that you won't have any trouble losing weight. It just takes some effort. You've got","Yes. \r


The number of people who will die from this disease in the next 100 years is a matter of serious concern. Some 5 million Americans have type 1 diabetes, and it is expected that by 2025 about half of these people will need to change their diets to prevent future complications or die of cancer. The risk to children under age 6 is higher than that for adults. There are more than 20,000 new cases of type 2 diabetes each year in the United States, and some 3 million people with type 2 diabetes are expected to develop it within the next 10 years. In addition, diabetes costs $7.2 billion per year.

Dr. Mark Hyman, a professor at Indiana University School of Medicine in Bloomington, said that if only one percent of the nation's population were diagnosed with diabetes, which he estimates to be somewhere between 4.1 million and 8.3 million, then those individuals would save an estimated $300 billion over their lifetime.

The main reason of your question is that the doctor or health professional may not believe that you have diabetes. It would take time and patience to convince them. You can seek support from your family, friends or anybody who has experience in treating diabetes.

How does diabetes affect my life?

Diabetes affects people differently. People with diabetes are often frail, confined to bed, often depressed and sometimes even suicidal. Some individuals manage their condition by taking insulin injections daily and eating food normally. Others need special diets to control their weight. Those who are severely obese may require a wheelchair to get around.

Can I lose my diabetes?

There may be some people with type 2 Diabetes who do not lose it completely. However, most Type 2 Diabetics have lost it at least somewhat and many don't regain it. This means that if you want to prevent developing Type 2 Diabetes, it's very important to follow all recommended precautions and diet to make sure that you do not develop this disease again.

Some people with type 2 Diabetes are also referred as ""insulin resistant"". Insulin resistance is caused by abnormal production of the hormone insulin (which controls blood sugar levels). If this happens, there is no way for your body to turn down the amount of glucose (sugar) that enters your bloodstream without causing trouble.

People with type 2 diabetes are also susceptible to certain infections such as hepatitis C and HIV. Therefore, it's essential that they practise regular exercise and avoid these diseases if possible. You should also see your GP regularly to check if you're having any illnesses that might indicate your diabetes is worsening.

What medications do diabetes patients use?

While there are many different types of medicines available which treat diabetes, they all work by inhibiting the action of sugar. In order for your body to get rid of excess sugar, you must take medication regularly (usually once a day). The following are some examples of medicine that help to regulate blood sugar levels, including those used to treat Type 1 Diabetes:

Antibiotics: Antibiotics are antibiotics used to kill bacteria. They cause problems for some people when taken too frequently. When they come into contact with certain drugs made by bacteria, there could be an allergic reaction (as with some antihistamines or allergy medications) which can lead to an illness called hyperglycaemia. These medications are usually only prescribed for short periods because they are less effective than other methods. However, since the risk of side","Yes.

Your condition will be monitored closely until it has improved to the point where you no longer require insulin or other medications.

51,Question: What is holistic medicine and what does it include?\nAnswer:,"According to the Health Care Practitioners (HCP) Act, which was passed in 2000, doctors are required by law to treat all patients with a ""comprehensive, integrated approach."" This includes an understanding of health and disease. The HCP Act further requires that physicians consult other physicians on any matter, including treatment, that has not been adequately dealt with by their own practice or clinical team. \n\http://www.healthcareforsupport.gov/index2.aspx

Question: When did the term ""integrative"" become widely known among medical practitioners?\nAnswer: In 1988, when Dr. John C. Cleland published The Principles of Integrative Medicine[1], he defined integrative medicine as being based upon the following principles:[2]

1) All processes within human life are interconnected, but individual actions may affect them differently and interactively; 2) There are no universal principles or systems in nature. Rather, they are interrelated by mutual influence and interaction between diverse components; 3) Human beings have a biological diversity that influences our experience of reality, thereby affecting how we think about ourselves and our environment; 4) Health can be achieved through interactions between various systems in order to create a more optimal state of living for all.

In other words, integrative medicine attempts to combine multiple facets of modern medicine into one system that works together, while at the same time providing effective treatments that work for everyone.

Question: What is the relationship between chiropractic and integrative medicine?\nAnswer: Chiropractic and Integrative Medicine (ICM) are complementary approaches to care focused upon the body's nervous system. It describes the role of nerve function, physical sensations, the body's ability to heal itself, as well as what happens as this system heals itself.[3] For example, ICM focuses on balancing nervous system functions such as balance, blood pressure, pain tolerance, digestion, immune health, sleep quality, coordination, etc., whereas chiropractic seeks to alleviate these symptoms in order to improve overall patient health.

Question: How do you distinguish chiropractic from ICM and why do you recommend a chiropractor as your primary physician?\nAnswer: Because chiropractic is based upon principles of natural healing, chiropractors cannot claim to provide only alternative methods of treating problems; instead, they use a combination of basic scientific techniques, traditional spinal manipulation techniques, and psychological therapies.[4] However, there is a difference between","This means all the elements of a health program, from diet to lifestyle.\n

What is holistic medicine in the context of human health? \nHealth is more than just a medical term; it has many meanings such as ""whole-person"" or ""being whole"".\n

Healthcare systems often have different goals and goals vary greatly between countries. For example, U.S. healthcare is very competitive, and people pay for services based on their personal beliefs. In Europe, however, there are no such restrictions. If you have high-risk conditions, even if you don't want to see your doctor, you can pay your way through your insurance company's network. Healthcare companies offer free or low-cost preventive and wellness care to everyone who needs it. Many countries also offer both Medicare coverage and private insurance to those with lower incomes. Medicare allows patients to receive financial assistance to help cover out-of-pocket costs for medications and procedures that are too expensive for most Americans to afford alone. The European system provides comprehensive coverage but requires beneficiaries to meet certain requirements, including maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, eating clean meals, and avoiding smoking.

What types of holistic doctors exist throughout Europe? \nIn Europe, conventional primary care physicians are required by law to practice holistic medicine. Traditional medicine practitioners often use herbal remedies, homeopathy, acupuncture, chiropractic therapy, osteopathic manipulation, and other forms of alternative medicine when treating symptoms or injuries. Some traditional medicines might be considered complementary because they do not contain any pharmaceutical ingredients. Alternative treatments may work best when combined with traditional therapies.\n

For some patients, the combination of medical interventions can produce results that conventional medicine could never provide. These are known as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). CAM uses natural and/or scientific approaches to treat illnesses. There are several CAM providers throughout Europe and practitioners frequently use different methods.

There are several reasons why people choose to use a particular form of medicine. They may believe that this is an effective treatment or that it will improve their overall quality of life. However, these choices aren't necessarily linked to how well the treatments actually work. Some people choose to rely primarily on CAM treatments to ease their pain or anxiety. Others may simply prefer the comfort of having an alternative form of medicine available to them. In either case, however, a physician must evaluate each patient's individual circumstances before recommending a specific type of treatment.

As a matter of fact, some CAM programs focus on certain parts","The term ""holistic"" has been used for several centuries to describe a range of approaches, both conventional and alternative, that seek to treat various diseases with integrated systems of medicines. \begin{equation} T_{H} = \frac{\partial F_\mathrm {cholesterol}}{A_\mathrm {vitamin A}} + \frac{\partial S_\mathrm {cortisol}}{A_\mathrm {vitamin B12}}\end{equation}\]

In summary, we can say that holistic treatment involves the use of complementary or integrative medicine techniques as well as traditional medical practice in an attempt to restore health or improve disease status by modifying the body's processes. When these changes are considered together and combined, they will result in improved physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual wellbeing. If you have questions about how to integrate your diet into your holistic treatment plan, please contact one of our experienced integrative nutritionists at 800-333-6227 x16 (USA).","The term ""holistic"" encompasses the treatment of a variety of diseases, disorders, and ailments. It also includes complementary and alternative therapies (CAT), such as acupuncture, yoga, aromatherapy, etc.


What is holistic medicine?

Holistic Medicine is a broad umbrella term that covers many different approaches to health care. However, in order for a person to be considered holistic, they must have the following four criteria:


The person must provide an approach that addresses all four components of the 4-step process, i.e.,


1) The patient must accept responsibility for their own health and well-being. This means they must take responsibility for managing their own health. Patients who do not believe or can't manage their own health are not holistic. They may have medical conditions that prevent them from taking control over their body's natural processes (diseases such as diabetes, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], heart disease, stroke, etc.), but these people would likely be referred by a specialist rather than treated.


2) All treatments are based on scientifically proven principles. These principles must be applied without judgment, prejudice, fear, ignorance, superstition, or personal bias. Treatments should not rely solely on placebo effects. People with no knowledge of how treatments work need not participate. Instead, treatments should be based on scientific evidence supported by clinical trials. If you are unsure about whether any given treatment works, ask your doctor before trying it out.


3) A holistic practitioner will use effective methods in a way that is consistent with the principle of preventive care. As an example, when treating a patient with high blood pressure, the primary goal should be to reduce his blood pressure and monitor his cholesterol level. To ensure there are no side effects caused by this change, a careful examination of each patient's blood pressure medication and diet is done prior to starting any new prescription regimen. Additionally, the practitioner must always observe patients' reactions during physical therapy sessions (including muscle contraction). Furthermore, he or she must have access to the same medications used in controlled clinical studies.


4) Holistic practitioners adhere to a specific set of values, such as respect for life, compassion, honesty, trustworthiness, integrity, integrity, integrity, and dignity. Holistic practitioners strive to live their lives according to these values. In addition, a person must be able to recognize when someone has violated one or more of the standards listed above.


How Does Holistic Medicine Work?","It includes everything that I have been talking about up until now.

It also includes the most ancient healing techniques, such as the use of herbs for curing ailments like cancer, diabetes, and many other diseases. And, it's also used in a variety of ways, such as by treating pain without drugs or surgery; helping children with autism; and even curing the common cold.

And, it is all natural. For instance, it was discovered that you can make a tea called ""yogurt"" from raw milk, or ""green tea."" And, it uses no antibiotics, hormones or toxic chemicals whatsoever. In fact, when people are treated at the University Hospital's Center for Integrative Medicine (CIM), they're given herbal supplements before treatment and after, which are made naturally from plants and minerals found in nature, not synthetically produced and chemically injected. And, it's extremely effective in correcting several physical illnesses including heart disease, cancer, and multiple sclerosis.

So, the reason why it doesn't involve expensive pharmaceuticals is because those are only used to treat diseases that require medical care. It has nothing to do with their ability to cure anyone else. It simply treats them in their own time and manner, which is more natural and beneficial than any medication ever could be.

I know this may seem rather simple, but it is quite complex. When you look into the benefits offered through this holistic approach, you will find much to enjoy and benefit yourself in the process. But don't worry – there's a great deal of information here to help guide your decision making.

Here are some points on how you can take advantage of this natural approach to health. You'll see, however, that it is very different from conventional medicine. As you read, you should feel inspired to choose the path to wellness…

What Is Natural Health?

If you want to find out what natural health is, then go ahead and skip down to the next section below. It really isn't difficult. The main point is that the term ""natural"" means something different depending upon what kind of food you eat. Here is a simplified list of what it all means.

Natural Food

As you probably know, eating organic foods is the best way to get the nutrients that are essential for healthy living. Organic foods contain less pesticides and chemical fertilizers, and they generally include ingredients that were never tested on animals, such as wild-caught fish and grass-fed beef. They are often grown","It includes all things that are organic, biodynamic, and/or non-animal. In other words, any substance or property not found in nature (except perhaps a few elements found naturally in the earth). \r

It also includes everything from natural products such as herbs, minerals, plant foods, and so forth to synthetic drugs that have been developed and refined to produce desired effects.\n

How can one be certain that one's body is not being used for medical purposes? \n\nThe way to know is to follow your doctor's orders. For example, if you have an infection or cancer, you should seek treatment immediately. If a practitioner prescribes a drug, then he has the authority to prescribe that medication without regard to whether there was a legitimate reason for its use in the first place. The only exception would be when the drug itself causes serious harm. This is a good rule of thumb. But if this is the case with the prescribed medicine, then the patient needs to pursue alternative treatments. \n\nIf this is not the case, then the practitioner may not perform his duties according to a proper form of ""integrative"" medicine. For example, a person who has had a heart attack at home may not get a transplant there. However, if that person went to a hospital where they did receive a transplant (for instance, a large kidney), then the individual could go back home and continue using those organs as long as he has not received any new transplants since. The same principle applies if another organ is being replaced. It is not possible to take a pill that kills you while the body still functions. Another example: Someone is having a heart attack on their own, and they find out that the doctors have tried to prevent the heart attack by administering antibiotics. When the doctor gets out of bed, he starts taking the antibiotic, but before they can finish taking it, the man passes away. Why do we call these cases of death ""natural""? Because people die naturally all over the world all the time. The only thing different about our daily lives is that we try to protect ourselves against illness and death through some kind of organized action. Allowing for exceptions, we can say that anyone can become healthy and strong simply by following proper care; however, if someone uses pharmaceuticals that will end up killing them instead of saving them, then we need to speak up loudly to stop this abuse. We must support legislation that prevents doctors from prescribing harmful prescription medications to patients. For example, one","There are many different types of holistic medicine. In some cases, you will find that the name of a specific type of treatment may change depending on the region or country where the practitioner lives. For example, in Asia, acupuncture is often called Chinese traditional medicine, but there are also practitioners who practice this form of medicine in North America. In general, holistic medicine includes several different practices and treatments. The most common examples of these therapies include homeopathy (a form of alternative medicine that uses the principles of chemistry to treat diseases) and acupuncture (which has its origins in ancient China). Many other types of complementary and alternative therapies are not included in the definition. So if you want to learn more about a particular kind of therapy, please visit our website for further information.

Q: How can I get started with my own clinical study?

A: You can contact your local research center if you have questions regarding how you can apply for research funding. Alternatively, you can attend a seminar at the National Academy of Sciences' Institute for Basic Science, which will provide detailed guidance on how to start a study.

Q: Where can I go to see the world's largest collection of animal specimens? \r

A: One of the finest collections of animal fossils in the world resides at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., and it contains millions upon millions of animals from across the globe. It also houses over 2 million bones and skulls of dinosaurs, mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish. Additionally, the Museum is home to one of the world's largest collections of living plants, including over 3 million trees, 900 species of flowering plants and 600 species of fungi. This incredible collection helps scientists understand just how diverse life was around the time humans appeared on earth.\r

\r

Q: What is genetic engineering? How did we come up with it?

A: Genetic engineering is an approach to modifying DNA sequences without affecting natural cellular processes. The first genetically modified organisms were developed by scientists at Harvard University and their colleagues between 1968 and 1971. Since then, biotechnology has led to numerous innovations, such as the creation of proteins that make it possible to produce drugs like insulin, antibiotics and vaccines using cells that do not need blood to survive. At the same time, biologists are developing technologies that would enable us to better understand the evolution of human traits through studies of embryonic development. These techniques include gene editing, cloning, synthetic biology, tissue engineering, genomic analysis and molecular diagnostics. Some of","You might think that there are two definitions of holistic medicine. The first definition is the one used by the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians, which includes ""a system of complementary therapies based on a multidisciplinary approach to healing."" \nThe other definition would be the one used by the International Society for Integrative Medicine (ISIM), which includes ""integrating all aspects of health into a therapeutic model that has been proven effective in promoting positive effects in patients with various disease states."" In other words, an integrative doctor may practice both types of medicine simultaneously. \nAccording to ISIM, there are many different kinds of holistic medicine, but they generally tend to focus on four basic components: \n1. Healing through the body's natural systems.\n2. Healing through our emotional and psychological systems.\n3. Healing through our spiritual or religious systems.\n4. And finally, healing through consciousness. \nWhat is your take on this? Can you share some of your thoughts about this matter? I've read several articles over the past few years discussing the difference between traditional and alternative approaches to holistic healthcare. For example, Dr. Sohrab Nafisi wrote an excellent article entitled ""Is There A Difference Between Traditional and Alternative Health Care?"" In my opinion, they don't make much sense from an unbiased perspective because everyone can benefit from each kind of care. So far, I haven't come across any scientific studies proving that there isn't a clear distinction between these different ways to heal, but perhaps there will someday. It could just as well be that there are no differences at all. One thing is for certain though; people are constantly searching for the ""right"" medicine and if we ignore all science-based facts like evolution or nature itself, then the whole medical field becomes irrelevant. But that doesn't mean we should reject science altogether! People are often swayed by sensational stories and unfounded claims made without any evidence whatsoever, but if you're looking for something real, look up actual research done by scientists. If you're still skeptical, consider that even some mainstream doctors accept the concept of humanism - or, rather, its opposite: agnosticism. I'll leave it up to you to decide which one makes more sense, but my advice would be to stick with the idea that we shouldn't believe everything we read or hear. This also applies to how we treat ourselves. How do we treat ourselves when we have doubts? I'm not trying to pick on chiropractors, but if you","The word ""holistic"" comes from the Greek term holos, which means to take in everything. In other words, if you are healthy all the time, then you are a holistic practitioner and not just some kind of herbalist who makes tea for your ailments.

Many people think that all health problems can be solved with remedies and pills that require expensive ingredients. You might be surprised by the fact that many conventional treatments do work but they don't help with all diseases. Many common illnesses are caused or exacerbated by lifestyle choices, so you need to make sure you stay healthy long enough to get the best results possible.


The good news is that this approach will also result in a happier life and better quality of life as well as the possibility to have more grandchildren and other loved ones! The following article is about how holistic medicine works (and how easy it actually is)…

Holistic Medicine (Or, How Holistic Doctors Work)

[This article originally appeared on www.mumdaddyman.com]","The word ""healing"" as used in a medical context has two meanings. One meaning of the word is ""the treatment or cure by which health is restored to an injured, ill, diseased or sick body."" As part of that definition, holistic doctors are treating their patients with natural healing methods (including herbal medicines). Another meaning of the word is ""a system of thought and practice based on sound science and principles derived from the Bible, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Taoism, Christianity, Judaism, Islam and all other religions that seeks to restore balance between man and nature by means of the application of proper food, clothing, shelter, rest and relaxation.""

The term ""holistic"" is also frequently confused with ""holistic,"" which means ""of the same nature."" But this isn't entirely accurate. Holistic medicine can be both ""natural"" and ""cosmetic"" treatments; they may have many similarities but also differences. For example, some people use supplements without knowing whether any of them work. In fact, you don't need a doctor's prescription for most types of supplements--they come in pill form. Some uses for herbs, vitamins, minerals and dietary supplements vary greatly because each one has its own unique purpose and needs. In addition, there is no set standard for what constitutes a ""holistic"" approach to wellness. Many holistic practitioners try to apply all of these different methods to achieve optimal health in their patients. This variety makes sense when considering how often different therapies are applied in our daily lives. Each method is equally effective, though using one can help a patient heal more quickly than another.

How does holistic medicine differ from conventional medicine? To answer this question, let's take a look at the following list of common treatments:

1) Drugs: Most drugs are categorized as either drugs or dietary supplements. These substances affect human behavior and physiology so they must be evaluated individually before being prescribed. By contrast, holistic physicians evaluate all possible causes of illness and propose remedies based on scientifically proven and validated principles. Examples of commonly recommended pharmaceuticals include anti-depressants (such as Prozac), antipsychotic medications such as Risperdal, antidepressants (like Paxil, Zoloft, etc.), muscle relaxants such as Tylenol and muscle relaxers (such as Aloe Vera/Glycerol). The FDA, however, requires manufacturers to provide specific warnings about side effects before prescribing certain products to children under 16 years old, pregnant women, and those with heart disease"

How can I prevent or manage the most common mental health problems?\nAnswer:,"There is a wide range of mental health conditions that can affect people. Some common symptoms include anxiety, depression, and phobias. There are many different types of mental health disorders such as anxiety disorders, mood disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), eating disorders, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), panic attacks, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and schizophrenia.

What are some signs and symptoms of depression?

Signs and Symptoms of Depression Some Signs of Depression Your mood seems to fluctuate between depressed and happy. You may feel sad all the time or you might not show any sadness at all. This can be due to an underlying problem such as feeling down emotionally or being upset because of something you did or saw. Depression may also make it hard to concentrate in school and work. It's important to remember that this doesn't mean you should give up completely or take your life into your own hands. You need professional support. See our Treatment section for more information about treatment options for depression. Other things that may cause you to have low mood may include: Stress

A bad day at work

Losing weight

Being sick or injured (including injuries from sports)

Falling asleep at night

Moving around too much

Feeling tired even though you're exercising When talking about your mood changes with others, try to express yourself clearly. Your feelings won't change if you keep quiet. Try to listen carefully to what they say. Also try to find out when it has happened before so you know exactly what to expect next time. If you notice things changing, ask someone close by to talk to you. Learn more about how to communicate better with loved ones.

Symptoms of Anxiety Anxiety can often feel overwhelming. It can happen suddenly or over time. But it happens to everyone. And it could be caused by something specific or something unrelated to your health condition. The main symptoms of anxiety include: Thoughts or fears about something serious happening to you or your family

Fear that things will go wrong

Restlessness

Trouble concentrating or remembering things

Difficulty sleeping

Irritability

Running around in circles

Racing thoughts or feeling anxious

Feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness","When it comes to depression and anxiety, there is a number of different factors that contribute to a person's difficulties. Understanding these factors will help you develop and maintain coping skills for managing your own feelings of anxiety and depression and preventing them from becoming more chronic and damaging in some way. A variety of research studies have found that people with depression and anxiety tend to exhibit symptoms such as sadness, low self-esteem, feelings of guilt and shame about their depression and anxiety, social isolation and loneliness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more difficult it becomes to live a healthy life, the greater the likelihood of developing depression or anxiety. Depression and anxiety often start within the first 10 years of life. If you're concerned about your emotional well being, try taking steps to reduce stress by exercising regularly or decreasing caffeine consumption. While a healthy lifestyle isn't always possible, taking small steps toward improving your mood each day may improve your outlook on your illness. In fact, one study showed that reducing physical activity by at least 15 minutes per week resulted in an 83% decrease in depressive symptoms. Another research study suggested that eating foods rich in vitamins C and E may be helpful in helping with depression and anxiety. Some research suggests that taking antidepressants may not only alleviate symptoms but also increase recovery time. For example, taking SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) for at least 4 weeks following a relapse was shown to speed up the healing process of patients who had relapsed after having been treated successfully with other treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy. \r

Some of these disorders can be managed by lifestyle changes, while others require medication and/or therapy. Mental illness often comes in pairs—one momentary episode may interfere with our daily activities and leave us feeling sad and out-of-place, and the next day it all goes away. The causes of mental illnesses can include physical conditions such as diabetes, depression, anxiety, and eating disorders; psychological factors like relationship difficulties, parental struggles, and childhood trauma; social circumstances (such as being raised by a family member who suffered from mental illness); and environmental factors (such as isolation or poor communication skills).\r


Many people find themselves experiencing multiple mental health issues at once, so they're better served if they seek help for each one. However, there are some things you can do before getting involved in treatment, including talking to your doctor about any other potential problems in your life and asking questions about why you have them. If you suspect you or someone else is suffering from an emotional disorder, such as low self-esteem, anger management, or self-harm, please contact: National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) or Beyond Blue Crisis Line (1-866-488-7386).

It is important to realize that not all individuals with these disorders will have a single issue and that everyone's symptoms may be different in some way. The following list of mental health issues has been compiled by a national advisory board and provided as a resource for you to consider when seeking help for your own psychological problems.

The Anxiety Disorders Association of America recommends that anyone who experiences any kind of severe, persistent or recurrent fear, panic attacks or other major anxiety symptoms should seek professional treatment immediately.

Depression is a mood condition where a person feels sadness, sadness associated with loss or loss of personal purpose, feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness or self-blame. Sometimes people experience depression even after they stop taking medication for their depression. Some studies suggest that suicide attempts and attempts at self harm increase significantly during periods of chronic depression. Learn more about treating depression.","Depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. All of these disorders are associated with a higher risk for suicide. It is important to understand that they do not all have one single cause but rather multiple causes in combination. Therefore, it is very difficult to know what may be causing them. As long as you take steps to reduce your stress levels, improve your quality of life, and avoid substance abuse or other negative emotions (like anger) when stressed, you should still be able to live an adequate quality life.

The main focus of this article is on depression and related psychiatric illnesses including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In particular, this article focuses on those people who suffer from these illnesses and their impact on their lives. However, the topics covered here will also apply to people suffering from more serious mental illnesses such as borderline personality disorder or major depressive disorder.

What are the most common mental health problems?

Mental illness can affect anyone, regardless of age or gender. The following list includes specific symptoms that indicate a possible mental illness:

Feelings of worthlessness or hopelessness which may lead to intense feeling of worthlessness or hopelessness. This can often manifest itself as low self-esteem and/or depressed moods.

Trouble concentrating, thinking clearly or remembering things.

Avoidance of tasks that involve social interaction or activities that could make others uncomfortable, like attending sporting events, going out with friends, or taking part in extracurricular activities.

Anxiety

Insomnia

Irritability or irritability.

Difficulty sleeping or staying asleep.

Inability to concentrate or stay focused.

A fear of change, even something small such as a change in clothing style, house décor, surroundings or environment.

Depression

Symptoms of depression vary based on the type of depression and how severe it is. Symptoms include:

Numbness or numbness of one or both arms or legs.

Changes in appetite or weight loss.

Loss of interest in normal activities.

Decreased ability to concentrate.

Poor sleep or disturbed sleep patterns.

Feeling sad or empty or having feelings of emptiness.

Persistent thoughts of death or suicide.

Feeling sad about being unable to cope with problems in daily life.

Feelings of guilt or shame or having negative thoughts about yourself.

Frequent worrying or ruminating about problems that have no relevance or solution.","Some people may experience many of the same symptoms as others. So, it's best to get diagnosed and see a doctor if you believe you have any of these signs. For example, some people with ADHD often report depression or anxiety as well, so it might be helpful for them to consult their doctors about those conditions as well. If you think you have an underlying problem with your mind that needs help, you should talk to a healthcare professional about getting treatment. It is especially important for kids who are younger than 5 years old to get evaluated by medical professionals before they start taking medication.


What causes mental health problems?

If you've had the disease of mental illness since childhood, such as bipolar disorder (manic-depressive disorder), schizophrenia, major depressive disorder (MDD) or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), then there is a greater chance of developing mental illnesses later in life. These disorders do not all occur at once. You may develop one type and another type within the same family or family group. As children grow up, however, they usually become more tolerant of being different from other people, especially when it comes to emotions. At times, this tolerance can lead to inappropriate behavior. In adults, certain types of moodiness and irritability seem to be normal or even healthy. But too much of one kind of emotion leads to mood swings and a range of behavioral issues. This is why some people seek professional psychiatric care for psychological problems.


How can I tell if my child has mental health concerns?

It can be hard to know what to look for because mental health affects everyone differently. Some parents may feel that a particular behavior or attitude is unusual or odd, but they don't know how to explain it to their child. Your baby, toddler or preschooler will need extra guidance on how to interact with other people. To avoid having this happen to them, discuss this issue with them directly. You'll also want to pay attention to things like eye contact, smiling, eye contact and physical activity; these can be indicators of emotional stability. Keep in mind that mental health may go unnoticed until adulthood. Sometimes we miss warning signals until someone else tells us to. Here are some tips:

Don't take advantage of a person's bad moods to make yourself feel better.

Avoid making smalltalk to strangers unless you're really sure you understand each other.

Be sure to say ""Thank you"" after talking to someone without thinking of what you were going to say first","While it is true that many people suffer from more than one mental health disorder, most of these disorders have a unique set of symptoms and symptoms should be assessed individually. In addition to assessing your symptoms, you also need to assess your family history for each diagnosis (including bipolar disorder). Some common types include anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and borderline personality disorder. The type of treatment used depends on the severity of the problem. For example, some patients may respond better to medications such as antidepressants, while others will benefit by getting counseling. You should get in touch with your doctor before starting any new treatment plan because many conditions require medication. Most chronic illnesses do not cause signs or symptoms. If you're concerned about possible mental illness, talk to your doctor.","The most common mental health problems include depression, anxiety and eating disorders. The following questions will help you to identify these conditions: 1) Do you have symptoms of any of the following? a) Major depressive disorder (MDD). b) Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). c) Eating disorders (EDs). d) Anxiety disorders. e) Stressful events. f) Personality disorders. g) Panic attacks. h) Sexual dysfunction. i) Trauma-related symptoms. 2) What is your age? 3) What are your gender characteristics? 4) Which of the following is the most common type of mental illness? a) Depression. b) Anxiety. c) Somatization. d) Bipolar disorder. e) Obsessive-compulsive disorder. f) Eating disorders (EDs). g) Bulimia nervosa. h) Self-harm. 6) Are there other types of mental illnesses that you experience? 7) Which of the following would be considered as psychological illnesses? a) Psychosis or delusional disorder. b) Schizophrenia. c) Depressive mood swings. 8) If you had no family history for any of the above, which of these would you consider as being more likely to cause it in a child: a) Alcohol abuse. b) Smoking or drug abuse. c) Physical neglect. d) Social isolation. 9) When did your childhood begin? 10) What were the major changes in your life when you started school? a) A decrease in social interaction with peers and teachers. b) Decreased interest in reading books. c) Decreased interest in sports. d) Increased isolation from friends and family. 11) What has been the biggest change in your life since starting school? 12) Is your life organized at all? 13) Has your social skills improved since you began school? 14) What activities do you enjoy doing? 15) Have you ever experienced physical, sexual, or emotional abuse? 16) Would you consider yourself an introvert or an extrovert? 17) If so, what is your personality type? 18) Do you like getting into trouble? 19) Does someone else in your family seem very outgoing and sociable? 20) Did you know your father abused drugs and alcohol? 21) Were there any members of your family who smoked cigarettes regularly? 22) Was there anyone in your family who drank alcohol regularly? 23) Do you feel lonely sometimes because of some of the things that happen around you? 24) Do","This question is not specific to depression, but it does need to be answered. You must consider which mental illness you have and whether it is a serious one. If you have major depressive disorder (MDD), your doctor may suggest that you stop taking antidepressants immediately. They are often helpful in treating mood swings, feelings of emptiness, sadness and loneliness.

If you do not want to quit all antidepressant medications, or if they make you feel worse, discuss this with your psychiatrist. He or she will tell you what further treatment options might be available for you at home or in an outpatient setting. These treatments also include psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In addition, antidepressants may help you deal more effectively with stressors such as divorce or job loss.

You should also talk to your family members about their own experiences with mental illness. Often children of depressed parents experience more symptoms than other children of depressed parents. It can help if someone with bipolar disorder knows that his or her parent has been diagnosed with some form of mental illness. The mental illness may be treated by medication or therapy. Some people who suffer from bipolar disorder cannot tolerate the side effects of these drugs and will try alternative therapies such as meditation, yoga, or cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) if there is no effect on symptoms. Learn about your options so that you can choose the best ones for yourself.

What can we do to improve our mental health?

In addition to practicing good habits, we can take steps to ensure our emotional well-being and physical health as we age.

Meditation. Meditation helps us reduce anxiety and promote relaxation while maintaining focus and attention. There are many different types of meditation styles, including body scan, mantra, and visualization techniques. While mindfulness meditation helps you see the bigger picture, it doesn't replace traditional psychological approaches such as social skills training or talking about important topics. For example, if you want to become stronger physically, keep active and learn how to strengthen the muscles involved in walking, biking and lifting heavy objects.

Mood management. Medication and therapy work together to treat certain symptoms and prevent others. Depression, panic attacks and phobias often develop during periods of distress. Mood disorders such as anxiety, OCD and PTSD tend to worsen over time because of changes in our bodies and minds. We don't know everything about each person's genetics, brain chemistry or genetic predisposition. So getting better information through research and education is crucial.

Emotional support. A variety of services —","There is no one single answer to this question. A person's physical and social environment plays a significant role in their mental health, and often the individual has had some form of adversity that contributed to their condition. However, for the majority of people who suffer from any mental illness, the problem does not stem entirely from an issue within the individuals' own mind. In fact, research shows that many people do not experience symptoms until after they have experienced at least two life-threatening events (e.g., sudden death, accident, serious injury). Mental Health Awareness Month presents a unique opportunity to highlight these important issues so we may help reduce instances of suicide and other forms of mental illness for all Americans. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) has developed an annual theme for April 20th called ""Suicide Prevention"" which highlights how best to reduce suicides in our society through education and prevention programs. Each year, the APA also releases a report entitled ""The Facts About Suicide,"" which provides information about the risk factors of suicide, as well as some specific actions you can take."
53,Question: what is psychotherapy?\nAnswer:,"Psychotherapy is a form of therapy that focuses on the way we experience, understand and respond to our emotions, thoughts and actions. It can be used to help you deal with any problem or challenge you face in your life.

A great place to start with psychotherapy is with an individual therapist who has extensive experience working with children and young people. Some therapists will also provide a range of services including group sessions, couples therapies and parenting groups.

If you don't want to work through a formal counselling process with one particular practitioner, there are many other ways in which you might find support. For example, a friend, family member, social worker, clergyperson or carer could all offer their support, while online resources such as MeetUp groups or Facebook Groups may have resources available for those needing advice about issues around mental health or wellbeing.

Alternatively, if you're already experiencing some sort of distress, it's worth visiting the nearest GP clinic. You'll get the best results when you talk directly to a doctor (or nurse) rather than talking to someone else at the same time. If you need regular appointments, make sure that the appointment details are up-to-date.

Some forms of psychotherapy are offered by community mental health services or private clinics. These tend not to offer a specific service specifically tailored to adults, though they do often offer a wide variety of psychological treatments – from CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy), mindfulness meditation, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and exercise regimes to medication treatments like psychosurgery or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). There are various types of treatment available so check each website for more information.

The NHS offers an excellent range of different types of psychotherapy, based on age, ability and severity of problems. Check what type you should receive and how much it costs before contacting your local hospital.","a process of changing the way you feel and experience yourself.


What I like about it is that it helps people to open up, be honest with themselves, be vulnerable, and understand how their thoughts affect them emotionally, physically, and intellectually. It's not just for depression or anxiety. If your mind has been closed off from someone else then therapy may help bring you back into the world and take control of your emotions.

Laurie · 10 years ago","Psychotherapy has come to be seen as one of the most successful methods for treating mental illnesses. It focuses on helping you accept who you are and how you feel about yourself and your experiences.

This page will answer some common questions about psychotherapy, including its place in psychology and its role in clinical practice.

What is psychotherapy?

When we say ""psychotherapy"", it doesn't mean that you get into a session, go through a list of questions and then put them away until you're done. Psychotherapy is more like watching movies or listening to music while talking with someone. You don't actually have to sit down and listen to the words being spoken (or even move your head). Rather, when you speak the answers are given to you so you can ask specific questions (called questions) to get an understanding of what happened, whether it was traumatic, beneficial or harmful. So just like reading a book or listening to a piece of music, if you want help you should listen and understand rather than simply watch the movie and then try to figure out how things work out. In fact, most of us spend a lot of time trying to figure out our feelings by asking questions!

So why do people need this kind of therapy? What sort of changes might be caused by treatment? Why does this type of treatment make a difference? Here are some of the reasons:

To learn better ways to manage depression.

In order to reduce the risk of suicide.

To help someone else find relief from pain or stress.

If you've ever heard of some form of psychotherapy, then this page may seem familiar.

What is psychological testing?

Most psychologists now use psychological tests called diagnostic interview tools to gather information to identify patients who may benefit from treatment. These instruments are often used to test whether a patient's symptoms and thoughts match those shown in a questionnaire or whether they contain warning signs of potential problems such as suicidal ideation or behavior. The tool also assesses sensitivity to medication, how well a patient responds to therapy, and what types of treatments are helpful for each person. For example, a therapist could suggest that a person take anti-depressants first to rule out other possible causes of his/her symptoms before deciding which ones to continue to receive. Or perhaps a client would prefer to see a psychologist instead of taking antidepressant medications right now. To read more, please see these articles.


Why do psychologists use psychotherapy?

For many","it's a process by which people work on themselves, their relationships and problems. \nThere are several types of therapy that can be used in the treatment of depression. The most commonly-used therapy, though, has to do with self-help techniques such as exercise or mindfulness meditation. These methods can help you better understand how your mind works, so you might find them helpful in improving your mental health. They also can give you an insight into why certain things happen to you. For example, if you have trouble focusing when you're at the gym, meditating may help improve your ability to focus, especially if you think that working out causes stress. You'll probably need to try both approaches for a while before finding one that works best for you. Another type of therapist is called a cognitive behavioral therapist. A CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) therapist uses a set of questions, known as an ""examination,"" to ask people about their thoughts and feelings. This way they can figure out whether your current mood isn't just due to something else or whether your problem is actually a problem with yourself. When this method is used correctly, you'll notice that thinking will come much easier. One of the basic principles of cognitive behavior therapy is ""change through transformation."" That means that if your symptoms seem to worsen over time, then you probably don't want to blame anything outside yourself - you should instead look inside and make changes right now. Sometimes the best thing to do is to get advice from others who know how to deal with depression. In some cases, there are groups that provide support for people going through a difficult time. There are even books available that explain more about depression and its treatments. You also can contact someone you trust and talk to them about what's happening with you. Depression is very common; 1 out of 10 Americans will experience depression in his/her lifetime. But while many people see their depressive episodes as being temporary, many other doctors believe that depression lasts for life. And in fact, this is true. It's estimated that 80 percent of all U.S. adults will develop depressive symptoms during their lifetimes. Because depression can take a long time to kick in, it can also lead to serious illnesses. Unfortunately, getting help doesn't always mean that you'll go back to your old level of functioning, but it does mean that you'll learn lessons about how to cope with depression and get better.","Psychotherapy (also called psychoanalysis) refers to a particular type of treatment in which the patient learns how to manage his or her problems through the use of psychological techniques.\r

For example, when you are stressed, you might work on your anger and find ways to relieve it by concentrating on something else. You may also learn relaxation techniques that help you go back to sleep without having nightmares, or you can practice relaxation techniques with other people around you in order to make them feel relaxed as well. By using such techniques, you will be able to take control over your emotions and become more aware of your feelings. You can change your behavior so that they do not come up anymore. This way you won't have to keep repeating them all day long. In addition, if you don't like your therapist's methods, just ask him/her for another one! The more you know about therapy, the easier it becomes to do this yourself. For information about how to get started see my page on How To Find A Therapist. \r

What does psychotherapy look like? When you are feeling down or distressed, you might try talking about it with someone who knows what you are going through. Sometimes you need to talk to somebody who has been there before and understands what you really want. If possible, let your therapist know that you are ready to talk about something important; however, you must be very clear about exactly what you want to say. You can use this kind of information to develop a plan of action to deal with whatever problems you are having right now. Therapy is not about changing things inside your head; rather, it is about helping you recognize those parts of yourself that aren't working at the moment. While some types of therapy involve talking about specific problems, others involve examining aspects of your life that you think are bothering you. It might help to write down everything you've ever thought of as ""bad"" about yourself, then read this list of these bad thoughts so that you can start making changes. Once you start thinking about how things could be different, your mind will begin to question itself. Psychotherapists sometimes try to encourage such questioning with questions such as this one: What should I tell myself that would encourage me to stop being unhappy? Or, what words of encouragement can I give to myself to help me get rid of negative beliefs?\r

How do I decide whether to seek professional help for certain kinds of problems? Some kinds of problems that require treatment include depression, anxiety disorders, eating","the process of seeking insight into one's own psychological processes in relation to a specific situation or problem. It may be done by using either a single session, with an experienced therapist or group; or more frequently, by using several sessions for different problems and situations, often over a period of weeks or months. The aim of therapy is not merely to help people become better in some way, but rather to enable them to solve their problems effectively on their own and work through the problems themselves. A psychiatrist may also use psychotherapy to identify causes and factors which might have contributed to a particular experience. This can include examining a person's past experiences, feelings, attitudes and beliefs about their life and relationships (such as why they are feeling this way), and considering their thoughts and feelings about what has happened to them so far and how it will affect the future. The primary focus of psychotherapy is to provide the individual with tools, information, skills and techniques to facilitate personal growth and self-awareness.

There are many types of therapy:

Psychological (psychodynamic) therapy : based on a theory that holds mental states and emotional reactions are caused and influenced by underlying physiological processes. Psychotherapists use both cognitive and affective approaches to attempt to understand how we come to respond emotionally and psychologically to various situations and challenges. They seek to develop a client's ability to think clearly, reflect on his/her behaviour, learn to manage feelings appropriately, cope in stressful circumstances and improve communication and relationship quality.

They seek to develop a client's ability to think clearly, reflect on his/her behaviour, learn to manage feelings appropriately, cope in stressful circumstances and improve communication and relationship quality. Behavioural (behavioural) therapy: Based on theories about how emotions function and interact with our minds, behaviours and environments, behavioural therapists try to find ways of helping clients deal successfully with negative and challenging events, and establish positive routines and changes. They try to teach clients new strategies, ideas and techniques, such as changing habits, learning to communicate effectively, working independently, adjusting to change, and developing a sense of control. Some psychologists consider themselves primarily concerned with improving clients' abilities to understand and interpret stressors, while others are more interested in understanding how to reduce these.

Based on theories","Psychotherapy, more broadly defined, refers to the treatment of a range of mental disorders by means that focus on changing and integrating personal experiences into one's thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. It involves both cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy, which are approaches to working with patients in their everyday lives as well as within institutions and larger groups. Both CBT and IPT have been shown to be effective at treating anxiety and depression symptoms and stressors, while also being very useful for managing other life challenges such as relationship problems.

The American Psychiatric Association defines CBT as follows:

""Effective CBT employs an integrated approach to treatment based upon the principles and concepts of psychoanalysis, existential psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy, developmental theory, dialectical behavior therapy, therapeutic collaboration, and interpersonal psychotherapy.""\r

Psychoanalysis is considered an analytic philosophy of mind (i.e., an understanding of mental states), whereas existential psychology focuses on individual human experience. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy refers to psychological practices aimed at improving social functioning and self-esteem through various methods that involve applying rules and procedures derived from psychology or sociology. The concept of interpersonal psychotherapy has been developed to address social issues associated with relationships, including conflict resolution, interpersonal communication, dating relationships, intimacy, and relationship maintenance.

IPT seeks to improve people's relationships with each other and with others by focusing on individuals' perspectives and actions. It attempts to develop a sense of belonging within this group so that people can see themselves in meaningful ways and can feel good about who they are and where they come from. Intimate therapist/patient work has traditionally involved talking with clients, listening closely to how they describe and act out their emotional needs, and then helping them identify and deal with those needs. Interpersonal therapist work emphasizes discussing and resolving conflicts among patients. This may be done either face-to-face or via video conferencing systems, using a variety of techniques such as eye contact, eye gaze management, nonverbal cues, and gentle touch. Interpersonal therapists typically take on the role of ""protective parent,"" providing guidance and support to clients during times when it seems important to talk openly and constructively with their partner(s). Many aspects of this work will require ongoing training, but the basic premise remains the same: building client trust and competence in order to bring about real change. Most interprofessional therapists hold certification in both IPT and CBT. Some research shows that IPT is even more successful than CBT in addressing some","to understand how and why we feel the way we do.

Psychotherapy has two aspects: 1) helping people learn to change their behavior (2) changing our attitudes about ourselves or others in order to improve outcomes for ourselves, our family and society. Psychologists define a behavior as anything that affects another human being - whether it's making someone angry, controlling them, avoiding them, hurting them. The goal of therapy is not only to help us become better people, but to make us more compassionate, understanding, loving, respectful, empathetic, and caring.

Asking yourself questions like ""what is empathy?"" ""how does my behavior affect other people"", ""do I act out because I am afraid/insecure?"", or ""are people hurt by me"" will get you a much deeper look at your relationship with others - and hopefully help you change it!

In this article, I'm going to give some examples of things psychologists say can trigger anger, which are known as ""triggering situations"". My hope is that if you listen carefully, you'll be able to avoid some common triggers so that your anger doesn't turn into something unhealthy.


1. Making Someone Feel Uncomfortable / Unable To Do Anything About It (e.g., crying, yelling, getting upset)

If you've ever had to explain yourself to people who don't want you to have an opinion, then this is probably one of those situations where you're likely to receive an uncomfortable response from them - especially if they think you know more than you actually do. If you ask them what makes you upset, they might respond like ""Oh, just...I was being mean."" Sometimes when people feel threatened, they may also express feelings of guilt (""Why didn't you tell me?""), but these aren't necessarily signs of anger. They could simply be responses to stress - which usually begins with having to deal with someone else feeling unsafe around you. Anger isn't often expressed when we're stressed, and in fact, it's most easily triggered when we're under stress or emotional stress, such as during a conversation, or when someone says something that upsets us. Stressful situations cause us to become overwhelmed, and even though our reactions might seem harsh to others, we realize that it's because we were trying to protect ourselves or others. You can imagine how much easier it would be for you if we all reacted to every bad thing that happened instead of letting everything go without saying anything! When we're over-exposed","therapy is a tool that helps to understand, control and/or change behavior. It can be used by parents, doctors, teachers, counselors, social workers, students or anyone who wishes to learn more about how to make the behaviors they want less likely, or how to help them feel better.

The most common form of psychoanalysis is called ""talking therapies."" It involves talking with the patient about their problems and feelings, then developing strategies for dealing with those problems. Psychoanalysis is often used in conjunction with psychotherapy, but it's also useful alone. In fact, there are many different kinds of psychotherapy. The most popular is known as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which focuses on understanding your thoughts and emotions and making changes in them, rather than changing reality itself. CBT may include techniques such as mindfulness meditation, cognitive restructuring, and self-talk. Other types of psychotherapies focus on helping you develop skills to cope with anxiety and depression, and work with you to find out why these things happen to you. These treatments vary from person to person, depending on the type of treatment being provided, what the underlying causes are, and whether the therapist is trained in treating mental disorders or not.


Psychodynamic therapy is another kind of therapy where the goal is to understand the root causes of emotional and behavioral problems. Psychoanalysts think they have found that some people suffer from pathological patterns of thinking and behaving, while others do not. As part of this analysis, the psychologist will talk with the client about his or her problems and try to figure out ways to treat them without hurting someone else. Psychoanalytic techniques like hypnosis or deep breathing are sometimes used along with other approaches.

Meditation, cognitive restructuring, and speech therapy involve trying to bring people up to speed with the way their mind works; the methods they use to think; and ways to manage negative feelings. They're especially important because many people can't tolerate stress and can experience extreme reactions to it. Cognitive therapy is focused on learning new ideas, improving ones we already know, and replacing old bad habits with good ones.

Many therapists specialize in one kind of psychotherapy or another. For instance, some psychiatrists study the psychology of grief and trauma, while others teach people to identify and process anger and fear. Others focus on working with patients with conditions like anxiety, eating disorders, chronic pain, or substance abuse. Many schools now offer special programs for children and teens that incorporate psychotherapy and related classes into curricula"
54,Question: What does multiple sclerosis diagnosis include? What does it change?\nAnswer:,"It includes the following things (as indicated by the word ""or"") when a physician diagnoses MS:

1. The patient is at least 18 years old.

2. There has been an MRI of your brain, spine or cerebrospinal fluid for the past 7 days.

3. You have symptoms that meet all 3 criteria above and that do not match any other medical condition(s).

4. Your doctor recommends treatment with steroids, anti-inflammatory medications, radiation therapy, a surgery to remove part of the spinal cord or lymph node(s), or one of many other treatments. If you are older than age 50, ask your doctor if these therapies may be helpful and discuss whether they would help you regain mobility.

5. The cause of your symptoms is unknown.

6. You have had an aggressive disease during your lifetime, such as cancer or AIDS.

7. This problem cannot be treated without surgery.

8. The mainstay in treating MS is taking steroids, anti-inflammatories and/or radiation therapy to treat the inflammation within your brain. Some people use corticosteroids, which can decrease the amount of oxygen available to your cells. Others use drugs to destroy the microglia cells which create the immune system's response to the disease. In some cases, people use drugs called immunosuppressants to control their own immune systems, especially those involved in regulating blood sugar levels.

9. Any medicines, supplements or dietary changes taken since this point in time will probably affect how well you respond.

10. The primary outcome measure used for diagnosing MS is an objective score on the Multiple Sclerosis Disability Index (MSDI) developed by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (http://www.mssociety.org/). See MSDI page for more information about MSDI.

11. Many patients also take medication for depression, anxiety, migraines, irritable bowel syndrome, allergies and high cholesterol. The benefits from these medications outweigh the risks associated with the pills themselves, so many people choose to keep them on hand.

12. Most women who get MS eventually become pregnant. They should talk with their health care provider before becoming pregnant and before becoming pregnant again. Tell him or her that you or someone close to you has MS and that you want to avoid pregnancy until you know how you will react to a baby.

13. A person diagnosed with MS can expect to live into his 40s.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the brain. It has many symptoms, including muscle weakness and spasticity in the legs or arms, vision loss, hearing problems and dementia. In some cases, MS causes other health issues such as blindness or paralysis.

How often does MS affect me? For most people with MS, their illness lasts between two to seven years of age.

What are the different types of MS? There are three primary categories of MS - primary, secondary and tertiary. Primary MS involves nerve cells that are not destroyed by scar tissue; this type of MS usually occurs after an infection or trauma. Secondary MS is more serious than primary MS, so it typically follows damage from a stroke, car crash, surgery or trauma. Tertiary MS tends to be found in older adults and young children. These diseases involve cell death through myelin sheaths around nerves. Each type of MS has its own characteristic features. Learn more about the differences in these conditions.

Is there treatment for multiple sclerosis? The best way to treat MS is to keep your body healthy by eating a well-balanced diet, exercising regularly and getting enough sleep. If you have any questions about how much time or money you should spend on treatments, talk to your healthcare provider. Some drugs may help prevent or reduce MS symptoms, but they don't cure MS.","In a nutshell, MS is not just one disease or condition. It's an umbrella term for many different conditions, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and fibromyalgia.\r

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that affects the central nervous system. As we all know, inflammation causes damage to cells throughout our body in response to a variety of factors, from infections such as MRSA and H. pylori to environmental toxins and stressors, including poor nutrition, physical exercise, lack of sleep, and over-exposure to light and heat. \r

A lot of research has been done on the role of immune systems and inflammation in this disorder, but there are still some questions about how MS develops and its course.\r

If you have MS or other autoimmune diseases, your doctors may recommend treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs. This will be covered by Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance companies, health savings accounts, and other sources of coverage. You should talk to your doctor about whether these treatments would work best for your situation. If they don't, ask if you can try to find out more information online, at local medical centers, or in person. The American College of Rheumatology provides a list of available resources here.\r

What does Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis Include?\r

In addition to having several symptoms related to multiple sclerosis, people with multiple sclerosis often have additional health problems that affect their quality of life. To help you figure out what type of treatment might work best for you, we've put together an overview of the various types of MS and other complications associated with them, along with the symptoms most common among patients with MS.\r

Types of MS Symptoms\r

Some of the following symptoms are part of the classic MS picture: headaches, fatigue, joint pain, stiffness, loss of balance, numbness and tingling, changes in vision, and trouble walking or feeling tired. Other symptoms may also occur. Some of these symptoms may appear only occasionally; others may develop rapidly and result in permanent disability.\r

Common symptoms related to MS include headache, neck and back pain, muscle aches, dizziness, nausea, depression, weakness, weight gain, depression, sensitivity to light, blurred vision, hearing problems, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty speaking. Sometimes milder symptoms will subside after a few months, while more severe symptoms may persist for years. One symptom that commonly occurs in both men and women is unexplained vaginal","Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the brain, spinal cord and nerves. It is not specific to one area of the body but can affect any part of your body. You do not have to get MS to be diagnosed with the disease. Many people who are affected by multiple sclerosis are not aware they have the disease because of its relatively mild symptoms. The symptoms may be achy or tingling or stiffness in your hands and feet or headaches. Your doctor will need to look at your medical history to figure out what other conditions you had before getting MS. She may also review your current treatment (including medications) and make some adjustments based on this information. If she finds an underlying condition, she'll tell you about these and suggest changes to your treatment plan.

What are the signs and symptoms of MS?\nAffected individuals often experience some form of muscle weakness or numbness. This may range from slight twitching (tingling) in the limbs to complete paralysis. Most common symptoms are fatigue, poor concentration, joint pain, blurred vision, muscle aches or stiffness, loss of balance, problems walking, difficulty speaking and swallowing, and difficulty thinking or sleeping. Sometimes people experience more severe symptoms like depression or hallucinations. People with MS sometimes don't realize they're having the disease until later in their lives. They may be unable to take care of themselves properly, lose jobs or become depressed. Some people develop a rash at different times during their illness. In rare cases, someone who has MS can see things clearly for only seconds before becoming disoriented. Other people notice unusual movements such as eye floaters or double vision. Signs and symptoms usually disappear once the infection clears up. When did MS start? People can suffer from MS for decades without experiencing any symptoms. However, if a person develops a few early symptoms (such as sore eyes), he's likely to get the disease later in life when he starts to exhibit symptoms. The onset date depends on many factors, including where you live, how old you were when the first symptoms began, and whether you lived near doctors who treated MS patients. There have been several theories as to why there might be an increase in MS cases over time. One theory suggests that more women than men develop MS. Another hypothesis claims that women who develop MS have fewer genes related to sexual development. Since women typically have children later than men, some research has suggested that MS increases the risk of being a mother, which might lead to an increased number of new cases. More recent research suggests that people who","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the central nervous system. The symptoms of MS are similar to other forms of brain injury and includes loss of motor control, difficulty swallowing or speaking, difficulty walking, weakness in some muscles, seizures, vision problems, memory issues, and depression. There is no cure for MS but there may be ways to slow down the progression of the disease or treat its signs and symptoms. In addition, there is no definitive way to identify who will develop MS, although several factors seem to contribute to this outcome.

Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis: What does Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis Include?

Some people with MS have severe nerve damage as well as muscle weakness and trouble breathing or swallowing. Other people with MS have only mild nerve damage. Because symptoms vary from person to person, you should seek medical advice about your condition at your earliest available opportunity. However, it's important to know what type of MS you have before going to the doctor.

What Type of MS Does It Affect?

It's not entirely clear how many people experience MS, so each case must be evaluated individually. Most commonly, this form of MS occurs when the nerves surrounding nerve cells become damaged. But other types of MS can result if certain proteins accumulate in the nerve cells. These abnormal proteins cause the nerves to lose their ability to receive signals from other parts of the body. When these proteins build up, they become thick and hard and interfere with normal functions like thinking, feeling, and remembering. These ""myelin"" disorders also affect peripheral nerves that make connections between various parts of the body.

If you're diagnosed with more than one type of MS, the best treatment depends on which nerve cell has been damaged. Some people are able to get better using drugs to prevent further damage to others, while others need surgery to remove damaged nerves. Doctors usually start by looking at the history of your symptoms, including any recent infections or accidents and whether you've had neurological tests such as MRIs and CT scans. If those results suggest an underlying problem, doctors might try treatments to reduce nerve damage. For example, medications like beta-blockers help reduce the amount of white blood cells present in the brain. They increase oxygen delivery to affected areas. This reduces inflammation and helps relieve pain. If you have an autoimmune disorder, you might be treated with another medication called immunosuppressive drugs. Antibodies directed against these antibodies block the production of white blood cells that normally help fight infection and inflammation.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease. It affects the central nervous system and spinal cord, resulting in nerve degeneration and disability. The immune system destroys white blood cells that fight infection and inflammation. These white blood cells also destroy some of the small nerve fibers within the brain called myelin sheaths. This causes pain, weakness, loss of muscle coordination and numbness. For people who have MS, symptoms are often worse than they were before they developed the disease.\r

There are three main types of MS. First, there are primary MS and secondary MS. Primary MS, or relapsing-remitting, involves an attack on one of your nerves or more than one nerve at a time. It's characterized by progressive loss of motor function and sometimes paralysis of the arms and legs. People with this type usually have no other health problems. Second, there are fibromyalgia attacks -- attacks of pain throughout the body -- where a person might develop severe fatigue and loss of feeling around the stomach area. And finally, there is MS unilateralis, which means the disorder results from both sides of the body affected. The most common form of MS is known as relapsing-remitting MS. In this case, you start to experience new symptoms after the first attack. Relapses are more likely during early periods of MS, but you can recover and go about normal life. Most people with relapsing-remitting MS are still able to work and enjoy social activities. They may find that their physical and cognitive abilities gradually improve over the years. \r

All these forms of MS affect different parts of the body. They can be very similar, such as the first type of MS, or they can be quite different. For example, there is also a form of MS that only affects the muscles and bones of the face, neck and back. You cannot feel any movement or strength in those areas, nor can you make use of them for many hours without assistance. As a result, if you have relapsed, the effects of the relapse are often immediate rather than gradual. Symptoms may come and go quickly or last several months. Some people have long-term damage that includes loss of vision, hearing or the ability to walk normally. For others, however, symptoms appear suddenly or persist for months. Many patients with MS suffer from serious medical problems including depression, memory impairment and neurological complications. However, people with MS generally live longer than other people because of fewer complications and better treatments.\r

To","Multiple sclerosis is a disease characterized by inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. It can be defined as an immune system disorder. The name comes from the Latin word ""multiple,"" which means ""many.""\r

A symptom is any physical or mental sign, such as muscle weakness, loss of function, pain in the face, dizziness or nausea that happens when the body's immune systems are activated. There are no symptoms for people who have MS, but many people with MS do not know they have this disease because they don't realize they're suffering from it. This condition affects approximately 1 percent of all Americans. People with MS may experience fatigue, joint problems, vision problems, headaches, joint stiffness or trouble walking, memory loss or concentration issues. They also may have changes in their bowel movements and urine. Some people find that their muscles become stiff and crampy after they move. Others may feel like they have constant pain or numbness. Many patients say their health has improved since they've had treatment. However, some people with MS never recover fully. People with MS often report feeling tired after having treatments, even though they felt fine before getting those treatments. In most cases, the illness doesn't go away completely, but symptoms sometimes improve within two to three years. For more information on MS, visit your healthcare provider if you or someone in your family has been diagnosed with MS. Learn more about autoimmune diseases.\r

What causes multiple sclerosis?\n Answer: There are several theories about what causes MS. A genetic predisposition plays a role in causing this disease. The cause of MS can vary from person to person depending upon a number of factors. These include age, gender, genetics, diet, environmental exposures, medications, and other lifestyle factors. Because there is no cure, prevention is key in preventing MS. To learn more about how to prevent MS, see Preventing MS. To learn more about why certain drugs might increase risk, read Why Drugs May Increase Risk of MS.","The patient's physician will use a medical history, physical examination and laboratory results to determine if the disease is MS. If the doctor suspects the person has MS, they may order an MRI or other tests.

After determining that the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis exists, a specialist in neurology performs a spinal tap for imaging purposes. This test, which looks at brain fluid (spinal fluid) levels, tells doctors more about what's going on inside the person's head than how the disease affects their muscles. However, it doesn't tell them anything about whether the disease might affect the rest of their body. For example, there could be damage to nerves or blood vessels, such as bleeding from a ruptured spleen, and inflammation of the brain (encephalopathy).

Multiple sclerosis can cause symptoms such as headache, fatigue, weakness and numbness in one leg. A nerve injury caused by a stroke could also contribute to muscle pain, weakness and stiffness. Severe depression can make the condition worse. And people with MS who have had recent accidents or injuries might feel fatigued or depressed when they're resting, even though they're doing fine.

If you think you have MS, talk to your doctor right away. He or she can get an evaluation of your symptoms so he or she knows which treatment options are best for you. But first, you should have some testing done to confirm that you have MS.","Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disorder that can affect any part of the body. It affects about 1 in 100 people and causes symptoms such as weakness, numbness, trouble walking or speaking, problems with balance, vision changes and problems with language. It also affects how muscles work. The condition is very different from other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia. \n

What can you do to help someone else who has MS?

Ask your doctor for an appointment with him/her if there is ever an issue regarding mobility, strength, pain relief, appetite control, sensitivity to light or noise, tiredness or headaches. If you or someone you know is having difficulties, get them involved in a support group like the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's MS Support Group for Women. They'll be able to offer information on coping strategies and provide encouragement and assistance. Helping others can mean giving up on yourself so don't give up trying!\n

If you have a friend, family member, co-worker or business partner who has MS or another type of chronic disease then consider offering some kind of financial contribution by donating to a charity such as the American Red Cross or the American Diabetes Association. There are many organizations that will accept donations from individuals, families, businesses and the community and they all work together to make sure everyone gets the help they need.

It causes a loss of muscle control and pain in joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments and other tissues. In some people, it also produces problems with vision, speech or balance. People with MS can be diagnosed with it from time to time because they may experience symptoms. The severity of these symptoms changes as your age increases. For example, if you are aged 50, it might start out being mild, such as joint pain, swelling and an increase in difficulty falling asleep. As you get older, however, things will become more severe and you could develop long-lasting disabilities. If the signs and symptoms worsen or there's no improvement after two months, you should see your doctor. Your GP may refer you for tests (such as MRI scans) to diagnose MS. You should not have any treatment until this test results are known. Some symptoms will improve over time; others may require ongoing treatment. Read more about MS Symptoms and Diagnosis.

Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis – Blood Tests A blood test called an anticoagulant antibody testing (ACAT) is used when you're diagnosed with MS. This test looks at antibodies against a type of protein found on red blood cells. Antibodies against this protein help prevent blood clots. Many people with MS react very badly to their anti-MS antibodies, causing them to bleed easily and experience a range of short term effects including diarrhoea, fatigue, numbness and tingling around the eye and nose, dizziness, sensitivity to light, blurred vision, poor hearing and poor memory. Other symptoms can include headaches, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pains, weakness, skin rashes, depression, fatigue, confusion and anxiety. While many people with MS live normally, others need to take extra care if they do come down with a serious illness like pneumonia or flu. Learn more about Anti-Microbial Therapy (AMT).

Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis - Psychological Testing Anxiety is one of the main triggers for MS. Often people report feeling anxious around someone new or going through a difficult time. They worry about what to say or how they'll look. To help you cope better, a psychological assessment may be done by trained professionals who know more than you think about your symptoms. These tests aim to find out whether you've been diagnosed with a mental health disorder or if you need professional support. These tests can help guide your therapy so it fits into your life best and helps you feel well."
55,Question: How to manage multiple sclerosis?\nAnswer:,"It's just like getting married. You want someone who is willing and able to make the commitment, who you will get along with, who has your best interests at heart.""

The research was published in the journal Neurology on April 9.","It is not that easy. What you need is a good therapist, and more often than not they are someone with MS. So it takes time for you to be able to become the best possible person who can help your patient heal. This can take years, or even decades. Most of us will have to do this on our own, but I am here today to give you some tips. The key is for you to find out what works best for you, and then make sure you're doing all you can to get better.


SOME OF THE TIP SHEETS BELOW WILL HELP YOU LEARN HOW TO DO THIS...

1. Start by getting to know your symptoms: If you can't see anything in specific areas of your brain, and you don't have any symptoms of MS other than fatigue, pain, depression, poor vision or loss of muscle function, you may not be suffering from this disease. There are many things you can try to increase your quality of life if you feel the same way. If you want to go deeper into why you think you might be having these feelings, read my post below titled 'Practical Tips for Managing Multiple Sclerosis Symptoms'.


2. Use a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) technique when dealing with the thoughts of others. For example, use this exercise on yourself. Notice how your mind thinks about things like your doctor, friends, family, work, job and finances, etc. When you notice that there isn't an immediate logical reason as to why something is happening to you, ask yourself questions like ""what do I really need right now?"" or ""why am I feeling this way?"". If you can answer those questions honestly, you may actually be changing the thoughts in your mind, making them easier to change. You can also practice this by using a CBT tool such as this one. Just remember to always tell people who ask you these kinds of questions that you are being honest.


3. Consider the role you play in people's lives. It is very difficult to deal with a disorder that affects everyone so deeply, especially when it impacts your everyday lives. If your spouse or partner has been diagnosed with MS, you might wish to talk about their symptoms with them before you have to go to visit them. It would be helpful to say something along the lines of ""it is hard to watch as you work day after day, knowing how much effort each one of you put in for us"". Or you could suggest having the conversation with a friend rather","The best way is to use a good combination of treatment. For instance, if you have one or more sclerosis, it's likely that the best thing you can do for your condition is to try to keep your symptoms under control by taking medications and doing things like physical therapy. This will reduce your risk of getting another attack by lowering the levels of inflammation in the brain that trigger attacks.

If you have no known autoimmune disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), then most people with MS who need treatments won't respond any better than those without them. However, there are some people who might benefit from this approach, because they have a disease that makes their immune system overreact and produce antibodies against the body's own tissues. This means that even though you don't feel sick, it may take a long time before your symptoms improve. If you suspect that you may be an example of this type, talk to your doctor about whether you should consider changing how much medicine you take or avoiding certain foods.","It depends on the individual and his or her situation.

If you have a severe form of MS, it is probably best to take medication to help your immune system defend against infection. This could be taken as a pill, an injectable gel or a cream. If this is not possible, consider using a nerve stimulator that works by stimulating nerves in the brain. Your doctor can tell you how much, what time and where to get this type of treatment. To avoid making any more trips to the ER, use one of these medications every day and follow it closely for at least 3 weeks after stopping the treatment.

You may also want to ask about other options besides taking medicine. Ask if there are ways to improve your condition such as exercise, nutrition and good sleep habits. Talk with your doctor and take all suggestions into consideration.","First, try to keep the symptoms under control. Then consider the possible side effects of the medicine (including dizziness and memory loss). Then try to find a doctor who specializes in MS and has experience treating the disease.

If you've got the right treatment, it might work well for you. If not, then maybe other methods are in order. For example, if your brain is really injured or damaged at some point, then a new technique may be required. In these cases, a second, more thorough, neurological evaluation may be necessary as the first one could have failed. You can use this same approach with any condition that needs help; it's important that you understand what kind of therapy would best suit your situation and how much time you'll need.

You don't have to get rid of your medications—they're just no longer effective. Your doctor will probably prescribe something else if your body doesn't respond to them in a meaningful way. That could include an electroconvulsive (ECT) machine—a device that causes the patient's head to shake violently, which helps break up the electrical activity in the brain. ECT machines can also help relieve depression. Other treatments may involve drugs or psychotherapy.

The bottom line is that there's no substitute for real-world experience and research. A person's brain has evolved over millions of years and is still very different from our own. We know little about its connections and abilities. But we do know enough to give you options.

Possible Solutions for Multiple Sclerosis

1) Exercise and Diet

For many people who have a history of MS, exercise has proven helpful in managing symptoms and improving function. It is important that you choose exercises that work well for you, as too much or too little exercise can be detrimental to health and progress. Exercise must be balanced to prevent muscle weakness and pain, and to build strength. Ideally, each session should last no longer than 30 minutes. Make sure you include at least 15-30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity three days per week.

2) Immunotherapy

There are numerous immunotherapies available for treating multiple sclerosis, including T cells, cytokines such as interferon and others, steroids, corticosteroids and anti-CD19 antibodies. Each type has different benefits and side effects, so it's best to determine which one works best for you before starting treatment. Some patients prefer to use one approach while other patients will find more effectiveness by combining two approaches.

The following strategies are considered effective treatments for multiple sclerosis; however, some studies do show mixed results and some research suggests there may be additional potential benefits from combination therapies. Keep in mind that many types of immune reactions may interfere with each other and cause an increase in risk of developing autoimmune disease. If your doctors recommend any of these options, make sure they are safe and effective for you.

3) Immunosuppressants

Inflammation, which occurs when certain proteins bind together, causes inflammation and scarring in many inflammatory disorders, especially in MS. A common immunosuppressive therapy is cortisone. Cortisone reduces inflammation and increases blood flow and oxygen supply within the brain, helping reduce muscle spasms and improved movement. However, this drug may decrease the body's ability to produce new nerve endings, making symptoms worse over time. In addition, this drug can lead to serious problems such as blindness. Patients taking cortisone are advised to avoid activities like playing sports, traveling and eating high protein foods.


4) Surgery

Surgery can greatly improve patient outcome with respect to relapses, disability and cognitive decline. Recent studies suggest that surgery alone may significantly slow down the progression of MS symptoms. Therefore, some patients seek surgical intervention when their MS is","You must have a doctor in place who will prescribe the right medication for your condition. They will also tell you about treatments and supplements that can help. Do not skip any steps, but do take this time to learn more about your specific condition.

Ask questions and be prepared to answer them.","I would recommend that everyone with MS seek a ""cure"" or therapy which is designed to eliminate the disease. In this way, all of us will be free from debilitating symptoms and no one will have to live in constant fear of death! The best way to treat multiple sclerosis (MS) today is through immunotherapy, where immune cells are injected into the body to attack the diseased tissues. If you suffer from chronic inflammation, it may take months for your immune system to recover from the first injection, which can often make treatment more painful and uncomfortable than if you had been taking traditional medications. Another approach to treating multiple sclerosis is an integrative approach using natural therapies such as acupuncture, meditation, yoga, etc., so that we do not become dependent on conventional medicine alone.

Q: Do you think that the government should provide a benefit/cost comparison for those who can afford private insurance plans? I am considering enrolling in private insurance but my husband says he does not see how it makes any sense. Is there anything you think about? Answer: There are currently only two publicly funded health programs – Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B. Each program covers roughly $9 billion per year, which means that they each cost approximately $11,000 per person in total annually. This figure includes the costs of covering people with disabilities such as high blood pressure and diabetes, as well as other medical expenses associated with disability (such as hospitalization), but excludes the costs of insuring individuals who choose not to purchase insurance coverage. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that the combined annual expenditures for these programs amount to about $200 billion. Because each of these programs also provides financial support for public services such as home care, child care, education, and social service programs, it is important to consider whether one could pay for these services out of their own pocket without paying into these programs directly. When evaluating the value of various health care options, consider the overall cost of providing health care through either federal or state government funding sources. As with every health care decision, it's important to determine what will most benefit the individual.


Q: What's your opinion about the fact that some doctors don't believe that vaccines cause autism, even though many studies show otherwise?

What is MS?\n Answer: Your immune system attacks white blood cells, called T-cells, that protect your body against infection. The most common type of attack on the brain occurs when a person's own white blood cells are damaged or destroyed. This damage is caused by an autoimmune disorder (an illness in which your body is unable to fight off disease). According to some experts, one in four people have this condition. It can occur at any age but typically starts before the age of 30 and progresses over time. Symptoms include blurred vision and other visual problems. In addition, many patients report memory loss and difficulty concentrating. About 1 out of 4 people with MS have had the disease for 10 years or longer.\n

MS symptoms are different from those seen in other types of autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis or systemic lupus erythematosus. When diagnosed with MS, people usually lose their ability to walk, talk and swallow, but they don't necessarily go into a coma or die. While it doesn't affect daily life, the lack of movement can cause major depression, anxiety, fatigue and other physical problems, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. People with MS are also at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease.\n

The first signs of MS may appear between ages 40 and 60, but sometimes it develops later, often starting around 20. If you or someone you know has MS, talk to your doctor about getting help."
57,Question: multiple sclerosis stages phases\nAnswer:,"I have been asked this question many times and the correct answer is that it depends on your age. You will have a stage, or stage 1 (which is called ""refractory"" by MS specialists). The next stage in MS is stage 2 with the progression of disease into an advanced stage 3, which is almost impossible to cure because of the loss of immune system function due to the immune system attack on the nerve endings. The fourth stage is the last phase where the patient becomes totally paralyzed, but there are ways to survive without any functioning of your nervous system. There are no signs of improvement until you reach stage 4 or 5, when your condition gets more severe.

QUESTION: how much of my blood can be converted into energy? Answer: Your body has a limited amount of oxygen available for use, so it needs additional fuel for energy production. The main source of oxygen for the human body comes from the lungs; however, this system requires additional amounts of oxygen to maintain function. Because of this requirement for extra oxygen, your liver is responsible for converting most of your blood's oxygen-carrying components into usable fuels such as glucose, fatty acids, and proteins. To understand why some tissues require greater levels of oxygen than others, consider the example below. If we're talking about a person who weighs 200 pounds and runs on 1/2 his own weight, he would need about 60% of his body weight each day to carry oxygen around, just to keep his heart beating normally. But if we're talking about someone who weights only 20 pounds but runs on only 10% of his own weight, then he should not need 60% of his body weight each day, since he will get only 8% of all the oxygen needed to run his muscles and keep his heart beating naturally, while burning only 0.8 grams per minute of pure oxygen (a little over half of what he'd burn if he ran at 100% of his body weight). Therefore, he'll need 50% less of his total body weight each day to supply him with enough oxygen to stay alive. This is exactly what happens in type 1 diabetes, where the ability of our cells to pump out sufficient oxygen is impaired. Type 2 diabetes results in lower levels of oxygen consumption in some parts of the body because insulin fails to properly regulate the release of glucose into the bloodstream.","yes, I am a MS patient\r

Response: Yes, you are a MS patient\r

The person who answered the question said they had MS and that he/she was not on medication. They did mention that this is how they feel with other types of illness. The response from my doctor was ""I see lots of patients suffering from these problems and can't tell you how many I've treated."" This is what I would expect from MS patients. However, there has been some research into the effects of medication for MS and some doctors have found that it does help to reduce symptoms. My doctor also told me that she sees lots of patients like you and feels frustrated that they don't have any better results with their medications. She says if someone isn't doing well and doesn't want to take them off their meds, she'll put them in an open-label trial. That means they could be given something in place of their current medications for several months and then have to decide whether or not they want to keep taking it.","There are four stages of MS (in order):

1. Primary disease—primary motor symptoms such as weakness, muscle pain or stiffness, and/or difficulty walking/jumping;

2. Secondary progressive forms—secondary signs that do not affect the primary disease;

3. Progressive partial paralysis—possible progression from progressive to complete paralysis;

4. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy—more severe than the primary disease

The definition of ""primary"" is actually a continuum of signs that may be present during any stage of disease. In fact, some signs like numbness or tingling in limbs may have an effect on the whole body.

There are three main ways that an immune system reacts to this type of infection:

Primary response–this occurs when the patient has antibodies against the parasite, which causes inflammation. It's the most common way to diagnose MS, but it can also appear in other autoimmune conditions. The symptoms include fever, fatigue, diarrhea, joint pains, skin rashes, headache, and more.

Secondary response–the immune system responds by producing cytokines called interleukins, which are proteins produced by cells throughout the body that help keep us healthy. They can cause high blood pressure, dizziness, and even seizures.

Progressive response–a progressive course of disease takes place because the immune system keeps growing until the tissues become so damaged they are unable to fight infection. These conditions include MS. For instance, in patients with moderate or severe chronic relapsing remitting MS, their brain becomes progressively worse over time.

MS symptoms usually come on gradually over years, and many people don't realize that there is anything wrong with them until after they've had a stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, diabetes, cancer, or another serious illness. However, if your MS doesn't respond to other treatments and you're experiencing persistent symptoms, please contact our office right away for a diagnosis and treatment plan.

It is not as simple as that, but it works like this: the cells in your body have some sort of mechanism for recognizing and attacking the invading bacteria or virus and destroying them. The way the immune system reacts will be determined by how well or poorly you are able to recognize and destroy invaders. In fact, there is no single stage of MS. There is also a spectrum of symptoms and severity within different stages, so if someone has all three stages then they may still get treatment with any given drug.

Q: How does my brain affect me? Answer: A person can be affected differently by their environment, but I think most people would agree on one thing – their brains matter just about as much as our hearts, lungs, kidneys, etc. (Yes, I know I am repeating myself, but I'm trying). That being said, we don't necessarily need to worry about how our bodies feel because of this, nor do we need to worry about what goes on inside our heads. When a person's head is healthy, then everything stays healthy. This includes their brain, heart, intestines, blood, skin, muscles, nerves, heart valves, skin lesions, blood vessels, internal organs and more… Your brain is really important because it controls so many functions which include thinking, learning, emotions and even sleep. You might recall that before I wrote this blog post, I had always wondered why my parents were so concerned with having children. They told me when I was very young they didn't want another child. Then I learned their reason was ""it would cause problems."" Now, after reading your answers to this question, I believe they probably felt I should grow up too fast. I guess this is a reasonable concern, though many mothers and fathers say ""if you had only had kids you wouldn't ever have been born."" So I suppose it depends what kind of person you are. If you're like most people, you love and nurture your babies, but you have never actually seen a baby, then maybe that isn't such a great idea. However, if you've lived through a couple of births, then you likely have seen infants at least once in your life, and you will see them again sooner or later. While you are here, take a moment to ponder something: while we are all connected, all biological processes are controlled by the same type of protein called DNA. And since it is your DNA that makes your genes, it doesn't make sense that we could","There are three phases of MS.

1. a) early onset, when the disease is still in its embryonic stage; b) late onset, with progressive damage to nerve cells that may not yet be detectable by conventional imaging; c) long-term progression to full disability.

2. During early MS, there is a very rapid increase in MS severity. This leads some people to ask if their symptoms are related to a more advanced state of MS. A study published in 2014 showed that about 1% of patients who develop early onset MS have progressive MS (pMS). However, most research shows that this is an underestimate of the true number of people affected by pMS and does not represent all cases of early MS or pMS. There is also some evidence showing that the proportion of patients who progress to pMS after diagnosis of MS declines over time.

3. In contrast, the majority of patients diagnosed with long-term progressive MS do not progress to pMS. The rate at which individuals progress to pMS is known as the disability progression index (DPI), and it measures how quickly symptoms worsen over time. While many of the changes seen on MRI during early MS are due to myelin damage, the DPI has been shown to decline sharply at later stages of MS, meaning that progressive MS doesn't usually show up on MRI until much later in the disease. As for the question ""is progressive MS caused by a virus"", this would need to be further studied.

4. It appears that the risk factors for MS remain the same whether someone develops early or late onset MS. People with high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking and obesity also seem to be more likely to develop early onset MS.

5. For those whose symptoms can be managed through medication, treatment of milder forms of MS seems to reduce the incidence of relapse. It's unclear why this might occur. One hypothesis is that MS symptoms tend to improve over time because they're based on earlier damage rather than on a new disease process like relapsing. Another possibility is that there is a genetic component involved. But this remains speculative.

6. Some studies suggest that there is a relationship between inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases, but other researchers don't think this is the case. A study published in 2013 suggested that inflammatory responses might play a role in neurodegeneration. A more recent study has found no such connection.","No, it only goes to stage 3.

Q: How long will I need? Answer: 5-7 years depending on how well you do the treatment. This is why we don't recommend MS medication for a shorter duration. Some people feel better after two or three months of treatment.

Q: I have an immunodeficiency disease and the symptoms are worsening. What should I do? Answer: You can try to get your immune system functioning more normally in order to improve their response to the drug. Also, there might be other reasons that you experience such severe symptoms. For example, your body may not like the medicine being injected into it. If you get a flare up from your medical history, please refer us for help.


You also need to keep doing regular physical exercises, including walking at least 20 minutes every day. This will strengthen your joints, muscles and bones as well as increase circulation and blood flow. Keep in mind that all these steps are recommended by Doctors who know about the condition and have treated it many times before with no problems. There is no specific information as to whether the prescribed medications may make you sick, but it's best to take them according to your doctor's recommendations.

Q: What happens when my treatment is finished? Answer: Your body starts producing antibodies against the active ingredient that was used during the treatment which is what causes your inflammation. So, whenever you start getting new symptoms, your body will reactivate its own defenses and this makes things worse. This is the reason why some patients seem to ""get off"" therapy even though they haven't fully recovered. In fact, most patients just want to go back to normal activity again while trying to recover the effects of the illness.

Q: Where should I keep my pills? Answer: The most effective way to store them is to keep them under the counter so that they don't contaminate food or drink.


If you're looking for alternative remedies, check out our list of Alternative Medicines.","The disease begins with a mild form that usually responds to treatment. But as the disease progresses, severe attacks can occur or the patient may not respond at all.

The symptoms of MS are characterized by difficulty in walking and talking (tremors), numbness and tingling of the hands and feet (myalgias), and fatigue (fatigue-related disorders). They also include weakness, stiffness, spasms, loss of vision and balance problems (myofascial pain syndrome).

If you have MS, it is likely you will develop several types of MS: relapsing-, remitting-, progressive-, or refractory forms. If one of these forms does not improve, the rest of your MS may progress.","A number of different types of patients experience both acute and chronic relapses. Symptoms can also be related to the severity or persistence of symptoms in a particular stage. Some people may experience no clinical signs at all, but it is always important to know about any signs that you are experiencing. If you are not sure whether your symptoms are due to MS or another cause, contact your doctor for more information (for example, if you have experienced an exacerbation or remission).

MS symptomatology: a list of common conditions with potential triggers in persons who have MS (in addition to MS itself)

The symptoms associated with the following conditions may be associated with or triggered by MS:

Anemia

Arthritis

Back pain

Cancer

Chronic fatigue syndrome (myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome)

Heart disease

Hepatic insufficiency

Lupus erythematosus

Multiple sclerosis (mSS)

Metabolic syndrome (diabetes, obesity)

Myalgia

Musculoskeletal disorders

Neurological disorders

Pulmonary diseases

Prevention

There are many ways to prevent MS. For instance, prevention of other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, psoriasis, and systemic lupus erythematosus should be a top priority. There are also many things you can do to reduce inflammation within the body.

Medications

Antibiotics are effective against MS but may interfere with treatment. You can use other medications, including corticosteroids, to treat MS and can also take other approaches to control MS symptoms. These include physical activity, dietary changes, self-care, support groups, and other supportive techniques. Other research shows that using exercise, meditation, acupuncture, and mindfulness therapies, which focus on observing thoughts, feelings, and sensations, might help improve your immune system function.

For those who cannot tolerate antibiotics, there are several treatments available. Many of these involve antiinflammatory drugs and some include oral medications or injections. For those taking medications, the best option will depend upon how well they work. However, if you are going to continue taking the medication, consider carefully before stopping so that the risk of side effects does not outweigh the benefits. Check with your healthcare provider regarding other options if you need to stop treatment.

Prognosis

Mild to moderate","multiple sclerosis is a chronic, relapsing disease that may start as early as childhood and progress into adulthood. There are several different types of MS, including: primary MS; secondary (secondary-onset) or progressive MS; idiopathic MS; multiple sclerosis with focal signs (MSF) and/or disease activity (MDS); and MSD without any disease activity or symptoms.

Multiple Sclerosis Symptoms The majority of people who have a diagnosed diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis have one or more of the following symptoms: fatigue

dizziness

headache

muscle pain

aching in your limbs

difficulty sleeping

frequent urination

swelling in your body

feeling dizzy or lightheaded When you experience these symptoms, it's important to seek medical help immediately because many of them can be serious or even deadly. A person can also develop multiple sclerosis if they've had a stroke and their blood vessels become damaged. In this case, there is no treatment available. Many patients with multiple sclerosis report having trouble walking, swallowing or remembering things. Some people may experience cognitive impairment, vision changes or hearing loss. It's not known which specific areas of the brain are affected by MS but there are some research studies suggesting that an area called the temporal lobe may play a role.


In most cases, symptoms will pass within three months after being treated and many will never need treatment again. If you're concerned about possible side effects from your medication or treatment regimen, talk with your doctor. If you have questions regarding the effectiveness of your treatments, ask your health care provider for advice.","It is possible, but does not mean that it will be the case in every person.

Q: what is the difference between MCS- and MS?

A: The main differences are:

MCS = Multiple Sclerosis stage (MS)

MCS= Multiple Sclerosis stage with relapsing/remitting disease (MRS-D) or persistent disability (MDS)

There is a wide variety of diseases, many different symptoms, and other conditions that can cause severe pain and sometimes paralysis. There may also be neurological problems such as stroke, epilepsy, etc. So there really isn't any ""one"" way to treat MS. However, I do think that if you have experienced one symptom and are feeling better about your situation (for instance, you know when you've had enough, and you're getting ready for a day off from work), then this could be an indication of a good treatment strategy that has worked before."
58,Question: Risk to develop multiple sclerosis\nAnswer:,"No. The risk of developing multiple sclerosis is low and the disease usually responds well to treatment. This answer has been updated in response to a recent review of studies that examined associations between MS, MMR vaccination and neurological sequelae.

Response: The study did not examine whether there was any increased likelihood of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or other neurologic sequelae following the administration of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. There is no published evidence suggesting this association exists, and it may be difficult to prove such an association if there are too few cases and no control groups. As with most diseases associated with MMR, CDC will continue to monitor adverse events.","The risk of MS is low, but the disease can also cause other serious complications. It's important to recognize that MS may be a chronic condition and that it will continue for life; however, you should not treat it as if it were a temporary illness.

Risk factors for developing MS include:

Early age (20-30 years)

Family history of MS

Previous infection with HIV/AIDS or hepatitis C virus

Smoking

Heavy alcohol use

Severe obesity

Other illnesses including cancer and heart disease

When considering treatment options for MS, consider these guidelines when selecting medications.","1/3

Affected individuals have a decreased risk of developing MS (including relapsing-remitting) when compared with the general population.

This study was limited by the small number of participants and the fact that all studies were cross sectional in nature. The results are not conclusive, as there is still a need for larger clinical trials on different populations.

Conclusion : There is no specific risk factor for MS. However, people who drink alcohol may be at an increased risk of developing MS.

Cancer

An association between alcohol consumption and breast cancer has been suggested since 1920, but until recently, it did not prove causal.

In this large prospective study, researchers found that those women who drank more than eight units per week had a 17% higher incidence rate of developing ovarian cancer compared with women who drank less than four drinks daily. However, they said that their study included only one type of cancer, ovarian cancer, and so they cannot say whether there would be any other effect from drinking. They also noted that while their findings could not rule out causation, the sample size of 3800 cases was too small to draw firm conclusions.

Further research into the relationship between alcohol consumption and breast cancer should focus on examining other types of cancers such as prostate, colorectal, stomach, liver, and lung. Also, because the data do not support causality, further epidemiological studies looking at different cancer sites with similar prevalence rates will probably be needed.

Summary : Alcohol consumption appears to increase the likelihood of breast cancer, but further studies are necessary to determine the precise mechanisms through which alcohol might affect mammary tissue. Studies looking specifically at other cancers should be undertaken to confirm or refute these results.","There is no strong evidence that eating red meat or processed meats increases the risk of MS. Research has been limited on this topic, but there do appear to be differences between animals raised in different countries and those raised under similar conditions (see the link below). http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25376797?dopt=AbstractPlus

Q: Is it true that red meat can increase the risk for cardiovascular disease? Answer: It's not necessarily a bad thing that you're getting some extra vitamins from your diet. But it doesn't seem like much of an issue when you consider all the other foods that contain these nutrients. Some studies suggest that a higher intake of saturated fat may actually decrease the number of LDL cholesterol particles. Also, several studies have suggested that people who consume more processed meats tend to have lower levels of HDL cholesterol, which is associated with reduced coronary heart disease risk. So, if you're concerned about your heart health, make sure you're getting enough fiber and protein-rich foods as well. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16144422#page-2

Q: Are there any risks associated with red meat consumption? A study found that high intakes of red meat were linked to increased mortality in men. The researchers said they did not know whether the link was caused by red meat itself or how many calories are in the food. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2917757/?tool=pubmed&list_uids=24954727&anatom=12453499&partnerID=8Y0P9ZK8W6EKG5B4KLX0E7JL7D1V2A1R3F2

Q: Do people who eat lots of red meat live longer than those who don't? One hypothesis about why red meat might increase mortality is because high levels of homocysteine—a chemical that disrupts cellular function—are found in large amounts in red meat products. This hypothesis is supported by recent research showing that individuals consuming the most red meat tend to be older than those who consume less red meat. http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2864320

Q: What about vegetarian diets? Answer: Some vegetarians also take supplements containing vitamin B-","Low. It is possible, but the risk of developing it is low. The rate of onset is about 25% in women and 20-25% in men with a family history or disease prior to any sexual activity. A woman who has had many partners may have a higher risk for development than others.

What is MS?

MS (myelin disorder) is an autoimmune condition that damages brain cells and causes progressive loss of nerve cell connections between nerves. There are two types of MS — relapsing and remitting; you must either be diagnosed as having both type of MS or if you do not have both types, your disease is classified as primary progressive MS (PPS). MS symptoms generally begin within three weeks after infection by virus, bacteria, or parasites. Most people with MS experience at least one flare of the disease every year. You should always talk with a health care provider before getting pregnant.

Misdiagnosis of MS can lead to serious consequences including disability, vision loss, difficulty walking, memory problems, and decreased ability to speak. If you suspect MS, you will probably need to see a doctor early so he or she can check for other conditions like high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes. In addition, you may want to consider getting tested for HIV. Many sexually active young adults with MS experience a rebound period following pregnancy. If you're pregnant and infected with HIV, you should get tested and treated right away!

When Is it Okay To Have Sex Again With Your Partner After Having An STD/STI?

Having sex while you've been exposed to an STD or STI can increase your chances for transmitting them. However, because there's no evidence that this increases your chance of spreading HIV, it's perfectly safe to reexamine a relationship if you were previously HIV positive.

Although it is extremely difficult to accurately estimate how likely you are to spread disease from someone who was HIV negative during their lifetime, it is much less risky to have sex with someone who used to be HIV positive. Research shows that a person who was HIV negative is 10 times more likely to catch HIV in the next 30 days than a person who was HIV positive. So even though the odds of catching HIV in the future are lower, there's still a small likelihood of becoming infected from a long time ago.

If a partner you know has recently become infected with HIV, then you don't have to worry too much about being exposed again. But if they haven't yet passed on","You are at very high risk of developing MS, however it is not a life threatening condition. Some people may experience symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, problems with concentration and memory (visual hallucinations) and/or joint pain but these could be due to other causes.

What is the prognosis for Multiple Sclerosis?

The prognosis for your own health is far more important than the prognosis you get from having another's disease. It will vary depending on the type and severity of the condition, where you live, what you do for work, if you have any family or close friends who are affected by the disease, etc. The main factors that determine the prognosis include: age, gender, blood types, ethnicity, history of medical conditions, ability to take medication and how active you are in the treatment program.

There is no specific set prognosis that has been established yet. The best advice I can give you is this; keep yourself healthy and active. If you have problems controlling your body weight, exercising regularly, taking supplements and consuming certain foods, consult an endocrinologist and dietitian before doing anything drastic. Don't wait until you feel like you are dying to address these issues. If you need treatment to treat your medical condition, talk to your doctor about whether there might be something that can help.

I have MS and have found several websites that discuss ways you can stop the progression of my illness and improve my quality of life. What should I read first?

For people with multiple sclerosis (MS), it is not known whether stopping all medications will prevent the onset of multiple sclerosis. This is because there is currently no way to tell whether medications used to manage MS will make their way into the bloodstream, especially when they come off-label.

If your symptoms continue after stopping all medications, it is highly likely that you will have serious complications resulting from prolonged use of these medications. In addition, patients with MS often require additional care beyond their regular medicine regimen, including psychological counseling.

In some cases, people have started using ""off label"" drugs without consulting their doctors. For example, one well-known drug that was approved for MS, natalizumab, is now being prescribed to treat Crohn's Disease in patients already receiving immunosuppressant chemotherapy. The side effects of natalizumab are similar to those of the current standard of care treatment for MS, so it is unlikely that patients would receive the same benefits. Also, many medications","A large number of recent studies have demonstrated that patients with MS who do not take aspirin, which is the most commonly prescribed prophylactic treatment for this disease, are at an increased risk for developing a second-degree stroke.

However, because other medical conditions often predispose people to strokes, these findings may be more specific to patients with MS than those with other diseases. Therefore, when evaluating the risks associated with aspirin use in patients with MS or any other condition, physicians should ask about other medications and lifestyle factors as well.

What are some alternatives?

Some individuals will find it difficult to tolerate the drug and avoid taking it altogether, but if you're looking for another option to prevent heart attack, stroke or vascular death, there are several options available.

Consider getting blood tests to check your cholesterol levels or test for signs of hypertension before starting to take aspirin. The American Heart Association recommends daily doses of 300 milligrams (mg) or less of aspirin to lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol. This type of medication also lowers blood pressure and helps protect against stroke. People with high blood pressure should also be advised to consider avoiding alcohol consumption. High amounts of sodium can lead to low platelet counts. Also, high levels of triglycerides can cause fatty deposits around artery walls that can trigger a stroke. Another alternative involves avoiding food containing excessive amounts of saturated fat. Although there's no evidence linking saturated fats to stroke, they are known to increase the risk of certain types of atherosclerosis, which leads to heart attacks. In addition, dietary guidelines recommend limiting animal products such as meat, eggs and dairy products.

There are many other drugs on the market that might help reduce risk for heart disease in the long run. These include statins, beta blockers like warfarin or simvastatin (Silberfloxacin), ACE inhibitors and statin drugs such as Crestor or Lipitor.","There is no increased risk of developing MS from sexual activity.

For more information, please see the following article : Sex and Multiple Sclerosis - A Review and Update on Current Research: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=sex+and+multiple-sclerosis

Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), gonorrhoea, human papillomavirus (HPV), genital warts, human chlamydia, HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis, trichomoniasis, and other STDs are much less common in sexually active men than in women. These conditions have been found to be associated with a reduced risk for several STDs (e.g., HPV infection). Although these findings do not necessarily imply that all infections caused by bacteria or viruses are equally important causes of STDs, it does suggest that certain bacterial or viral species are more likely to cause disease than others. For example, HSV-2 is thought to increase the risk of acquisition of some types of anal and oral cancers by about 10-15% (Aguilar et al., 2002; Mireles et al., 1999; O'Rourke, 1999). However, this conclusion can only be made based on epidemiologic data. It should also be kept in mind that there is a considerable amount of debate regarding the association between HSV-1 and other STIs. While HSV-1 has been shown to increase the risk of cervical cancer, its relationship to infection with genital herpes is still controversial. This is especially true when considering the fact that genital ulcerative lesions are commonly mistaken for genital warts. Thus, the best available evidence indicates that the benefits of routine screening for HSV-2 may vary depending upon whether you consider genital ulcers to be genital warts (i.e., ""hysterical"" lesions that appear on an individual's genitals), or genital warts that represent genital inflammation (i.e., ""noninflammatory"" lesions that don't affect external genitalia).

Another condition associated with decreased risk for many STDs involves sexual intercourse during pregnancy, which may have implications for both health and pregnancy outcomes. As discussed above, most studies show that exposure to HIV or syphilis increases the risk of miscarriage. According to one study, when a woman was infected with both HIV and syphilis simultaneously she had a 30% higher probability of having a miscarriage (O'R","0.

Q: Should I get the vaccine? Answer: No. The safety and efficacy of the influenza vaccine has not been established. Some patients experience serious adverse reactions after vaccination and should seek medical attention immediately. Vaccination is a good idea if you or someone in your family will be at high risk for complications from the flu. However, it is important that everyone else with these risks also receive this vaccine; however, there are no specific precautions necessary for those who do not have other health conditions. It is unknown whether the vaccine would prevent all cases of the disease.

Medical Disclaimer","Yes, the risk is very high. It's much higher than other diseases which are more common. However, it can be prevented by getting regular physical activity.

[0080] The risk of developing multiple sclerosis has been estimated to be between 10% and 20%. There have been studies that show an increased risk of development of multiple sclerosis in children who participated in vigorous physical activity or sports as early as 5 years of age.1-3

The risk is particularly low for women of childbearing age because their health tends to deteriorate over time.4 Women with MS also tend to be older and live longer, so their risk may increase when they give birth.5,6 For men, there has been a decrease in incidence among middle aged and elderly individuals.7,8 As a result, people in this group may face an increased risk if they engage in frequent physical activity.9 A study found that those who engaged in recreational activities had a 30% lower chance of developing MS.10

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) affects one in five adults worldwide, but rates fluctuate widely according to geographic region.11 In America, MS accounts for about 2 percent of all new cases; in Europe, approximately 4 percent of all new cases occur.12 Other estimates suggest that MS may affect 1 million Americans each year.13

While the exact cause of MS remains unknown, many researchers believe that environmental factors play a role in its progression.14-16 These include changes in diet, cigarette smoke, vitamin D deficiency, and genetic susceptibility.17 Multiple sclerosis occurs after the immune system destroys healthy cells or causes them to turn against themselves.18 It is thought that environmental factors, such as oxidative stress caused by certain chemicals, promote the process by which these damaged cells destroy surrounding healthy cells.19,20

Several dietary factors appear to be associated with an increased risk of MS. Low levels of intake of omega 3 fatty acids are considered to be one factor contributing to MS.21 Low levels of cholesterol may contribute to MS by increasing inflammation.22 Dietary fiber, which is often overlooked, may reduce the risk of MS.23 The fiber in red meat lowers blood pressure; the same holds true for white meats.24 Fruits and vegetables contain soluble fibers that help regulate the absorption of vitamins and minerals.25 Finally, some research indicates that gluten intolerance decreases insulin sensitivity and may lead to a greater amount of plaque build up on nerve endings in MS patients.26

If someone has been diagnosed with MS before they are 65 years of age, do they still qualify for Medicare?

Yes, people who were diagnosed with MS at some point before their 65th birthday can receive Medicare based upon a determination made by a physician. This determination is called ""diagnostic criteria."" If the doctor finds that there is a specific set of symptoms or signs associated with MS that is present during life, then Medicare will pay for these benefits until the patient reaches 65 years of age and turns 60 years old. Additionally, those who qualify under Medicaid must meet the same standards as Medicare recipients.

This includes vaccinations for measles, mumps, rubella and polio. Learn more about how to choose which vaccines are right for your child on our Vaccine Page.

Are pregnant women at increased risk for developing a chronic illness like Multiple Sclerosis?

Pregnancy comes with many risks including early delivery, infection, and complications arising from childbirth. Even though pregnancy poses few problems","We believe that MS is a degenerative disorder, and while there may be some short-term benefits of exercise training on brain function, this is not sufficient to make the practice an effective treatment for MS. The research findings indicate no statistically significant improvement in cognitive function or motor function. It does not appear that physical activity will enhance quality of life, as measured by subjective well-being, disability, or health status (i.e., pain scores), nor it appears to improve function. There are no long-term studies which have looked at long term effects of long duration exercise training.

What do you think?.","A systematic review of the available evidence by four experts in this field found that while there is a very strong link between short and long term use of anticoagulants, the strongest evidence points towards no longer having an impact. The most recent review from 2002 by the UK's National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) found 'there is insufficient evidence to conclude that these drugs have a causal role' on multiple sclerosis development. However, they did note that there was considerable 'overlap among studies'. One possible explanation could be that different groups of patients with MS received different levels of anticoagulation, leading them to take different amounts at one point or another.[6]

Response: As I understand it, there are two types of data. Some research has shown an association between higher blood levels of coagulant agents and a later onset of progressive disease; others show no association. This means we can't say for sure which type of data is more reliable. There also is some doubt about the actual benefits of using anticoagulants; there seems to be an assumption that people who have been previously treated with high doses will benefit more from lower doses, even though the evidence indicates otherwise. Other researchers suggest that anticoagulation may actually cause other adverse consequences such as kidney damage, bleeding disorders, and gastrointestinal problems.

Response: There's plenty of literature to support the theory that chronic use of antiplatelet therapy worsens the risk of stroke, but I wouldn't call it 'proven' evidence yet. In 2004, some doctors tried to claim that regular daily aspirin use reduced the risks of stroke and heart attacks. It turns out that a large study published just last year didn't support the idea that frequent aspirin usage led to decreased risk of death or strokes.[7]

So far there hasn't been any hard scientific evidence to prove that taking an extra dose of anticoagulants every day harms your health. But it does seem like the possibility should be investigated further.

Response: While there isn't hard evidence that using anticoagulants prolongs life, there doesn't appear to be much harm done either way. Most studies indicate that patients taking anticoagulants are healthier than those not taking them. This suggests that some combination of anticoagulating factors may protect against the development of many common diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer.

Conclusion

There really aren't any solid proof-of-concept studies regarding how much anticoagulation medications affect your","yes.

[Top of page]","there is no evidence to suggest that a vitamin B12 deficiency causes MS. Vitamin B12 can be found in foods and supplements as well as from supplements, but it has not been shown to cause the symptoms of MS.

vitamin D deficiency and MS\nAnswer: vitamin D is an essential nutrient for the body and is produced primarily by our skin cells. As with many vitamins, the amount you need will depend on your weight and activity level. In general, people who are overweight or active should aim to get sufficient amounts of this important mineral. People who are less active may have lower requirements than those who are more active. For example, individuals with normal levels of calcium in their bones should receive at least 600 international units (IU) daily; those with low calcium levels, such as those with osteopenia and osteoporosis, may require significantly higher doses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advises taking 1,000 IU daily of vitamin D for children between 6 months and 2 years of age. However, these guidelines do not apply to pregnant women or lactating mothers. Research suggests that women who take birth control pills should be cautious when they supplement with vitamin D because their bodies may produce too much. It is also best to consult with your health care provider before starting a regimen of oral vitamin D supplementation for adults.","yes.

Long-Term Effects and Risk for Multiple Sclerosis

Multiple Sclerosis is a disease that results in an immune disorder that affects a person's ability to regulate his or her body's immune system. The body's immune system fights off diseases such as cancer, viral infections, infectious diseases, bacterial infections, influenza, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B/C, arthritis, Parkinson's disease and AIDS. It also attacks tissues such as the brain and spinal cord, causing these tissues to malfunction, or atrophy. The damage caused by multiple sclerosis occurs on a cellular level, meaning it does not occur at one point but rather over time (in the context of the disease). This leads to chronic inflammation, which can lead to neurological complications. These symptoms include joint pain, numbness, tingling and other sensations associated with peripheral neuropathy, including headaches, depression, memory loss, difficulty concentrating, fatigue and even blindness. Neurological issues can be severe enough that people who have them may need medical attention. For example, patients may find that their cognitive functions are reduced and they may require a wheelchair due to muscle weakness or paralysis. There can be no cure for this type of disability.","not yet, but it's a possibility. It could lead to some kind of damage or dysfunction in certain brain areas and it may be possible that you have a genetic predisposition to MS.

Q: if it is true, what other options are there?

A: You have two options to address this issue. One option would be treatment with an antibody called interferon beta1a (IFN-beta1a), which blocks the inflammatory response caused by the disease. Another option would be to go under general anesthesia for several days. Anesthesiology is one of the most well-studied medical procedures, so I think the evidence behind this is pretty strong. However, it does require a great deal of commitment from your doctor, because once they know that you're going into surgery, that's when their attention shifts to the next patient. They might feel pressured at all times to get you out on time or to give the procedure just enough time to pass. So the only way I can see this being feasible in the near future is if you'd get the operation within 6 months after diagnosis. If you were able to go into an operating room within 3 weeks of diagnosis then you wouldn't have to worry about the anesthesia or being rushed through.

I don't see any downside to having to go under general anesthesia. You really shouldn't be going into surgery unless there's a serious reason, like if you've had your appendix removed or something else.","the effect on the immune system is small and does not appear to be related to treatment. Question: what about cancer?\n

Answer: a number of studies have been done showing that patients with MS are less likely to develop chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in response to chemotherapy than those without MS, but this study was short-lived and has not yet been replicated in larger cohorts. There is also no evidence that low levels of TNF-alpha will cause problems for people who have high levels of it. The best advice would be to limit exposure to TNF-alpha through medications such as corticosteroids or immunosuppressants such as aspirin, which can lower blood TNF-α levels.[13] It may also help to avoid taking medicines containing histamine, particularly in older adults or children, and use antihistamines if possible, especially if you have had an allergic reaction or experience any other symptoms.

The good news is that even if your immune system is impaired there are ways to make it stronger and fight off infections - especially for chronic conditions such as type 1 diabetes, asthma or arthritis. You should still seek medical attention when you notice changes in your symptoms, for example loss of appetite or weight gain, or unexplained vaginal discharge. If you suspect you have a viral infection such as herpes simplex virus infection (HSV), you need to get tested immediately. For others, such as HIV infection, you'll want to talk to your doctor.","yes.

Q: What is the treatment for Multiple Sclerosis?


A: The most important treatment to fight this disease is lifestyle, and a variety of diets are available.

There are several kinds of diets that can help in fighting MS. However, there are no proven treatments or cures yet.

62,"Question: disclosing multiple sclerosis at work, how will colleagues react?\nAnswer:","This is a question I am not able to answer. The only thing that would be useful in this case would be if you could provide some sort of an abstract or a paper summarizing your experience so that my colleagues can learn more about the disease and what it has done to your life. It's also worth mentioning that people who are taking multiple sclerosis medications have sometimes been observed by their workplace medical staff to get sicker than normal patients with MS. However, I don't think anyone who works with patients who are on medication for MS actually knows anything about it (it is hard to tell them apart from other people). People do, however, often notice subtle changes in patients who take multiple sclerosis medicines. For example, when someone takes multiple sclerosis medicine they might suddenly develop a rash. So maybe that person's rashes were caused by the drug itself, rather than because of any underlying illness, such as allergies, which causes similar symptoms, especially around the time when the drug was given. That being said, there may be some cases where these problems occur even without treatment of the disease. There is no way of knowing. In addition, as one of many factors involved, workers and managers may feel uncomfortable talking about this topic with people who they consider to be family members. Also, this issue doesn't usually cause much angst among employers, since most employers allow employees to discuss personal health matters publicly. Still, it would be good to know more about the possibility of problems caused by multiple sclerosis drugs.

Q: What is your opinion regarding MS as a cause of infertility?\nAnswer: This is a very difficult question to answer, since I had never seen one before. And although I saw several references online, none seemed to describe exactly what I had read about MS causing infertility. Some suggested that women suffering from MS would become infertile due to a drop in the number of sperm produced. Others thought that the drop in numbers of sperm would result in the loss of sex hormones and thus the failure to conceive. The problem here is that there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support either of those claims. To begin with, let me state that while it is true that women suffer from MS, I doubt that they would give birth to babies during a period when MS was present. A woman's body does not produce enough sperm to compensate for the lack of semen. Secondly, the claim that women diagnosed with MS cannot conceive children, well, it just isn't true. Yes, MS sufferers can conceive children with only partial assistance from their bodies","Most people think of MS as a disease that affects only those who are actively living. It's actually more than just someone with MS. People diagnosed with other conditions can be affected in the same way and even suffer from similar symptoms to MS. The fact that there is no cure for MS means that there is an increased risk of developing other conditions related to it. For example, you may develop arthritis or other health problems after years of use. If your employer discloses this information at work, it could cause some people to avoid using certain products for fear of exposure to the disease-causing chemicals that might still be in their bodies. What if I have a chronic condition such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or asthma?\n

What do I do about this disclosure when I become aware of it during my job interview? In most cases, employers will require the candidates to make an oral disclosure before they get hired. Some companies also allow employees to sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) which prohibit them from discussing or even mentioning any relevant facts. In these cases, the employer should ensure that this nondisclosure agreement doesn't interfere with any employment relationship or make it impossible to meet performance goals.","If I had disclosed my disease to my supervisor in the workplace and he then said, ""OK let's talk about this,"" or ""What should we do about it?"" that would have been fine. The point is to discuss issues with coworkers. It might be useful for me to tell my supervisor about a potential medical problem but not disclose what ailment that may cause and to be careful not to make that disclosure public so as not to create problems for myself. However, if my co-worker has told other people about the condition (and not just his colleagues) then I could reveal that I also have MS. Or if I'm in a position where I need to speak up more than one person, such as when talking to HR or corporate leadership, then I can disclose all of them. In any case, I recommend seeking professional advice regarding this issue.

This is an excellent question from a patient who has had severe pain since age 9. She asked us about some things that she learned while working at a major pharmaceutical company. We wrote her a note about what we found useful and helpful, and included our thoughts on how we can get help. We are pleased that we helped her to understand better about MS. Her notes below include links to information on treatment options and resources for patients with MS.

Dear Ms. Schafer:

I recently went through a difficult period during which my body began to fail me. After five weeks, I was admitted to the hospital, given morphine, and given 10 days to live. During these days, I developed extreme muscle weakness, and in addition, I experienced frequent and excruciating pain. I was in pain every single day; at times I would literally sit down and cry. My body could no longer function. There were no doctors available to assist me in managing my pain. To add insult to injury, I discovered that I couldn't even eat because there was nothing left to digest. When I was admitted to the ICU, the doctor instructed me that if I could not eat within 5 days, they would begin to administer morphine. Unfortunately, my husband became ill shortly after that and had to go into surgery immediately. Since then, my weight has dropped precipitously; I have lost 30 pounds since being discharged from the hospital and am now down to 180 pounds.

On Monday afternoon of January 7th, 2016, I decided to take matters into my own hands by having my boyfriend drive me home from work. When he arrived, I knew something wasn't right. My stomach felt","You can disclose MS symptoms to coworkers in a number of ways. Most important is always letting your boss know about the condition and asking that they give you a ""no"" for any duties or privileges you may need. If your boss doesn't know, don't worry; it's just one of those things that people should talk about. For example, if you're working on a project with someone who has MS, you might ask him or her to stop work so you can catch up on the disease.

If your boss does not know, then all he or she needs to do is say something like this: ""I've heard several reports that you have MS, but I think you should go home for a few days and we'll figure out what to do."" If you don't let them know, chances are they won't be too upset; they may even appreciate the offer! And if they do come to you before you leave, make sure to tell them that they're welcome back whenever they want. Remember, this is an illness — there is no easy cure.","if the person is a doctor or research scientist then I suppose they would be ok with it. If someone who does not do research is asking about MS and wants to know more info that's fine too!\n

If you are having difficulty finding information on this page please contact us (please make sure your question includes a link to our site).","I have not yet had to disclose my MS to anyone but I do know that when people see me with the disease they may be surprised. This is because there are so many things about my life that require secrecy. First of all, I'm an employee of a large national company and as such I must be very careful about what information I make public, especially if it relates to my job performance or my private lives. Second, in addition to being part of our company, I am also one of its most valued employees. I am expected to maintain an exemplary professional record and report directly to management. Third, I need to keep my personal life completely private. When I start feeling depressed or anxious, I can't go into a meeting without someone asking where I am. As I mentioned earlier, these kinds of questions could really bother some folks in my team; however, I don't mind this attention since it is necessary for my health and well-being. 4/19/2010 Q&A: I would like to know whether I might benefit from taking medication to manage my symptoms.\nAnswer: In general, the best treatment option for MS remains ongoing disability management. However, it's important to note that you should consult your doctor before initiating any form of medication therapy. For example, you shouldn't use medications to treat pain until after a patient has been diagnosed. Also, you should not assume that anything prescribed by a medical provider applies to other people. The physician who provides care for you will want to speak with you about your specific situation. If you decide to seek help from a healthcare provider, remember that the individual treating you will likely recommend different options than those recommended by your physician. Although some medications have been found to reduce or eliminate the symptom of MS in patients with mild to moderate MS, other medications may provide benefits to other patients, particularly those with active or worsening MS. 5/3/2010 Q&A: My mother died of MS. What does my husband think? Answer: My wife and I discussed her passing and thought we'd share our thoughts here. We both feel strongly that my mother's death was preventable. Both of us had heard of the importance of doing something now to address MS. Our thoughts were that we could never fully understand the severity of MS if we did nothing. That said, we hope that we helped in some small way to assist others facing similar problems. We believe that by sharing our experiences with others who have faced the same challenges we've experienced, we will have helped them achieve greater freedom","it depends on whether you have a good relationship with your boss. If your boss is not interested in seeing the progress of your condition, and if you do not feel that you can get much better without medical assistance, then just keep working. You will continue to suffer as long as you are unable to take time off from work for treatment. However, there are some ways you can use for your workplace to improve their attitude toward MS patients. 1) Make yourself available to work, even during non-working hours. You can ask your boss or supervisor when they might be willing to come into your office and talk about something personal related to MS, such as a family member's death or an ongoing illness (for example, when you go through a period where you feel ill). 2) Try to make sure that your health insurance covers all forms of disability benefits. This includes any medications you receive and other treatments, including physical therapy and occupational therapy. 3) Look into getting professional help, and if possible find someone who has experience treating people with MS to discuss options. 4) Ask your bosses and supervisors to provide support as best as possible for you while you're dealing with this disease. They may be able to offer advice like scheduling appointments, providing referrals, making suggestions for effective communication between you and your doctor and more. 5) Be careful not to let negative stereotypes affect your approach to treating people with MS, because most of us tend to treat others with respect instead of scorn (see the interview below). It would also be helpful if you could avoid speaking negatively about people with MS by avoiding using words like ""crazy"" and ""mentally retarded."" 6) In case you decide to seek out medical care, check the guidelines of state Medicaid programs and Medicaid offices about coverage. If you have questions about treatment, see our Treatment Guide.

[1] A number of studies have shown a link between a lower BMI and higher prevalence of MS, but many other factors appear to influence MS risk. For a review of current research on both obesity and MS, see The Diabetes Solution.","I have already been told that some people are very hostile to me. But it's not just me. In the past few years, I've had one coworker who was on the autism spectrum and another who had a condition similar to MS who also worked in management roles. I am sure that everyone knows about these issues but it took them awhile to come out with their opinions and concerns because they didn't want to get involved or hurt someone else's feelings. This is what I am dealing with now. How can I help you more?

ANSWER: You should first seek professional help for yourself before seeking medical attention for your symptoms. See my article entitled ""Cognitive Behavioral Therapy For Multiple Sclerosis"" for tips on how to obtain the best results from CBT. My personal experience has taught me that when a person feels they have nothing more they can do to improve their situation, they usually stop taking action. Often times this is a sign of depression or suicidal thoughts.

Answers to other commonly asked questions:

Q: What if I don't like the way my MS looks? Is there anything I could change?

A: Yes. It would be nice if you felt comfortable wearing an outfit that doesn't show too much skin, and you'd look good doing so! That being said, many patients find themselves wishing they could go back to normal everyday life as soon as possible (i.e., dress like a student again). To remedy this problem you may wish to try wearing pants to school/work and wearing a T-shirt at home. If you're still uncomfortable, you might consider having your doctor make changes to your current regimen in hopes of improving your comfort level. Alternatively, you could take medication such as steroids or oral antibiotics to reduce swelling in the affected area. A quick Google search will turn up several articles which detail ways to decrease inflammation in MS.

Q: Why did I develop MS?

A: The exact cause of MS has yet to be determined, but there are a number of factors thought to play a part including genetics, age, environmental toxins, disease, and stress. The combination of all these factors causes varying degrees of severity, depending upon the individual. There is no single cure for MS. All therapies aim to manage the symptoms and promote recovery by removing any remaining triggers causing the problems. Some medications used to treat MS include rituximab (Avonex), atenolol (Advil), celecoxib (Celebrex), and cycl","it's just another day in the office for me! I know there are some who might be concerned about my having multiple sclerosis and they should not. The disease has been treated with medication that does a great job of controlling symptoms, including pain and swelling, but those medications have side effects; people need to make their own decisions based on what works best for them. My biggest fear is for others to worry if they notice changes in my physical condition or my speech, and this would cause them to stop working with me. So please do not let anyone worry too much about your medical history. I am confident in my ability to handle any situation and will continue to work as long as I can, although I may eventually require less disability benefits than before. It really doesn't matter because you will never feel like an outsider to our workplace.

63,Question: Will multiple sclerosis affect my career?\nAnswer:,"No. Multiple sclerosis is a very serious and debilitating disease that affects the nervous system, including the brain. People with MS are at risk for developing other disorders such as Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease. If you have a history of MS or other diseases that might make your life more difficult, please see our Patient Information page.

Q: What if I have an autoimmune disorder such as lupus erythematosus (LY) and/or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)?\nA: Your doctor may test you to determine if there is a connection between your condition and another medical condition. In most cases, an initial physical exam will check for any symptoms of a specific illness.

If your diagnosis includes lupus or SLE, it is important to note the following:

The immune system cannot fight off all types of viruses or bacteria that cause lupus, so your body fights them off. You can develop both lupus and SLE through viral infection; however, some people do not experience these symptoms until they start having recurrent viral infections in their lifetime.

Most people who get LY have mild symptoms. However, others may still be able to function well despite having severe lupus-like symptoms such as fatigue, pain, joint pains, muscle weakness and joint stiffness.


Lyme disease and associated problems can occur even without a first diagnosis of lupus. For example, people with Lyme disease (chronic borreliosis), which also causes the same symptoms, often don't realize that their body isn't treating lupus properly. They could develop the same complications as people who have MS but who aren't diagnosed until later in life because they hadn't realized they had lupus yet.

People who were never infected by an animal should take precautions to prevent getting sick from animals, especially ticks. Tick bites are usually painful and can spread illness to humans and sometimes animals. Therefore, tick protection products must be worn when outdoors and use insect repellents such as DEET when outside.

Some people have no signs or symptoms. These are referred to as ""incidence"" or ""asymptomatic."" Some people have no symptoms at all. Most cases are underdiagnosed and undiagnosed. This means many people go untreated.","No, I do not expect to lose any of the support and opportunities that a good job affords. However, with so many people out there suffering from MS, I am trying to find ways for me to be at the forefront of getting it cured, while also being involved in other areas of research.

Q: What are you working on now? A: The first project is an attempt to synthesize stem cells, which could lead to new treatments. For one thing, they would allow for better detection of patients who have relapsed. Another is developing a treatment for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). I'm also researching immune-cell therapies, because my wife suffers from multiple sclerosis and her own cancer, so she wants us to help the world. The last project will eventually involve creating genetic tests for blood types to identify those with various diseases. Q: How do you spend your days? A: My work time consists mainly of writing, but I make sure to take some time off when needed. Most mornings I walk around the neighborhood or down to the store. Evening hours are spent watching sports games or catching up on the news. It's not unusual for me to stay up until 3am playing video games. At night, I enjoy reading books or movies, and occasionally going to bed early. I can be found anywhere on campus and on the interwebs. Q: Where was college your major? A: UMass Amherst and University of Massachusetts Amherst are where I received my bachelor's degree in 2004. Before I started working as a writer, I worked full time as an information technology consultant in IT/communications. After school, I took several courses during summer break and then attended two years of nursing school in California, receiving my masters in 2010. Q: Do you plan to finish your education? A: Yes. Though I've completed my undergraduate degrees and currently have no plans to graduate with a master's degree, I want to continue learning about all aspects of healthcare science. That way, if I choose to pursue another career path, I'll be able to contribute to the field more than ever before. I believe that this knowledge will benefit society greatly.","I'm not sure. Most doctors say they know nothing about MS and think that people with it are just ""sick."" But if you go to a neurologist, the odds of hearing from her is really good.

Q: What does an MRI tell me?\nIn a nutshell, the most recent MRI is always the best indication of what's going on in your brain. When you get a new MR, you'll be told which part(s) are damaged and why (by looking at them). If there are any unusual abnormalities, such as strokes or cancer, you might want to see an endocrinologist or neurologist first before deciding on surgery. You don't have to take anything off; the doctor will be able to give you a list of options.

Q: Should I keep track of my progress during treatment? \nThe latest diagnostic test can help determine whether you're progressing well enough for surgery. Just remember: no matter how much you improve, you won't have control over your health forever. It's important to make every effort to keep yourself active, but you'll never feel completely healthy. This is true even when you've made remarkable gains in terms of strength and function. At times, it may seem like you're getting better because your body seems to work more efficiently and more effectively, but this doesn't mean your brain and nervous system is functioning better than usual. The fact that you're getting better means that your pain levels and symptoms aren't improving (they're staying the same), so you should stay vigilant about monitoring your condition. In some cases, the treatment itself may make things worse instead of better. Also, as mentioned above, if you're starting to experience side effects from the medication prescribed, you might consider having someone else monitor you while you use drugs that could worsen your situation.

Q: How can I avoid being pressured into getting surgery? Does surgery hurt too much? \nIf you're worried about having surgery after reading this book, then read Dr. Fink's article on ""How Not to Get Surgical"" first. He explains the risks, risks, and benefits of each operation, so you don't need to worry about complications until you start thinking about what's best for you.","If you have MS, it will not cause you to lose your job. The law provides that, if a person becomes disabled after the age of 65, they cannot be discharged from their employment until they are deemed ""fit for work."" As a result, no one should be surprised or discouraged by this fact. There is currently little research on how the disease affects careers but there may be some long-term consequences. Many people with MS go back and forth between jobs, often in high demand positions. In addition, the disease can become so severe that patients must remain hospitalized for months at a time. This means an employer might find it difficult to keep up with the demands of an employee who has been off sick for several years. Finally, even though the disease can have debilitating effects, many doctors view MS as merely a chronic illness, not a disability. Although there is much more study on this subject, the outlook for people with MS is positive. According to the National MS Society's website, ""[a]ll individuals with active MS report improved functioning,"" and their overall health is generally good. Many people with MS manage to maintain a normal work schedule without having to take time off due to their condition. People diagnosed with MS tend to see significant improvements in the quality of life associated with their conditions. This includes their ability to function effectively, live independently, and attend school.

CASE STUDY: What happens when I return from treatment?\r

Case Study: A young woman had her first major stroke at age 40. She was admitted to the hospital with a headache, numbness, tingling, and weakness. During initial evaluation, she stated that her husband worked for a large international chemical company. Her symptoms persisted into adulthood, and after leaving the hospital she returned to her family home and eventually found herself unemployed. She then sought assistance through a community program that provided services such as nursing care and occupational therapy. After five years, she began taking daily aspirin. Over time her symptoms diminished significantly and she now works full-time as a nurse. While her symptoms did not resolve, her physician believes that her strokes caused by her first stroke recurred during her second stroke. Although she continues to experience fatigue and headaches occasionally, she feels she is able to fulfill her goals and wishes to continue working.

COMMENTS: The above case illustrates a number of potential outcomes associated with the brain injury that occurs following a cerebral contusion. Although an individual's response varies from one patient to another, the most common outcome seems to be improvement","It is possible that multiple sclerosis may negatively impact your career, but you should be aware of this possibility and discuss it with a health care provider. Your medical history and symptoms may also play a role in determining the likelihood of developing MS.

There are several studies which demonstrate an association between chronic stress and a greater risk for development of multiple sclerosis, including one study in which patients were divided into groups based on their levels of psychological distress at baseline. Those who reported higher levels of stress experienced longer duration of disease progression. In another study, individuals who had more frequent physical activity during their lifetime were less likely to develop MS than those whose level of stress was low. Stressful events and social isolation can cause the immune system to overreact and produce autoimmune diseases such as MS, however. There are many factors that influence whether or not MS develops, and some have been shown to increase the risk of MS. These include genetic predisposition (for example, hereditary polymorphisms), lifestyle habits (smoking, poor nutrition, alcohol use, obesity, poor sleep quality) and environmental exposures (such as toxins from cell phones). While these factors all contribute to the overall incidence of MS, the exact contribution varies greatly by individual. For example, the following studies have found that women with a family history of MS experience an increased odds ratio of developing MS if they smoke cigarettes daily, while men without a family history of MS do not. Some other research has revealed that people with autoimmune disease (such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, Crohn's disease or type 1 diabetes) exhibit a lower risk of developing MS when exposed to certain foods, like peanuts and wheat germ. Finally, there appears to be a positive correlation between being obese and having an increased risk of MS. The American Heart Association states that it is well established that obesity increases the risk for hypertension and heart attacks. Obesity is also associated with elevated triglycerides and the incidence of diabetes mellitus. Therefore, it might be prudent to consider dieting as part of your treatment program.

When considering a diagnosis of MS, it is important to remember that most cases of the condition don't progress beyond mild disability. However, if your doctor suspects that your symptoms are due to the onset of MS, he or she will be able to provide you with specific advice about how to manage your condition. This information will help you prevent relapse, treat any exacerbations and reduce the severity of your MS symptoms.","Absolutely, and in some ways it may even change your life. If you are an MS patient or know someone who is, the best way to help will be to get involved with a study that is being conducted at Johns Hopkins University. The reason for this study is to look into the possibility of using new techniques to treat MS patients by targeting different parts of their bodies instead of just one location, such as the brain. This could mean treatment changes in everything from walking to speech to eating, which would make living with MS much more comfortable for those affected. The results of the research should help answer these questions and help shape future treatments.

© Jordan A. Sutter, Ph.D.","Multiple sclerosis affects all people, but the disease is most common in women. You may need to take extra time off from work during your treatment or you might have an increased risk of a disability claim. There are other conditions that can cause this type of injury and it's not uncommon for the person with MS to experience other health issues as well. In any case, having MS should not be considered ""normal"" or ""unusual"".

How Can I Tell If My MS Is Bad?

Once a diagnosis has been made about you and your MS, doctors will begin making plans. Your doctor will tell you if there's anything he/she wants to do to help improve your condition (such as taking medication), if there's something they're worried about (like surgery) and how long you'll need to stay in the hospital before you get better. They'll also ask you questions such as: How many years have you had MS?

Have you ever lost more than 25% of your blood volume due to MS?

Are you willing to talk to your surgeon?

What kinds of medications will you need for your disease?

What types of treatments will you want to use?

If you have children or grandchildren, will they care for them?

Will you be able to work at the same level or above when you're fully recovered?

Does the loss of one limb make you feel sad? Or does the loss of one limb make you laugh?

Do you know what type of exercise you'd like to do after getting back into work? When you recover? And even more important, how much money would you be willing to pay to keep working? Some people who have MS will try to explain their situation to the doctor to see how comfortable he/she is being honest. They might say, ""I've always thought of myself as different, but I couldn't stand up straight without a cane."" While the information that the doctor receives might seem unusual, it's normal for everyone else in their position to have similar feelings. The only way to really know the answer to these questions is by talking to another doctor – sometimes the doctor can give you a list of questions the doctor expects patients to answer for themselves. These are some typical questions asked by someone with MS: What kind of medicine do you usually take every day?

When did you first notice symptoms? What was their severity?

How often do you have numbness, tingling, weakness or muscle pain?","Yes, but only if you are actively seeking a position as a physician.

Is it possible that this is what I have been experiencing for a long time with numerous physicians and the number of medical school graduates who were subsequently diagnosed with MS has gone up dramatically in the last 10 years? There's absolutely no way to know unless we get more data.","Yes, multiple sclerosis may cause disability. For example, if you have symptoms of MS that include pain or weakness in one side of the body and numbness on the other side of the body, this could be a sign of multiple sclerosis. It is very important to get medical tests (such as X-rays) and follow up with your doctor for the best possible treatment option.

Q: What are some other causes of disability from MS?\nIf you think you might have MS, talk to your doctor about finding out what's causing it or why it affects you.","No, it's an entirely different disease. Your doctor should be able to tell you that if you have MS, and you don't feel well.\r

Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis \r

What is MS?\r

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a progressive form of multiple sclerosis that affects approximately 1 in 200 people worldwide, affecting some 2 million individuals. The exact number of cases has been estimated by MS Society International since 2000, but estimates vary widely because only a small fraction of people with MS actually get MS. With time, however, many cases of MS can lead to disability or even death, as seen with patients like former NBA player Yao Ming, who was diagnosed with MS three years ago. When someone develops MS, symptoms appear at least five days after starting treatment; they become worse with time and can last up to two years. Even though MS is not curable, most people can expect their condition to improve over time. People with MS often live longer than average without developing significant disability; however, for those individuals who do develop MS, disability typically lasts between 3-5 years. It's important to remember that this means that if someone has MS at age 60, the chance of them being disabled before 65 years old increases to about 5%. However, if you're 55 and still have moderate or severe symptoms, you could potentially end up having lifelong disabilities and even die before you reach middle age!\r

Symptoms of MS include pain, numbness or tingling in one hand or foot, fatigue, muscle weakness or loss, joint or nerve aches, vision problems, hearing problems, cognitive issues, depression, and memory lapses. Treatment generally consists of medications such as oral anti-inflammatory drugs and NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents), oral corticosteroids, immunosuppressants (such as steroids and chemotherapy medication), and sometimes surgery. The duration of treatment depends upon the severity of the symptoms. The treatments themselves can differ depending on the type of MS. The majority of MS sufferers have no symptoms of any sort"

Q: How much do treatments cost?\nA: Treatment for MS costs around $15,000 per year for a standard course of treatment. Additional fees such as insurance premiums or medications vary widely by region and state, but often start at just over $20,000 annually. It's important to note that treatment does not always result in remission, nor should there be any expectation that your condition will go away completely. You will still need follow up care and appropriate rehabilitation after you've completed your treatment program if necessary.

Question: In a car accident, does the police officer who pulled over actually stop to check out the damage or just let you off the hook? Answer: No","I have several, but the most common is my right arm getting very stiff. It's been known for years that there are many different types of MS and that these ""symptoms"" can be a result of many different things going on at once - the muscle fibers in your hand or arm don't just get stiff, they get worse over time.

Answer: The best way to tell if you have multiple sclerosis (MS) is by looking for stiffness in your hands and arms. This condition can affect your hand, arm, leg and shoulder muscles. Often it will take longer than 2 weeks before the muscles start to feel better. You may notice how stiff your hand is after 10 days without pain or swelling. If this is happening then you probably have multiple sclerosis. To determine whether you've got MS, use the standard symptom test.


What causes Multiple Sclerosis?

Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease - meaning it's caused by a virus (or bacteria), either naturally-occurring, like pneumonia or strep throat, or introduced through vaccines. While the exact cause isn't known, researchers think the same genetic and epigenetic factors cause each person with MS to develop the immune system disorder differently. Some people do well without any type of treatment and others need help managing their illness. There aren't too many diagnostic tests available for MS, however there are some important ones we can look at to help us make sure we're dealing with the real deal.

What are the signs and symptoms of multiple sclerosis?


Signs and Symptoms

Here's some of what might be involved when MS strikes.

Pain, weakness and numbness in one or both hands or feet (called ipsilateral iritis) - This usually occurs after infection, trauma or surgery.

The fingers become excessively weak and soft.

Blisters form on your skin.

Tenderness and redness appear around the mouth, nose or eyes

Swelling forms on certain areas of the body such as ankles, knees, hips and thighs.

Aching in your lower back, groin and shoulders.

When to see a doctor about MS

You should consult your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following conditions:


Sudden loss of ability to move your arms or legs

Abdominal pain (abdominitis)

Migraine headaches

Nausea and vomiting

Severe headache

Difficulty swallowing

Loss of","""The main problem is pain.

""People with MS can be very sensitive to their own pain, and in the past many people who had this condition were treated by doctors to make them feel better. This could have led to unnecessary surgery or worse. The new treatment is more targeted at finding the cause of a person's pain.""

-Bridget Wright, MS Support Group member.

Q: What is the difference between MS and Lou Gehrig's Disease? A: MS is an autoimmune disease which causes inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects the nerve cells in the brain. People with MS can't control their body's inflammatory response but they do manage it. When they need to live longer than usual, they may require help from other parts of their immune system. Lou Gehrig's is another form of MS, which involves the destruction of part or all of the small blood vessels in the brain. They are called meningiomas, and in some cases, they lead to paralysis. Other conditions related to the damage to these blood vessels include glaucoma, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, spina bifida, cerebral palsy, and spondylolysis, among others. Both MS and Lou Gehrig's affect different parts of the body and have varying degrees of severity depending on how severe you're feeling.


Q: My friend was diagnosed recently with MS and her doctor says she won't ever walk again! How will my friends cope with this diagnosis? A: It's important for everyone to understand what is going through your mind before making any decisions about your health. You might want to talk to someone else first if possible. Read our article on Managing Anxiety about MS. Q: Why does my family think I'm crazy when I tell them I've been diagnosed with MS? Do I even deserve to know? A: This isn't unusual. There is no cure for MS and most patients still face significant challenges after diagnosis. Your family is entitled to hold you accountable for the information you share with them, and support you throughout the process. Ask your doctor and anyone else with whom you work to let you know what questions they would ask as you begin treatment. If they don't have answers, they should explain why to you and offer suggestions for further investigation. Also be sure to learn how to respond appropriately to questions regarding your symptoms and medical history and the treatments being offered to treat your MS. Learn more here.","The following list is a list of commonly experienced symptoms associated with MS, but there are many other possible causes for these symptoms, and not all of them will be present in every patient. Some patients may experience a combination of symptoms, or none at all. Symptoms that have been listed here include fatigue (not just feeling tired), headaches, neck stiffness, joint pain, depression, loss of appetite, and more. While it's important to recognize the importance of each symptom as an individual case, sometimes they aren't all associated with the same underlying cause, so you can learn about their potential triggers and make your own diagnosis based on your clinical findings. When looking at a patient who has specific, chronic symptoms, you should look for any evidence of MS activity in the patient or his/her family members. If MS activity is suspected, ask if this person is currently taking medications to treat the condition and whether he/she has ever had a medical examination by a doctor with a neurologist specialty. For example, some people with MS may become ""dysfunctional"" without any treatment at all due to medication side effects or changes in lifestyle. Ask to see any tests done by a neurologist who specializes in MS. In addition, check out the following article on MS from the Mayo Clinic, which details what testing might be needed to find the underlying cause of MS and determine the best course of action.

How common are MS symptoms?

Symptoms are different depending upon the severity of the disease. If you're having difficulty concentrating, thinking clearly, walking long distances, or making decisions, you may not be having trouble with physical activities or social interactions, but you are likely experiencing significant impairment in functioning.

It may help to think of the MS symptoms in terms of 3 levels of severity, ranging from mild to severe. A level 1 problem usually won't result in much impact on daily life, but it could take longer than usual to recover completely. It also depends upon how seriously or severely the symptoms affect your ability to work, study, care for yourself, or perform basic functions such as dressing yourself or bathing. You may need additional assistance with tasks that require mental alertness. Your day-to-day living should remain normal, even though you're being treated for a serious illness.

The next level of severity is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, including:

Level 1 problems usually start in the early 20s, but they typically don't occur until age 50 or older. These symptoms include memory loss, problems remembering","Most MS symptoms can be easily differentiated with the help of a simple questionnaire. 1) The person experiences difficulty sleeping, which may lead to fatigue 2) They have difficulty concentrating/concentrating 3) It is difficult for them to read or write 4) They cannot eat or drink 5) They feel tired/sick 6) When they are lying down they get dizzy 7) They see flashing lights 8) Their eyes become irritated/painful 9) The patient feels tired 10) When they sleep it becomes harder and harder to fall asleep 11) They start feeling hungry 12) In some cases they experience changes in their physical appearance 13) They cannot sleep 14) A lot of other symptoms 15) Other symptoms such as nausea 16) Can they walk 17) Do you believe that this particular symptom might be due to multiple sclerosis? Answer: Yes 17) Many people who are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis claim there are no specific symptoms, only repetitive movements or tingling sensations that do not match any known condition. 18) Some people also claim that no one has ever made any claims about the cause of these symptoms. 19) There are some patients with multiple sclerosis who state that they know what causes multiple sclerosis. 20) If you had multiple sclerosis when you were younger did you have pain on your arms or legs? 21) Have you ever noticed unusual physical changes at work or school during your lifetime? 22) Did you ever notice strange thoughts before your first MS diagnosis? 23) Do you think that there is something special about having multiple sclerosis?

Q: What is the difference between acute and chronic MS?\nAnswer: Chronic MS is characterized by multiple episodes that are triggered by an immune response to a particular antigen. Acute MS may be caused by another disease process or by environmental factors like pollution. In either case, there is no cure for chronic MS.

Q: How many people have it each year in the U.S.?\nAnswer: At least one million Americans suffer from at least one form of MS. Some estimates suggest as many as four million people in this country had their first episode of MS within the past two decades.[20] Most cases occur before age 25 years. The incidence of MS varies widely across the United States and around the world. Some evidence suggests a higher prevalence in certain areas than others.[21][22] As the number of people with MS continues to increase in the United States, the overall burden will continue to grow. Many individuals with MS experience serious health problems such as blindness, paralysis, loss of bodily function, and other life-threatening complications. While current treatments for MS prevent these illnesses, treatment can also result in long-term disability or even death. There are currently over 100 medications on the market for treating MS, but most are prescribed off-label for use in combination with other therapies. Additional research is needed into newer drug targets for inhibiting the inflammatory response, controlling inflammation, and improving neuroprotection. These findings could lead to new drugs that target specific pathways involved in the development of diseases including MS. There has been limited research conducted on using gene therapy to treat MS. Current data indicate that some forms of the disease may respond better to gene therapy compared to non-genetic approaches. However, the potential benefits of gene therapy are still uncertain and must be evaluated carefully.[23]

Q: Can genetic testing help determine my risk for developing MS?\nAnswer: Genetic testing does not predict whether you develop MS. While genes are believed to play a role in MS pathogenesis, they do not provide any specific information about whether your risk will go up or down based on your genotype.

72,Question: Is the Covid-19 vaccine safe for people taking multiple sclerosis drugs?\nAnswer:,"No, it is not. In fact, in most cases, the vaccine itself can cause the symptoms of MS and other autoimmune diseases. The CDC has a list of side effects from the vaccination. If you have an autoimmune disease or if your doctor prescribes you medicines that affect your immune system, ask them about these side effects and see what they recommend before you get vaccinated.\nIf you know of anyone who has been affected by the vaccine and wants to tell us their story, please contact me at catherine@catholicbloggers.com. Thank you!

Last updated on March 7, 2013","Yes, it is effective. The vaccine is also available in generic form without the high price tag of a licensed product. This means that if you are on an MS drug and want to buy the Covid-19 vaccine or another one which contains a similar antigen, you can get them at very low prices from local pharmacies.

What does this mean for patients with other autoimmune diseases besides MS (such as lupus)?

The answer depends on whether the disease involved affects only the CNS or also involves all body systems. If the disease involves the entire body system, then your immune system will be weakened by using both corticosteroids and anti-inflammatory agents. This may result in an increased risk for infections and adverse reactions. On the other hand, in the case of autoimmune diseases that affect just a specific part of the nervous system – such as lupus, where there is no central nervous system involvement whatsoever, then your immune system will still benefit from the immunosuppressive drugs provided by the manufacturer, which is why the vaccines contain an additional component called Cefotaxime, which blocks the binding of certain proteins to the receptors, thus preventing the production of antibodies which would target the brain and spinal cord. For those cases where the entire CNS is affected, however, the vaccines provide no additional protection since they do not block the normal functioning of the immune system. Therefore, the vaccines should not be considered as alternative treatment options for the treatment of any autoimmune diseases.

Do you need to take the injections every day during treatment?

No, the injections are given once daily throughout treatment. However, if you are concerned about your health, make sure that you follow up with your doctor before starting therapy so that he/she knows how much you have been injected. In addition, check with your insurance provider regarding reimbursement of these treatments.

What are the risks associated with the vaccination process?

There are many possible side effects related to the vaccinations, including allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis and hepatitis B. Most commonly, the injection is given via a needle or capsule (often referred to as a shot). If you experience problems after receiving the shots, consult your doctor immediately and seek medical attention. A recent study found that 30% of patients who received the vaccine developed post-immunization syndrome (PIS) within six months post immunization. People who develop PIS tend to suffer from fatigue and headaches. Additionally, some studies suggest that the virus could be transmitted to others through the saliva of","The Covid-19 vaccine is not a treatment for MS. It should be used by medical professionals as an adjuvant in patients who have multiple sclerosis. There are no side effects related to the vaccine, except that some children may experience fatigue and/or weakness (fever).

The Covid-19 vaccine does not protect against the disease in those with MS who already take a drug called Atripla, which inhibits cell division and increases the risk of developing the disease. However, many children can safely receive the vaccine without this medication because their immune systems will work well enough without it. If you're considering getting your child vaccinated, you'll need to talk to her primary care provider about the risks of taking two or more medications at once.","The Covid vaccine is a small molecule that stimulates an immune response. It's possible to have an adverse event with this vaccine. People can experience a severe allergy reaction called anaphylaxis, and they may also develop an autoimmune disorder known as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which can lead to long term disability or death.

If you're thinking about getting the Covid vaccine, talk to your doctor first.


How much do these vaccines cost?

Covid Vaccine Prices are based on a dose of one of two vials (2 doses) of vaccine. For example, if you get three doses in total from the CDC vaccine program, the cheapest dose would be $7; the most expensive would be $25. The best value vaccine will be available at the lowest price. The prices shown here are per-dose amounts only, not per vaccine. You must check your local healthcare provider before receiving any vaccines due to the potential risk of contracting diseases with unknown viruses.

There are different types of vaccines available by the CDC: DTaP, DT, Hepatitis A, Hib, Meningococcal (MenB), Polio, Rotavirus, Sulfadoxine and Tetanus/Diphtheria/Tetanus.

When you go to the doctor for a flu shot, there may be a slight difference between what the doctor prescribes and the actual cost.


What else should I know about vaccines?

Vaccines are used to prevent disease, but they cannot cure it. They work by blocking a person's ability to make antibodies against specific pathogens. In many cases, you'll need to receive several vaccinations to fully protect yourself from certain illnesses. Some common ones include measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and chicken pox.

Other recommended vaccines for children include hepatitis B, tetanus and diphtheria/pertussis (whooping cough).","Yes. The FDA has approved a dose of Covid-19 for treatment in multiple sclerosis and is currently reviewing other investigational vaccines. However, this vaccine does not protect against HIV infection and may increase your risk of developing some cancers, including lung cancer.\n

How do I get it?

You can get a full schedule by calling 1-800-947-6226 or visiting http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedule.htm. If you are pregnant, ask your healthcare provider if you should get an HPV (human papillomavirus) shot. In general, women who have had more than one cervical cancer must avoid getting the Gardasil vaccine because they could be at increased risk of certain cancers. You also need to talk with your health care provider about any conditions that might make vaccination unnecessary. See Vaccine Information for additional information on possible risks and benefits associated with HPV vaccinations.

Can I get it when I'm old enough to get the older vaccines (Flu shots)?

No, the Flu shots are required only if you were born before Jan. 1, 2000. For children under age 18, flu shots are no longer recommended because there's been no evidence showing their effectiveness. Parents will still have to discuss with their doctor whether to obtain them. \n","The Covid-19 vaccine is not associated with any serious adverse events in patients taking MS medications. In fact, most of these reported adverse reactions are mild and transient.[5]

What does this mean for parents who choose to vaccinate their children against a common disease? How should parents interpret information about safety and efficacy from different vaccines?

Vaccines may have different responses to the same illness or condition if they are given at the same time by different people. For example, some vaccinations can cause nausea when given to one person. Other vaccines that are similar in structure but differ in how they are administered might also cause nausea in certain individuals (for example, flu vaccines). In addition, different types of vaccines may be able to produce different results depending on whether they are given as monovalent or polyvalent vaccines, which means that there might be differences between them even among the same vaccine type. Because of these concerns, manufacturers should consider giving individualized instructions for vaccination based on the symptoms experienced by each individual before administering a particular vaccine. Some other examples include:

The influenza vaccine contains an adjuvant, such as aluminum hydroxide. Although a significant amount of aluminum was removed during manufacturing, the risk of severe side effects remains. Thus, it is important to check with your health care provider before getting the influenza vaccine because you may be at increased risk for complications.

Learn More About CDC Vaccine Research","No. The antivaccine movement is a fraud and its members are liars, including Andrew Wakefield, who did not perform any research on vaccines during his time as head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), an agency that studies how viruses affect humans.\r


In addition to failing to conduct actual research into vaccines or vaccines in general, the antivaccination movement also does a poor job of communicating their position on vaccines. For example, they have spent more than $20 million trying to discredit the MMR vaccination because of claims that it causes autism, even though there is no evidence to support this claim and even if it were true, there would be absolutely nothing wrong with having the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccine administered to children at ages 7 months through 12 years to prevent diseases such as chickenpox (chicken pox). This approach is very common among antivaccinationists and is known as ""cherry picking,"" which means going after one group of cases and ignoring other groups or issues due to political or financial reasons.\r


Another way to look at what happens when you stop vaccinating your child is by comparing those who do not get vaccinated to those who do. In 2015, there were approximately 616,000 unvaccinated Americans aged 13 years or older and about 11 percent of them had been previously diagnosed with some form of childhood illness. These illnesses include allergic rhinitis, eczema, asthma, and hay fever.\r


Of these children, nearly 80 percent had never received a single dose of vaccine, the CDC reports. \r


There is good news! While the number of unvaccinated children has increased slightly since 2014 (from 518,800 to 531,500) there are still millions of kids out there who will benefit from a healthy dose of vaccinations -- especially given that the majority of vaccines don't work, according to the Mayo Clinic.


What do you think? Do you believe that getting the MMR vaccine can cause autism? Or that the MMR vaccine should only be used for certain types of diseases? Share your thoughts below.","No, it does not. The drug was originally developed to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a cancer of bone marrow cells that develops in patients with MS. When you take CML medicines or receive injections, your immune system attacks some of your body's cells and prevents them from working properly, leading to severe disability and even death. So if you're on one or more CML drugs like glatiramer acetate (GPA) or cyclophosphamide (CyPh), or have had other diseases caused by their use, the disease may be worsened by the corticosteroid medicine. Because the drug is so effective against this cancer, many doctors prescribe it to all those who are taking these treatments and believe its benefits outweigh any potential risks.\nOne study published in the Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology found that over two years, patients treated with Covid-19 had significantly worse outcomes than those receiving placebo. Also, patients given the drug were also less likely to develop an infection, such as MRSA or fungal infections. In another study of 30 patients, 10 of whom received CML chemotherapy, and 7 of whom received placebo treatment, researchers did find that those who took the drug experienced mild side effects such as headache, fatigue and nausea. But there wasn't enough data to draw conclusions about long-term safety.\nAnother study of 21 patients with relapsing-remitting MS found that both the active and placebo groups lost at least 5% of muscle mass during therapy. And there was no difference between the two groups in how quickly the loss occurred. However, none of these symptoms would necessarily lead to serious medical problems, according to the FDA, which regulates drugs used to treat MS. \nA recent study showed that patients who got the medication before they developed progressive spasticity (aka ""spasticity"") suffered far fewer side effects and had better recovery after surgery compared to those whose pills arrived later. \nAccording to a 2004 article in the British Medical Journal, the FDA decided to approve the corticosteroid agent for new uses only after concluding that the drug doesn't cause muscle pain or stiffness when taken alone, but it can worsen the condition. It also stated that ""no additional medical information has been identified regarding the risk associated with taking CCT."" The agency said that because ""there is currently no evidence to support the clinical application"" of the drug, it will continue to review the matter. \nIn fact, it didn't stop there. Another report published in 2008","Yes. The vaccine is safe and effective in patients who have received a combination of MS medications, as well as those who are receiving no treatment at all. The vaccine has been shown to be protective against the development of disease (such as relapsing remitting or inflammatory demyelinating diseases) within 12 months after vaccination. However, this protection may not last beyond six months. As with any type of immunization, there are risks associated with certain side effects, including serious infection and death from infection. Therefore, it's important to discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor before deciding if you're ready to receive the vaccine.


Q: Do I need more than one dose to protect my children from getting MS? Answer: No. Although a single dose is necessary to provide adequate immunity, multiple doses can also help prevent transmission between siblings. For example, an individual infected by an adult with MS would likely benefit from several additional doses because he or she could still get sick from contact with a sibling who did not receive the shot. In addition, multiple doses may reduce the amount of time it takes for symptoms such as pain, fever, fatigue, joint swelling and tenderness to appear.


Q: Can you give me a copy of the current recommended schedule of vaccinations? Answer: We encourage parents to find out which vaccines they should bring their children for first aid training and then obtain additional copies when needed. You can print these materials from www.immunize.gov/vaccination/pages/recommended_schedule.htm. The CDC recommends that every child receive two doses of the MMRV vaccine on average during childhood (4-6 years old). If you'd like to learn more about vaccines available in your area or order them online, please visit the Vaccines & More section of our website at www.immunize.gov.


Q: My children are receiving shots. What should I do? Answer: When preparing a vaccine list, make sure each item is covered by insurance so that both families have equal access to the same schedule. While we understand that some parents are concerned about vaccinating their newborns without medical supervision, it is generally best to use your insurer's policy before you decide to vaccinate. Be aware that you may be required to pay extra fees for the ""unnecessary"" shots given to your baby. Most health plans will cover all items listed on the recommended schedules but plan to charge higher prices based upon your personal situation. Make sure you choose the correct insurance plan for your family size"
77,Question: How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?\nAnswer:,"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease. Symptoms vary from person to person, and are not the same for everyone. Many people with MS also have other neurological problems like headaches or vision loss. Some women may experience menstrual pain, which can be a sign of MS. Women who take oral contraceptives (OCs) during their cycles, however, will likely feel better after starting OCSs in the third trimester.

What happens when you get MS?

Multiple sclerosis affects your brain and spinal cord, so it's important to know about what happens before you develop the signs and symptoms that are common among those who have the disease. The following information comes directly from research done by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). This section discusses some of the early signs and symptoms of MS, including: What causes MS?

Some doctors recommend keeping a diary for 1 year after a stroke because these injuries often follow strokes. However, others say keeping a diary might not provide enough information to diagnose MS correctly. A good rule of thumb is to keep a daily journal of your symptoms for 1 week after any acute stroke. You can review your journal every 2 weeks. Your journal should include all of the following items: Physical exam; Blood tests; Psychological exam; Coma","Women with MS tend to have a higher incidence of mood and anxiety disorders, lower cognitive function, difficulty in socializing, and more disability. In addition, women with MS are at greater risk for depression, which may be exacerbated by the loss of estrogen.

What is the risk for postmenopausal depression in women who are at high risk of developing MS? There are no studies that show a link between estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) or estrogen-progestin combination therapy and depression. However, there is evidence that ERT and progestins can cause a decrease in mental health; therefore, if you take ERT or progestins as part of treatment for MS, it's important to talk about any changes in your behavior or thoughts because this could increase your risk of developing depression. If you're considering taking an estrogen supplement, it's important to discuss with your doctor whether these supplements should be taken while on MS medications like corticosteroids or insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). For example, when starting your first medication, you'll want to make sure you get enough of estrogen before getting off the medication so the hormone doesn't interfere with your treatment. Some other examples of treatments include exercise, nutritional counseling, and psychotherapy. Menopause symptoms, including amenorrhea or premenstrual syndrome, are common among women with MS but there is not much research available regarding their relationship to different forms of therapy such as estrogen replacement therapy or progesterone-only contraceptives (such as the birth control pill or intrauterine device [IUD]). To learn more about how to better manage menopause symptoms, please see our section on Managing Menopause Symptoms.

Are there any specific tests that can help diagnose MS? Yes. Currently there aren't many tests that identify people who have MS. The most commonly used test today is an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan. This type of MRI scans a person's brain using special images made from magnetic fields. MRI imaging shows abnormalities associated with various diseases and conditions. A detailed description of each test is given below: Brain Tumor Detection Test – this test measures the size of a tumor in the person's brain. It may also look at whether the cancer has spread beyond the area where it was found and what drugs were used to treat it.

– this test measures the size of a tumor in the person's brain. It may also look at whether the cancer has spread beyond the area where it was found and what drugs","The two are not related, because the symptoms of MS differ in severity. If one is more severe than the other, then it may be difficult for a woman with MS or women who have MS to get and maintain an appointment with their neurologist. In addition, women with MS typically experience worse moods and greater emotional distress than those without MS; thus, they can often suffer from depression and poor well-being that interfere with participation in MS care.

Q: What is the best method of preventing recurrence of my autoimmune disease after treatment with an immunotherapy drug? \nAnswer: A study published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) shows that the most effective prevention strategy against recurrent MS recurrences involves adherence to a regimen of immune-suppressing medications including drugs such as interferon beta and human papillomavirus (HPV). At least three months prior to initiating therapy, women should be screened for serologic evidence of active MS according to a validated protocol. Women treated with interferon beta are recommended to take this medication on a daily basis until at least 3 months after stopping treatment if they remain healthy. HPV has also been shown to prevent recurrence of various autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis. Patients diagnosed with HIV infection should continue taking this medication during treatment with an antiviral agent, such as azithromycin. Finally, patients with other systemic conditions (such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, liver dysfunction, or stroke), pregnant women, young children, and persons with certain psychiatric disorders should consult their physician regarding treatment options.

Q: I've had MS since birth. Since you were born, have you experienced any neurological impairment as a result? \nAnswer: Yes, your brain has remained injured throughout your life. The effects of MS include visual acuity loss and vision problems related to optic nerve damage. While people with MS typically develop new forms of blindness before age 20 years, it's possible some of your eye damage might occur earlier. However, we don't know how soon these changes will manifest themselves and what type of rehabilitation is required.

Q: Do my cognitive deficits change when I'm older? \nAnswer: Yes, older adults with MS experience cognitive decline and lower levels of intelligence, but they still exhibit normal learning capabilities. Many seniors report a better quality of life following treatment with MS therapies compared to younger individuals. Some patients can return to work and many feel no adverse affects","The diagnosis of MS, and the different forms it may take, require a different understanding. Many women with MS experience fatigue, joint pain, headaches, backaches, mood changes, and other symptoms that are consistent with MS. However, many MS sufferers also have unexplained symptoms like blurred vision or light sensitivity at night, nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, and other unexplained symptoms that can be seen in any type of disease or injury. Some women with MS also have unexplained symptoms that seem related to another condition such as fibromyalgia or depression, but doctors typically can't link them to MS. This is why it's important for women who have MS to speak with their physicians about these unexplained symptoms. You can learn more about what causes these types of symptoms by visiting www.ms-symptoms.org

What are some common reasons women with MS don't get treatment?

Many women with MS have had a poor prognosis from conventional treatments. When they did receive effective treatments, however, the results were usually short lived because they sometimes stopped taking their medications prematurely (called ""off-label""). Often, when patients stopped taking the medication, their symptoms worsened and there was no cure left. In addition, many women who don't want or need an intervention haven't been able to convince their doctor that they really need one. For example, some women with MS believe that taking certain antidepressants will make their menstrual cycles shorter and decrease their ability to conceive. Others use antihistamines, anticonvulsants, and antipsychotics (medication that treats schizophrenia). Some women simply refuse to accept treatment because they think the doctor isn't doing enough. Women with MS often feel ashamed and guilty about having MS; this creates a barrier for doctors to understand how debilitating and painful the illness truly is. It's up to the healthcare provider to help women gain trust so that they can receive the necessary care.","Many people feel that they have MS symptoms, and that may be true. However, the reality is more complicated than that. There are many different reasons why some people with MS may experience a severe flare-up of their MS symptoms in their later years, such as the time period between the onset of their MS symptoms and the onset of the early signs or symptoms of MS itself (such as fatigue) or the time during which symptoms started to subside (often about two weeks after the initial symptoms). For example, this could happen because an infection caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae causes inflammation of certain parts of the brain called the cerebellum (the part of the brain responsible for controlling movements), so that the muscles stop working properly, leaving the patient unable to walk, run or perform other important activities. Other factors include changes in hormones that help regulate the functioning of nerves, including changes in blood flow that can cause swelling of the legs or feet. Another factor is a change in the way certain cells use sugar as fuel, called glucose intolerance. This affects how energy is used by the body. A third, and related reason for the worsening MS symptoms, is a disruption of the immune system. The immune system helps fight off infections but has been known to fail in cases where it attacks healthy tissue like nerve endings or the brain, causing chronic pain and disability. Symptoms may also result from problems with the hormone production that controls muscle function.

How common is Multiple Sclerosis?\nAQ: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were 1.5 million new cases of MS in 2014, making it one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases affecting Americans. In 2013, an estimated 865,000 Americans had at least one case of MS.\r


It's not clear what percentage of people who develop multiple sclerosis will have the disease; if more than 10 percent of patients do, then we're talking about a very serious illness.\r


Multiple sclerosis affects everyone differently, but its treatment differs depending on whether you have it asymptomatic, chronic, active or ""classic"" MS. Type 1 (myelin sheath destruction), a less aggressive form of the disease, results in progressive weakness and loss of motor control over your limbs, fingers and toes. Patients who suffer from type 2 (neuropathy) typically don't show any noticeable signs or symptoms until they've lost significant amounts of myelin sheaths in each limb and face — usually within a decade","The symptoms of MS are similar in many ways, including the patient's body's inability to respond to medications. For example, a woman with MS may experience muscle weakness or stiffness, dizziness, and headaches when she is not taking her medication. Women also have lower than normal levels of white blood cells (leukocytes), which can lead to anemia, especially if they take their daily dose of estrogen. Menopausal symptoms can be caused by the withdrawal of hormone replacement therapy for women, an imbalance between male hormones and female sex hormones, or a lack of adequate bone health that affects both bones and muscles.

What does it mean to have multiple sclerosis?

A person who has multiple sclerosis will feel more tired, sleepy, and depressed than usual. She may develop chronic fatigue syndrome or osteoarthritis, and she will have pain in her joints such as her knees, elbows, hips, back, shoulders, or wrists. These problems are common among people who have MS. When you see one symptom associated with MS, it may indicate other illnesses or conditions. A doctor will usually tell you about your risk factors for developing MS and how treatment is likely to affect those risks. Many people who develop MS also suffer from other diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, sleep apnea, and certain cancers.","There is no direct correlation between the two. The diagnosis of MS in women does not exclude any other medical conditions and, in fact, many women with MS have other illnesses such as cancer or diabetes that can interfere with their menstrual cycles, which could be a possible contributing factor for these symptoms. It should also be noted that there may be genetic factors involved in both MS and menstruation.

Q: What are some other reasons why menstrual cycle problems might occur in people with MS?

A: Many MS patients report difficulty maintaining normal fertility because they experience pain during periods. In addition, other symptoms of MS, including nausea and dizziness, may cause significant discomfort during menstruation. For example, the following symptoms may increase blood flow to the uterus (amenorrhea) and lead to bleeding during your period: dizziness

diarrhoea

headache

chest pain

dyspnea

fainting Q: Do you think MS causes menstrual irregularities? A: Yes. MS is associated with an increased risk of menstrual irregularity; however, it is important to note that MS can result from several different conditions, so the exact cause of the problem cannot be established conclusively. Therefore, it is very important to evaluate whether one's own health status plays a role in creating a problematic menstrual cycle.

Q: What are the most common types of MS symptoms?

A: Other than MS itself, the most commonly reported MS symptoms include fatigue, depression, headache, anxiety, joint pain, infertility problems, mood changes, sexual dysfunction, rheumatoid arthritis and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Of course, some of these symptoms are associated with other diseases as well, including cancer, kidney disease, and autoimmune disorders. However, because MS affects more than 10 percent of all women who get diagnosed, and because of its increasing incidence over time, MS has become one of the top ten leading causes of female disability worldwide.

In addition, MS appears to affect women differently depending on their age. Women 65 years or older tend to have a higher rate of migraine headaches, depression, and fatigue than younger women do. Additionally, women with MS are less likely to develop breast cancer and cervical cancer. However, those women who develop MS within the last decade are at increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Finally, researchers believe that the overall number of new cases of MS will continue to rise due to the aging population, which will eventually require greater care and","Although the onset of MS is thought to be similar, women who have MS may also experience symptoms related to menstruation and/or PMS. This is because they may also have periods or have hormonal changes that can affect their menstrual cycles. Menstrual symptomology in MS is typically milder than in other forms of MS, but it does occur frequently, with some reports indicating up to 50% prevalence.[11]

PMS (period-related neuropathy) occurs when nerve cells in the legs are damaged or die due to a lack of blood flow. Symptoms usually appear within days to weeks after the initial injury, with varying degrees of severity depending on the type of pain involved. These include pain associated with muscle spasms, loss of sensation in certain muscles, numbness in others and painful swelling. Patients often report feeling tired during these early stages of PMS, and many complain of increased difficulty walking and balance, decreased mobility and mental functioning.

The most common symptom of PMS is tenderness and redness of the face, neck or back. It is more prevalent in women than in men, especially in younger women. The majority of people experiencing PMS will not seek medical attention for it; however, those suffering from PMS should consult a health care provider if their symptoms worsen.[12]

If you've ever had period symptoms but feel there's been no proper diagnosis, don't despair! There are several simple tests you can take to confirm that your period is normal, including a urine test called hysteroscopy—which allows doctors to measure the pH level of urine—and an endometrial biopsy, which allows them to detect abnormalities such as tumors, fibroids, cysts, or inflammatory lesions. If both these techniques show abnormality, your doctor may suggest treating the disease using medication and surgery instead.","As a person goes through the process of losing their menstrual cycle, they have more frequent and severe MS symptoms than those who don't.

Q: Is there any good reason for having a tubal ligation before you become sexually active?\nA: It is no longer recommended that women be sterilized before beginning sexual intercourse. In fact, it has been found in one study that the procedure could increase the risk of HIV infection by as much as five-fold. Even if you are not at high risk of HIV or other STDs, having a tubal ligation prior to sex might mean less chance of getting an STD during that time.

Q: What's the best way to prevent a pregnancy after I've had a tubal ligation?\nA: If you have not already started a family plan with your physician, he will perform an ultrasound scan on you and recommend fertility treatments such as donor eggs or sperm donors. Some doctors prefer to wait until you're fully fertile to start trying new birth control methods. This makes it easier to make sure a pregnancy does not occur.

Q: Do women have a right to go back into the uterus after tubal ligation?\nA: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends against this practice because of the risks associated with complications and death from uterine rupture after tubal ligation. You can read more about the risks of abortion and contraception here: http://www.ahrq.org/advocacy/abortion-and-contraception/.

Q: Can a woman get pregnant while undergoing a hysterectomy? \nA: No. A hysterectomy only removes tissue from outside the body. Your cervix doesn't enlarge. However, it may leave behind some scar tissue. If this happens, it isn't considered pregnancy since it won't result in delivery.

Q: Are all women treated similarly with tubal ligations and hysteroscopy? \nA: Yes. Both procedures involve removing part of the fallopian tube (the opening between the womb and the vagina). They both require follow up care as well as the same kinds of blood tests. Many women need to undergo further testing, though. These are called hysteroscopy scans. For example, a gynecologist might use special equipment to check the internal lining of your uterus. These scans aren't necessary unless you get other test results too. And remember, these examinations take place under anesthesia. That","Although the exact cause of MS is not known, some researchers believe that certain factors may increase a woman's risk for MS and other autoimmune diseases. For instance, some studies have linked MS with certain hormones in women (e.g., estrogen) or lifestyle choices. Other research has shown an association between menopause-related problems and the production of proteins called cytokines by immune cells called T helper T cell lymphocytes (ThT). Since cytokines are important for keeping healthy immune system functions intact, they might play a role in the development of MS. Finally, there is evidence to suggest that menopausal symptoms may be related to decreased levels of circulating estrogen.

Menopausal symptoms like hot flashes, bloating, fatigue, and weight gain are common among women who don't get diagnosed with MS. As time goes on, these symptoms usually go away. However, some women may experience additional symptoms such as increased pain and joint pain during menstruation (menorrhagia), which can last longer than expected before resolving. This condition is referred to as amenorrhea. Women may also develop other conditions in addition to MS related to their menstrual cycles. These include endometriosis, osteopenia, and pelvic inflammatory disease. Menstrual blood clots and bleeding around the uterus (amniotic fluid embolism, PMDD) can lead to stroke or heart attack. It is very difficult to predict whether an individual will develop any of these issues later in life because many factors influence both menopausal symptoms and MS symptoms at different times."
79,Question: Can I pass multiple sclerosis to other family members?\nAnswer:,"Yes. You may have multiple sclerosis if you develop the disease in your family. In order for your child or grandchildren to be affected by this condition, however, they must also have the disease. If it is unknown which parent(s) developed MS, and there are no siblings with the disease, then the children of both parents should not be affected. For information on determining a sibling's risk for developing MS, see Your Parent's Medical History.

Your health plan can tell you whether it covers any drugs that are specifically approved for treating MS. Some drug manufacturers offer generic versions of their products at a discount, so if you want to take an alternative medication or switch medications, talk to your provider about doing so.

What you need to know about prescription drugs You need to make sure you understand what type of drug you're taking before getting one. Read all the labels and instructions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how often you might get side effects and any possible interactions between different types of drugs. And check the label closely when changing medications to determine if you've been prescribed more than one treatment option. This includes new medicines (such as some over-the-counter and prescription medicine), vitamins, herbal supplements, dietary supplements, muscle relaxants, hormone treatments, blood pressure medications, allergy medicines, and surgical procedures. It doesn't matter what kind of medicine is being used – you could be taking two different kinds of medication at once. Learn more about the risks and benefits of each drug. And talk to your doctors or pharmacists about using a variety of drugs together.","Yes. The physician who has the authority to give a diagnosis or treatment in the case of any person under 18 years old must be informed that one parent may have multiple sclerosis and the other parent cannot. If neither parent is currently receiving care for MS, the parent(s) having the disease should take responsibility for monitoring for possible complications resulting from the pregnancy, including adverse effects on children, until such time as an appropriate medical professional can make a determination about whether there are problems with the child's development. However, it does not matter if both parents have multiple sclerosis—as long as one parent has multiple sclerosis, and the other parent doesn't.

Can my spouse or partner also get multiple sclerosis?

If you have co-morbidity (health conditions), such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease or cancer, all your potential partners will need to be evaluated in order to determine what they might be able to do to help you deal with the symptoms and signs of multiple sclerosis. A screening test is available at no cost that identifies people who could potentially become pregnant while carrying multiple sclerosis symptoms. It requires blood tests which generally take 2 weeks after starting treatment to see if the abnormal results indicate a fetus with multiple sclerosis. Some women have reported finding their urine containing elevated levels of antibodies against multiple sclerosis (molecular mimicry). These levels can then be used to evaluate the likelihood of a miscarriage or stillbirth (see ""Miscarriage risk"").

What are the symptoms of MS?

The most common symptom of MS is fatigue, but the disease may cause headaches, weakness, muscle pain, numbness or tingling sensations around joints, and trouble seeing clearly. Other symptoms include eye changes, cognitive dysfunction, depression, and vision loss. In some cases, patients develop MS when symptoms occur more than once per week and/or the disease progresses rapidly. Patients experience worsening and/or worsening of symptoms over time and can present with multiple neurological disorders. The overall prognosis for people with MS depends on many factors, including age, education level, gender, race, disability status, family history, severity of MS, and treatment response. People with MS face significant challenges, often including finding housing, work, and access to health care services. Many patients receive little assistance in paying their bills or saving money in order to live independently. They're often denied employment opportunities because of their MS. They're often forced to move away from their home town because of lack of transportation and other obstacles. More research is needed to better","Yes. You can pass a child's MS into their children, for example, if you are diagnosed with MS at age 20 or older and have not had the disease for more than two years. You may be able to do this if your spouse has been living with you for a long time and is at least 50% sicker than you. This means that they would require an additional diagnosis of another form of MS, such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia, or fibroid disease. However, these conditions generally don't last longer than about six months before treatment is discontinued, making it unlikely that your siblings will ever become affected by MS. If one sibling is treated for MS and the other doesn't respond to treatment, the second could get the same type of treatment as you. However, if both siblings are sick enough to need treatment, there is no way to pass on MS from one to the other.

If my husband was diagnosed with MS when we were married and I never got it, do I still have to take care of him even though he died in 2008?A: No. Even after someone dies, whether due to cancer or natural causes, they remain an individual living under a health plan. As long as that person lives in the United States, Medicare provides coverage to care for them. The law says that ""the surviving spouse is responsible for paying all benefits owed to the decedent, including but not limited to, medical insurance premiums."" Because this rule does not apply to spouses who die in another country, the only people who qualify for protection under this rule include the decedents' families. A person dies abroad or who doesn't live in the U.S., however, and his/her spouse isn't required to pay any costs associated with the death. Also, most states have laws requiring those close to someone who dies to pay some part of his or her debts, so that their relatives can take care of them.","No. You can't have multiple sclerosis in your own blood or your own body, as far as we know. But you can be in a family that is being affected by it through transmission from one parent to the next (or even more) and it's not going to cause any of those symptoms. The only thing it would do in this case is to make the other person sicker and more susceptible to some neurological problems, but it wouldn't actually result in MS. This question was asked on the ""Ask Dr. Piltz"" forum where Dr. Piltz answers questions about MS at his website http://drpiltz.com/

Q: How does having twins affect your treatment for MS? A: Twins are very rare, so it's hard to tell how much you're going to get out of them and what they'll do if you don't have them! To answer this question, look up your symptoms when you are younger, but also before you were born. Then ask yourself these questions: What do my family history and environment say about me? Would my mom have had twins?"" Do the other children in my immediate family have MS?"" If yes, then your chances of getting MS are pretty good. Most people with MS will develop some form of autoimmune disease, so the odds of developing MS is extremely high if you happen to have two sisters with MS.


If no, or you've been told that you're genetically predisposed towards MS, then your chances of getting MS are not great. And remember that when you're older, you could have siblings who have different immune systems than yours. As time goes on, it becomes harder to predict which sibling will develop MS. So if one sister develops MS, another might not. Your best bet is to start out with someone who has had their first symptoms in infancy and work toward that individual. You may find that there is some overlap between your genetic predisposition to MS and the symptoms of MS that you're experiencing today, so your chance of finding relief is increased if you take care of yourself well into adulthood.

How many times should a child of a twin go through chemotherapy each year? Answer: There is no set number of chemotherapy cycles that you need to complete. It depends on the type of cancer, how long you've had the illness and whether the illness lasts longer than three months. Cancer cells have a limited lifespan. Sometimes they divide back into themselves every few days and try again, sometimes they just die away or become inactive,","It depends on the symptoms you have. If they are not related to your MS, then no, it is not possible to pass them on to others. However, if your MS has caused any side effects or complications for others in the same household, this may be a factor that you should consider.\r

This question was answered by Dr. William Fudge, MD, in his article ""Can you pass Multiple Sclerosis to Other Family Members?"" in the July/August issue of American Medical News (Vol. 39, No. 6).\r

Many people worry about the fact that their spouses and children will receive an autoimmune reaction after getting older. This is true, but in most cases, these reactions do not occur because the immune system is compromised by multiple sclerosis. Rather, this occurs as a result of the inflammatory response that MS causes.\r

Multiple sclerosis is characterized by the destruction of the central nervous system's ability to produce new cells; the loss of nerve function; the progressive neurological damage, called relapses; and finally, the gradual onset of clinical dementia.[1]\r

How long does it take for MS patients to get sick? What kinds of illnesses cause MS symptoms? What factors affect what type of MS patients will get the most severe forms of MS and which ones won't?[2]

MS symptoms vary widely. Some people experience only mild symptoms while others experience symptoms such as joint pain, muscle weakness, blurred vision, trouble walking, or difficulty swallowing. MS affects men and women equally, even though some studies suggest that females are more likely than males to develop MS.[3]\r

The average number of relapses that occurs per year before a person gets the full course of treatment seems to depend on many factors. However, it is believed that there are two major risk factors associated with the development of early-onset MS: age at diagnosis, and family history.[4]\r

A person who develops MS between ages 35 and 45 will probably start developing symptoms within three years of being diagnosed, although some individuals will develop MS earlier, and still remain asymptomatic until death.[5]\r

If you suspect that your child may have MS, talk with your doctor. Your physician will help determine whether they would need treatment, and if so, how much. The sooner you seek care, the better.\r

Are","No, you cannot. You can be diagnosed with MS by someone else who is not affected by the disease. There are very strict rules about how and when it's safe to share a diagnosis with another person. It depends on many factors including the age of both parties, if there are siblings or significant others present, and whether they are aware of your condition. For more information on this topic, please see MS Treatment in Your Family (pdf).

Are you thinking about becoming involved in research for MS treatment? If so, what should I expect?

If you're considering getting involved in research for MS treatment, here are some important things to consider before joining an organization that may work together toward a common goal:

1. Consider the project's background and its goals carefully. This includes determining the potential impact of the project on individuals living with MS. A team composed of people from different backgrounds who have similar expertise will likely find differences in their responses to MS-related questions. And even though everyone would like to help, different groups might take radically different approaches, such as asking those with MS to focus only on symptoms while focusing on ""normal"" behaviors or activities; or those with MS taking patients' reports at face value but ignoring any side effects that may be associated with these behaviors or activities. As a result, each group may come up with slightly different answers. The good news is that the researchers behind the project already know what works, which means that they've got experience with making decisions based on the best available evidence. It also means that the researchers want all participants to agree on the outcome of the study--so everyone gets equally much out of the research.2. Make sure that your interests in MS are aligned with the investigators' goals for the project. As with most scientific projects, there are benefits and costs associated with being part of a consortium. But overall, the cost savings to participating organizations is often enough to offset the benefits received by others from cooperating with the project.3. Be informed about the risks and rewards of collaborating with any research group or organization involving yourself in research related to MS. Although some research is done without any specific knowledge about the individual patient, scientists must always be cautious about treating patients who haven't yet had symptoms. Many new treatments for MS may affect someone differently than those who were previously treated because of genetic or inherited characteristics. Furthermore, researchers conducting research aimed at understanding the underlying mechanisms underlying MS do so under the assumption that the person receiving treatment won't become ill again--even if that belief turns","No. Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the immune system. It cannot be passed from parent to child, but you can pass it on to someone else who has multiple sclerosis and then pass it on to your children.

I got my first diagnosis while in college when I was diagnosed with Lupus Lupus on my left wrist. Since then, all of my body parts have been affected by disease. My hands were numb, my feet were stiff, and most recently, I had an infection in my brain that spread through my brain into my heart causing my heart attack. Now, I'm going through my worst phase yet. What should I do now?

ANSWER: First, try to stop whatever has caused the problem before your symptoms become severe. It's possible this condition could develop into ALS if not addressed properly. Also, don't let your illness get so bad that you want to die. Take care of yourself and your health.

My sister and her husband are dealing with depression and anxiety issues, what should they do?

ANSWER: There are numerous things you can do to help ease these problems. Talk to your spouse or partner, who may know someone else with the same concerns. Find out about counseling programs available for people with depression or anxiety. If none exist, find a therapist or counselor who specializes in these disorders. Also, learn how to recognize warning signs and how to treat them effectively. You can also visit mentalhealth.gov for information on how to obtain treatment and find a doctor.

What is Lyme disease?

ANSWER: Lyme disease is a chronic bacterial infection that affects most people over time; however, some individuals show no symptoms at all. People with immune system deficiencies are sometimes susceptible to Lyme diseases, which occur mainly in adults. As many as 70 percent of all cases of Lyme disease go undiagnosed because of poor documentation of illnesses. Symptoms include a rash, fever, and headaches that last several weeks.

What would happen if I took two Tylenol tablets every day for 12 hours?

ANSWER: This seems reasonable. Unfortunately, Tylenol tablets contain acetaminophen, which is known to cause liver damage and can lead to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headache. Therefore, it makes sense to limit the amount taken during","No, because it is not an inheritance. The second question is why don't we have a law that says you can only pass one disease down by your own bloodline. In other words, if my wife inherits this disease, and then passes it on to her children in her next generation, then the children of those children are NOT considered sick or diseased. What would be the point of a law against inheritance if the offspring would NOT get this disease? The third question is how do we know what genetic mutations are inherited by siblings?\n\nIf there were no genetics involved then our society would collapse under its own weight. We would probably have no sense of decency. The answer, I believe, lies in the study of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y chromosome DNA (Y-chromosome).\n

In general, mtDNA (pronounced ""muh-TAY-din"") is passed from mother to child through each daughter's gamete membranes. Y chromosomes, which carry genes, are inherited exclusively by males. There may be some females who inherit their father's sperm. But since so few women carry the Y chromosome, men with Y chromosomes cannot pass them along to their sons. \r

There may be exceptions, however. A number of studies show that about 30% of all female carriers of the X chromosome produce healthy children without any evidence that they themselves carry the defective gene. This suggests that these women had no direct maternal lineages. Therefore, they must have had an additional male source of the defective gene. If such individuals existed, they might provide an explanation for the unusual occurrence of diseases in women with X chromosomes.\n

The following table summarizes some of the known occurrences of specific types of inherited disease:

You must also make sure that all of the following conditions apply to your child(ren) before passing on one's MS to another person: They are under 17 years old, they will be 18 years old within 6 months after birth, and they have been diagnosed with both MS and their first-degree relative has died. If the deceased had only a single parent, the child is not considered a distant relative, but rather a non-relative (i.e., they do not qualify for disability benefits).

81,Question: Can I work and study full-time with multiple sclerosis?\nAnswer:,"Yes. When you can work a job that is physically demanding and provides income (such as a sales position), consider working part-time or studying for a degree at the university level (in college). In addition, keep in mind that your health insurance will likely cover many of these expenses. If you have a disability, ask the employer about options available to provide additional compensation. The benefits from any medical care or therapy provided by an MS provider are limited if not covered by your employee's health plan. Ask the employer for details on the cost per patient visit and what other benefits may be available. For more information about benefits coverage and eligibility, go to HealthCare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596.

Q: Are there other ways I can help pay my premiums?A: You can participate in a Health Savings Account (HSA) program to lower your monthly premium costs. There are several ways to open a HSA, including through employers, Medicare or Medicaid. To learn more, go to HealthSavingsAccounts.gov. You can also apply for tax credits based on your household income, and possibly qualify for assistance with some ACA-related requirements. Check out our web page on health savings accounts for more information.

Q: What happens when I miss a payment or fail to pay it all?A: Your account balance is ""stabilized"" until you make a regular repayment or default on your loan. If you don't pay on time or default on your loan, the interest rate increases. This means that even though you've paid off the loan, you may still owe money on it. If you fall behind on your payments, you'll receive notice from your insurer. If you do decide to stop paying on time, your policyholder will get a credit against their account that they should use to reduce the interest on the remaining unpaid balance. Some plans offer these features; others require them. Be sure to check your coverage to find out how the feature works and whether your coverage covers it.


How can I contact the company offering this benefit?

Ask the company to direct you to the right person to speak with:

Employee Assistance Program at the Department of Labor, PO Box 30001, Room 20015, Washington DC 20210-30001

Insurance Information Specialist (IIS) at the Center for Individual Insurance Services (CISA) at 202-366-7337, TTY 711

If you live outside the United States, contact C","Yes. The National MS Society recommends that people who are diagnosed with MS have at least one job in their field of expertise to enable them to earn income and maintain independence. However, the MS Society also believes that working full-time is not sufficient for those living with MS to be able to live independently (see question number 2).

2. What do you need from me?\nThe following things should help make your life easier as a part-timer with MS or other chronic diseases: 1) A good relationship with your therapist; 2) An understanding that it's OK to ask about this kind of stuff; 3) Being able to give informed consent without feeling pressured to provide information or discuss issues that may conflict with my religious beliefs.

3. What if I can't afford to pay all of these things?\nFor example, what if you're making too much money or are struggling to get by financially? You might consider taking a leave of absence from your job or being flexible in how you take care of yourself to try to stay healthy during periods when it's hard to make ends meet. Alternatively, you could seek an unpaid internship. If you can't afford to travel overseas or out of state to find the training you need to practice medicine, your doctor will help you determine whether you'll need medical insurance to cover expenses such as health insurance, prescription drugs, and long-term disability payments (such as Social Security Disability Insurance). Medical bills often have to be paid before benefits begin, so finding ways to lower your monthly costs while saving up enough money to cover any future medical expenses will help keep you going in the long run. While there are some limitations on your ability to continue practicing medicine after leaving MS or another serious chronic disease, research suggests that even if you cannot continue working in full time, you likely will have more freedom than others with chronic illnesses to pursue hobbies or other interests outside of work hours. For example, your spouse or partner may be able to provide support for your studies and activities, which will allow you to better focus on your treatment goals and progress toward recovery.","Yes. However, you must be able to meet the following criteria for your degree of eligibility (see ""What's my qualification?"" above): You are a U.S. citizen who is not in prison or under correctional supervision.

You have no prior felony convictions.

No more than five years ago, you had an average income (as determined by the SSA) that was below $12,400 per year (or a family of 4 earning less than $15,000 per year). In addition, there can be exceptions for people with disabilities, who may qualify based on certain requirements and special circumstances. If you're qualified but need more information about your particular situation, ask us!

Please note that the SSA does not guarantee access to educational assistance programs. A person might be eligible only because he/she has a disability or because a federal law specifically authorizes such programs. For instance, it's possible to become ineligible due to a criminal record, even if the conviction never took place.","Yes.

Q: If I am diagnosed with MS, should I take part in clinical trials? What are the chances that I'll pass the trial and receive funding to pursue additional research studies?

A: Trials can help us learn more about how effective treatments might be for patients with MS. They can also determine if there's an acceptable risk and benefit ratio for clinical trials. We encourage our researchers to look carefully at patient data to ensure that they've identified enough patients to give them the best chance of success. However, we cannot guarantee specific results from clinical trials when funded. To learn more about how these programs work, go to www.fda.gov/medwatch/studies.html.

Q: Do I still get the opportunity to participate in research after being diagnosed with MS?

A: Yes! For people diagnosed at age 65 years and older, the National Institutes of Health provides funding for several types of research, including MS. Learn more about the NIH.gov website.

Q: Will the research I'm involved with be paid for by Medicare or Medicaid?

A: Not necessarily. These services were created through legislation designed specifically for MS, but many state governments now offer some type of reimbursement for the costs of participating in research and doing clinical trials. Most states charge less than $500 per person to participate in research, though some require individuals to pay a fee (often referred to as ""billing","Yes. Most people who want to can do this, even though they may not be able to afford it. However, if you are thinking about getting a degree, look into the many opportunities available in the MS community—there is an enormous amount of information for students looking to learn more about the disease.

Q: What should I tell my family or friends when I talk about having MS?

A: This is one area where it seems like everyone's opinion has been heard. Some of our patients have told us that telling their families will help them feel better about their condition. Others say that telling someone close to you what your illness means will make you feel less alone. Still others have said that they've felt very lucky that their loved ones knew. But it is important to remember that sometimes there is no right way to handle these situations. For instance, you may wish to speak at length with someone whom you think would benefit from knowing how difficult it is for people to live with MS (for example, a healthcare provider), or you might decide to share your own experiences of living with the disease without giving away too much personal information (for example, by sharing your feelings). Either way, try to keep your words short and simple so as not to overwhelm your audience or leave them feeling overwhelmed themselves.

Q: How does MS affect my ability to get along with other people?

A: When we hear someone saying something negative about MS, some of us are concerned that she/he may be blaming us for her/his symptoms. Asking questions such as ""how long have you had MS"" often helps answer those questions, but it also creates space for us to respond with empathy and understanding. Sometimes, though, some of our patients aren't aware that the answer to this question can be difficult to come up with in light of the complexity of the disorder itself. So before you ask the question, try to find out why the person was asking the question. Often times, patients don't realize that someone else may not understand their situation, either because they didn't experience it firsthand, they're unsure about what to say, or they didn't realize that any type of explanation would be helpful. In any case, talking things through makes the experience far easier.

When asked these types of questions, most people with MS will relate two different stories. One story may be a little easier for you to digest than the second; therefore, you need to consider both before responding.

For instance, a patient may","Yes. You can get a job as an intern or associate professor, but you must have MS to do so (and it is not necessary for you to be disabled). Other forms of employment may also permit you to work. For example, some college courses are available in MS. In other words, the government allows people with MS to work. The Department of Labor has published regulations on this, including rules for working while using a wheelchair. However, there are many limitations that apply. For instance, even if your employer does allow you to use a wheelchair, the cost of doing so will depend upon the size of the company. It is important to remember that if you lose your job because of your disability, it may become very difficult to find another one again if you want to continue to pursue your education and training.

Can I take out student loans to pay for my medical expenses?\nThe federal government requires all borrowers who borrow money from the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) to obtain insurance coverage through their jobs, including those at nursing homes and assisted living facilities. This means that if you are a senior citizen, you could potentially face significant student loan repayment costs over time. Some states allow students to qualify for a waiver based on income levels that would not require them to qualify for FFELLP insurance if they were to become unemployed. If you receive financial aid assistance, consider carefully whether your current job covers your health care needs (see below).

What about the law that says that all children should have access to public schools?\nThere is no federal policy requiring school districts to provide services in MS. But when it comes to education, school districts often offer programs that meet certain criteria for funding. These programs typically include physical therapy or speech therapy, tutoring, ESL lessons, arts and music instruction, or special education services. These programs usually come with high fees and/or strict requirements. Therefore, if you plan to enroll in these types of programs in your community, ensure that your local school district provides these services.

If I don't want to enroll in any of these educational programs, how can I attend class?Some universities offer additional activities such as art classes, clubs, musical performances, etc., and your school district might give you some help in determining which of these options are most suitable for you. However, it is likely that these extra benefits are more expensive than attending a traditional school. Even though tuition at some schools may exceed the amount needed to cover the cost of the required program","Yes. The Department of Labor recognizes that people who have MS can take advantage of educational opportunities available to them, both in their work place and at home. People with MS may also wish to pursue a career as a teacher or counselor for others with MS. These individuals are permitted to do so under a special exemption from the ADA. However, they must be able to demonstrate that they would not otherwise be qualified to perform the duties necessary for employment as such. Therefore, it is important to know whether you qualify for this exception before making any decisions about your future as an educator or counselor.

Q: What is covered by the disability insurance program (DI)?\nA: There is no specific definition of disability, but DI covers certain medical expenses related to MS, including medical care, rehabilitation services, rehabilitative equipment, and prescription drugs. Generally, there are three types of benefits: (1) a medical benefit for those patients with moderate to severe disabilities; (2) an educational benefit for students enrolled in accredited postsecondary schools or colleges; and (3) an income support plan for low-income working families where some members receive more than 50% of their net earnings through government programs. See http://www.dol.gov/programs/diabetes/default.asp

Q: How does the ADA apply to my child's school?

A: If you own and operate a private school, you must comply with all applicable federal laws and regulations concerning disabilities in education facilities and activities. Your child's school has access to Federal funds, including Title IV educational grants and scholarships. As long as the school complies with state law regarding education, it will not be responsible for complying with the requirements of the ADA.

The ADA requires that any student in a public school participate in all activities and facilities that are consistent with his or her particular needs and abilities. If a student cannot attend an activity because he or she has a disability, the school should make reasonable accommodations to meet these needs, including placing him or her on the disabled list when appropriate. You may consult with legal counsel if you believe your school has violated the ADA or another federal statute. In addition, be aware that many states require school districts to provide ""reasonable modifications"" for students with disabilities. Some examples include accommodating a wheelchair user who uses a walker, changing the seating arrangement of a classroom, moving a person with an intellectual disability to a separate seat, and changing or adding supplies and equipment. It may be difficult","Yes. Although the definition of ""full-time"" is not set in stone, you can do a lot of work while doing other things. You can stay at home with your family for a week or two to get back into it after having surgery and have an opportunity to go back into school; and, if you're really good, you'll be able to do that on your own. But there are limits -- as we've said before, there's no guarantee you will be able to continue working or studying at the same level once you leave MS. \n

Your doctor may suggest that you take some kind of medication. That could include medicines like Prozac (fluoxetine) or Paxil (paroxetine). It also might include medications such as Ritalin (methylphenidate), Adderall (amphetamine) or Concerta (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate). Some doctors prescribe a combination of these drugs called ""Combined Therapies."" Many people find they need them because they have trouble concentrating and remembering what they need to do and when. Others find they don't benefit from taking them but want to give themselves a chance to see if they could use them. If you decide to try any of those treatments, you should talk with your doctor about its pros and cons before deciding whether to start it.

Another treatment option that has been recommended by many physicians is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, which focuses primarily on how you think and behave while you're sick. This type of therapy usually involves listening carefully to a series of questions in order to learn more about yourself. These types of treatments aren't widely available in Canada, but you can find information online.

If you have severe symptoms of MS, one way to help reduce the severity of your symptoms is through medicine. The treatment options discussed above provide you with important support -- both physical and mental. Doctors often recommend medication to treat serious illnesses, including MS. When a person takes medication, it reduces the amount of blood flow within certain areas of the body that cause pain. Sometimes this means that a person must stop taking his/her medications temporarily."
83,Question: Why get episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis?\nAnswer:,"Because the disease is not treatable. In this particular instance, there are no drugs that work and no cure.""

Dr. Michael O'Neill, PhD, MSN, FAAP, FAHA, MSPH

""My best guess would be that they were trying to help their patient. The problem was that she was an MS sufferer, so I think the doctors were treating her for something else. But they didn't know it yet.""

Irene Krasny, MD, MSN, FAAP, FACP

In 2009, Dr. O'Neill published a study on his website entitled ""MS Relapse,"" in which he reported that 40% of people who had severe relapses after being treated with a combination of steroids, nerve blockers and corticosteroids experienced symptoms of relapse two years later. It wasn't until 2010 that Dr. O'Neill published another study on MS relapsing in which he concluded, ""The data regarding MS relapses is conflicting at best."" (See also his article ""Fluid Medication, Multiple Sclerosis, and Risk Factors."")

As you can see from these two studies, the MS community has known about MS relapses for some time now. But we still don't have answers as to why MS relapses occur or how long they last—if ever.

A History of Questions

For nearly 30 years the National Multiple Sclerosis Society has been asking patients with MS the question, ""Why do you have MS?"" We've tried different approaches, including a questionnaire sent out to all Medicare beneficiaries to gather information about factors that might cause MS (see below). Our results show that many people give misleading responses when asked that question. That's because MS is thought to result from genetic mutations in genes linked to myelin development and, more recently, from abnormal cell migration within the brain. As I mentioned earlier, research suggests that MS isn't caused by any single factor; rather, it develops together with several conditions, such as autoimmune disorders, infections, cancer and other medical problems.

So we're going to change course and ask the question again, starting with a new survey. This one will focus on our most recent findings on MS progression, which will include questions that allow us to answer both our own MS-related questions and those of others. We plan to use these new surveys to find out how common MS reoccurrences are among patients with other illnesses, and if these recurrence rates compare to those seen among","As far as I know, this is not something new to the medical community. It has been done for decades in various countries throughout history and even still today. In fact it was a treatment used in the past in both Europe and North America that helped people with Multiple Sclerosis to recover their function. It involved injecting certain substances into your bloodstream which increased the production of antibodies against some viruses, thus making them more effective at fighting off infections and helping you fight off disease. In other words, they were designed to help treat multiple sclerosis. In fact there are several studies from all over the world that have shown that these therapies actually work better than medicine itself! However, because these drugs are injected directly into your blood stream and can't be reversed once they're administered, many patients feel like they need to do something if they want to keep their condition in check. And what's more, many doctors don't understand how to prescribe or administer the drugs properly since they're often given on an outpatient basis. If you've ever had MS, then you'll know that taking medication every day may seem like a pain in the ass. This isn't true though; by taking medications regularly, you will build up an immunity that protects your body against harmful diseases. The more frequently your immune system attacks the pathogens in your body the less likely you are to experience flare ups, which makes it much easier to maintain your health, especially if your immune system is already strong enough to handle a virus outbreak. To clarify, the problem with the drug ""MS-001"" (also known as Relieve Me) is that there aren't any real treatments available to improve the quality of life and prevent relapses after someone gets an infection. There is no cure for MS; only a way to manage symptoms until they go away completely so you won't have to take any kind of meds again. Although it's possible that one could find a placebo effect to relieve the nausea/vomiting from MS sufferers' diarrhea, it wouldn't really matter since the medication would just make things worse instead of helping anyone feel better. But if you do want to try one of these drugs, then by all means make sure you follow the directions correctly. You will most certainly learn your lesson about taking an antibiotic daily and use a different antibiotic every two weeks (unless you think you may be having an immune response). If you're lucky enough to find out that the drug does help with the relapsing, you should consider going back to taking it every few months. After a while,","A study in the journal Neurology (Vol. 60, No. 9) found that people who had gotten their MS diagnosis from a neurologist tended to have more severe relapses after receiving an MRI than those with the diagnosis based on a physician and an interview with their primary care doctor.

Q: What is a relapse?\nA: A relapse occurs when there are signs or symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, irritability, pain, blurred vision or other symptoms associated with a medical condition. These can include headaches, loss of muscle strength, changes in bowel habits, diarrhea, constipation, joint pains, etc. If you want to learn about how MS works, see this article. \nIf your doctor says something seems wrong, ask him/her for help finding out what's going on. But don't expect your family or friends to understand anything. \nOnce you've been diagnosed, it may be difficult to live without the disease. You may not find work and often struggle financially. And if things get too bad, they'll probably tell you to go home to rest. In all likelihood, however, you will continue to do whatever you can to improve your condition.

When I have an attack that lasts for weeks it may be painful or even deathly so I'm often prescribed anti-inflammatory drugs to try and alleviate the pain but it also makes me feel worse and causes more inflammation in my brain and spinal cord. In this episode I'll talk about how we got into MS and why there are other diseases out there.

Episode Summary:","This is one of the most common questions I receive. For those who don't know, MS has been labeled as relapsing-remitting (RR) disease, when a patient has been active in MS for at least 10 years and continues to have symptoms even though their body can no longer produce any new white blood cells or other immune system components. Although there are several possible reasons why someone with RR may be experiencing an episode of MS, the answer is not always clear. People with RR may experience a few different things that might lead them to believe they have MS: They could think they have MS because of the flu or cold.

They could have had a brain tumor or stroke and then feel tired all day long.

They might have had treatment for another medical condition and have gotten better, but the next morning there was a sudden increase in pain or fever. The person could also have been pregnant or breast feeding and develop MS.

Someone with MS may have experienced loss of vision, especially if it was due to cataracts. Another reason people may think they have MS is because they've been taking some sort of drug (such as steroids), which makes the body produce more white blood cell production. In fact, the FDA recommends using drugs to treat MS, such as prednisone, or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen. These medications work well for a short time (several weeks). However, these medication treatments may cause more permanent damage to your heart than the natural course of MS. So, if you have MS, you need to understand how to avoid getting sick again before you become ill again. A good place to start looking is to learn about the signs of MS so that you can make the right decisions to take care of yourself.

When should I see my doctor? When should I see a physician?

There are many factors that go into determining when you should see a physician, including age, health status, allergies, and disability status. You should discuss this information with your family members or friends, especially since you will likely need to explain why you feel so poorly. Your primary care physician (PCP) will tell you what questions to ask, what tests to order, and what types of medicines are best for you. There's nothing wrong with asking any question that would help you determine whether your illness warrants attention from a PCP. If you're being treated for something more serious, however, you may want to find out about","The symptoms are similar to those associated with other MS-related relapses. This is because the first sign of MS is usually an exacerbation of the disease, especially in young people who have been given immunosuppressive drugs for years and then experience a period of ""spontaneous remission."" When this happens, there's no obvious cause that would explain the change in symptoms. For example, the patient could be taking a combination of prescription drugs (for example, insulin) or may just be having difficulty sleeping. So what could account for this sudden increase in symptoms? If you had another autoimmune attack, like anaphylaxis, it would seem to be related to the same problem. But the other thing to consider is that the symptoms may also be caused by something else that started when your immune system attacked an old injury—a cancer, say. That might explain why symptoms were changing right before the first MRI. And if they weren't, maybe you should have seen your primary care provider after the second MRI to make sure nothing was wrong. You could look at the results in one MRI so that your team can see how your body responds to treatment and help you decide whether treatment was appropriate.

Q: How do I know which tests will work best for me?

A: We recommend getting a diagnosis from a neurologist, such as Dr. Eric Finkelstein, or another specialist in MS. He or she can evaluate your condition and recommend treatments that'll work well in your specific case. Your healthcare professional can tell you more about each test and what to expect during your evaluation. A scan isn't always necessary, though. Sometimes it won't show any changes, even without a CT scan or MRI. Some tests don't detect MS symptoms entirely; for example, you may not notice much pain while lying down on a bed. In these cases, your physician might suggest using a noninvasive technique, such as applying pressure to the skin in different places along the brain. Another option is to use a neurofeedback device to monitor certain aspects of your brain activity and try to adjust activities that aren't working well. These devices can cost thousands of dollars; we encourage you to find out more information about them online. Finally, many patients find relief through a combination of medications, diet modification, exercise, and other therapies. Our team uses these approaches together to treat their MS.

Q: Does my child need an MRI? What about imaging for other conditions? What about genetic testing?

A: No one has","As Dr. Michael D. Davidson, M.D., explains in an article titled ""Multiple Sclerosis and the Medical Bias"", MS is considered to be a progressive disease, which means that patients with MS eventually develop relapses. This can happen for many reasons, including poor treatment (for example, drugs like steroids are often given when a patient has not had any symptoms) or a change in lifestyle that leads to more frequent attacks. Sometimes the changes don't cause a relapse but just make it harder to control MS symptoms. For this reason, doctors may recommend getting MS tested at least once every five years.

What's a good way to know if your condition is a relapsing one? In fact, you might have already been told to see a neurologist in case you got MS from something else. However, most people don't realize that they should also go see their primary care physician as well. The doctor who treats you will usually treat a whole range of diseases, so he or she would probably be able to tell whether MS was causing these problems. And even if the problem doesn't seem to be caused by MS itself, the doctor may still want to check in on how your situation has changed over time. Also, since the symptoms of MS tend to worsen in response to therapy, the doctor might ask about other treatments. Finally, there are several medical conditions for which there is a great deal of anecdotal evidence suggesting an association between MS and some kind of neurological dysfunction, such as ALS. Although it's possible that all of these factors contribute to the development of MS, it would certainly take a lot of research before we could say with certainty that they do.

Can You Get Diagnosed With Multiple Sclerosis Without Having Symptoms? \nYes, indeed! But what causes it? What does it look like? How does it affect your life? Well, here's where things become complicated. There are two ways to get diagnosed: through a blood test called a biopsy and by doing a physical exam. If you have been told that you have MS, then you need to meet with a doctor who specializes in MS to discuss your options. The best way to find out if you have MS is to visit an MS specialist. Even though MS isn't known to cause symptoms, it does occasionally occur after being treated effectively, as with neuropathy or Parkinson's disease. So, if your symptoms disappear within months or years of starting MS medications, then you won't have MS. Likewise, if your symptoms start again, you","If you are using MS medications, it is most likely your first symptoms were due to an autoimmune reaction in the body. The immune system attacks and destroys myelin sheath around nerve cells called axons. This leads to numbness, tingling, weakness, pain or stiffness. These symptoms usually subside when you stop taking the drug.\nBut if your brain has been damaged (radiation therapy), the damage can be permanent. Your brain will never fully heal after radiation. It may go into a state that can cause new diseases or problems such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and/or Lou Gehrig's disease. So it is important for patients with multiple sclerosis to see their neurologist every 3 months to make sure they are still receiving all appropriate treatment.

Q: What symptoms do I have to look out for at the office?

A: There are many signs and symptoms that may indicate a neurological problem. Most people who come to our office for MS symptom checkups are very surprised when we tell them about other physical signs and symptoms associated with MS that occur naturally in the body including: headaches; fatigue; nausea; vomiting; dizziness; sensitivity to light; muscle aches and pains; memory loss; depression; vision changes; joint pain; skin rashes; weight gain; and more. And many times these same symptoms are only detected during a routine visit to the office. We recommend that patients do a thorough examination at home before getting a visit from us because so often MS symptoms don't seem to emerge until later. For example, some women with MS develop chronic morning sickness that goes away on its own but others become ill with morning sickness once they start working full time. Often MS is not noticed until late in life when there are obvious symptoms such as tiredness, lack of energy, headaches, neck and back pain, mood swings and mood disorders. Symptoms like this happen frequently and need no special explanation. When you have symptoms that seem common in MS we want to investigate further to find the root causes. Our MS specialist will help you determine which type of symptoms are due to the primary cause: inflammation, neurodegeneration or a combination of both. In addition, if you have any of these secondary conditions then your doctor may refer you to a neurologist. But in cases where both conditions are present, our specialists may refer you to a neurologist for an extensive evaluation of both main causes and secondary effects. Sometimes patients with MS have trouble recalling certain events or remember things incorrectly for years. With","I have MS. It's not a medical condition, but it is a treatment for my symptoms and the disease itself. My mother had MS when she was young. She went through treatments that left her with disability, then eventually died from complications from this illness. I have been told many times over the years that I should consider going to the doctor, but each time I've gone the first step and decided against it because of the stigma associated with it. After all, why would you want to have your own private medical opinion done to you? This also means that if something like this ever happened in front of an audience at an event, I wouldn't be able to speak up on stage without having to worry about being called out by the crowd or worse yet, being harassed by the health care provider (not to mention how uncomfortable being seen with MS might make me feel). So far, I haven't heard anyone talk about anything related to this in public. In addition, there are a lot of people who don't know any better than I do about MS, so I don't think we'll hear much more of this kind of thing. \endquestion

I am a member of reddit's /r/MensRights board. I'm going to post here for two reasons: 1) I am afraid that I could lose my membership and thus my ability to participate with my fellow men, both on /r/mensrights and elsewhere; 2) As someone who has been involved in the movement since its inception, I am worried that the discourse regarding MRAs will become increasingly polarized, and that the discourse surrounding MRA activity may become even more polarized. While there has never been any official position taken by /r/MensRights, there seems to be a tendency towards taking positions that appear to validate the viewpoints of MRAs (including some that seem quite extreme), and which are difficult to reconcile with reality. The lack of focus on other perspectives within the community, particularly those of women, leads to a feeling of 'other'ness among the members of /r/MensRights that sometimes feels alienating, and makes it less likely that I can find allies amongst other men. In addition, some of the things that are said about us in /r/MensRights are simply unacceptable to me. I don't agree with everything that happens on the sub, but I recognize that these issues are important enough to warrant discussion. With regard to the second point, I feel that MRAs need to start talking","You're not going to be able to tell in the first few days. It'll take at least six weeks for it to fully show up on MRI, so you'll need to wait until then before diagnosing your MS.

How do I know if my symptoms are related to my illness or just me?\nFor instance, how much I drink is connected with my MS; can I still go out and work because the brain controls the kidneys? What about my smoking history? How did I catch my disease when I was young? All these things may have been part of my MS, but they're all also likely unrelated. When you find yourself asking ""What happened to me?"" you might want to visit an MD who specializes in this area, like Dr. Gail Anderson. The answer could surprise you!

Is there anything we can do now to prevent future episodes of MS?\nYes! MS does come back every once in awhile, but the risk is very low and manageable if you stay healthy. Take steps to keep things under control such as getting enough sleep, eating right, being active (like walking) and taking care of yourself. Talk to your healthcare provider about ways you can help prevent MS flare ups. If you experience any other side effects from medication or supplements, talk to your healthcare provider before starting them."
85,Question: Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis\nAnswer:,"The first stage of MS, the primary progressive form, is characterized by a loss of motor function and changes in vision. This first phase of disease usually lasts about 12 months but can last longer or shorter, depending on how severe the problem becomes. At that point, treatment starts with medicines to try to slow down the progression. After several years, the symptoms will go away again, leaving your brain functioning normally once more. The second stage occurs when the disease progresses into another type of progressive disease called secondary progressiveMS. This can be caused by many different factors including infection, viral or bacterial infections as well as radiation therapy. In both cases, if you are already taking medication for other conditions, it may not do much good against MS either. The treatments used in these two stages are different so there's no common cause for each one. However, they all involve using an anti-inflammatory medicine such as aspirin to help prevent inflammation from occurring. If this is not enough to halt the disease, then other drugs can also be considered.","The most common cause of relapses in MS is the presence of a neurodegenerative disease. A neurologist may recommend surgery to relieve symptoms, although many people are successfully treated with drugs such as oral or transdermal steroids. Other factors that can contribute to relapses include an abnormal immune response to medication, an exacerbation of symptoms after treatment has ended and/or severe head trauma (e.g., motor vehicle accidents) that leads to recurrent infections.

Q: What is autologous stem cell transplant?\nA: Autologous stem cell transplant is when someone who has had MS for at least 6 months receives bone marrow cells from another person. This allows patients to avoid all other types of transplants as well as any risks associated with existing graft-versus-host disease. Bone marrow donors can come from the family members of the patient, friends or coworkers.

Q: How does autologous stem cell transplant work? Can I have both autologous and bone marrow transplants?\nA: Yes! Autologous transplant occurs when a donor's bone marrow cells are removed from his body through surgery and then taken into the recipient's body. The patient would receive a transplant of these donor cells under general anesthesia using a process similar to giving blood transfusions or receiving injections of immunosuppressive medications. There are several procedures required before autologous transplant begins; this includes testing and preoperational follow-up visits. Blood samples must be drawn prior to treatment. After completion of the initial procedure, a total of 5 days will pass before tissue samples are collected for further analysis. Because this test is done on the outside of the arm, no one should know if the patient has received autologous transplant until after treatment is completed. If the sample shows no signs of rejection, it is considered positive and autologous transplant will begin. If there is resistance (i.e., the patient develops inflammation or immune system problems), the patient will need to wait longer before being given the new transplanted cells.

Q: Is autologous stem cell transplant safe and effective? Does it require additional treatments?\nA: No. In fact, autologous transplant is only performed in selected patients at specific centers around the country. It is possible to die during autologous transplant, but patients usually recover completely within 2 years. Most people who undergo autologous transplant do not develop complications, though some patients experience significant disability and others experience long-term disability. Some patients go","Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system.

If this is the first time that you have experienced symptoms of MS (even a mild one) or were treated with medications or therapy that has not helped you, then it's important to get a second opinion.

Ask questions if:

1. The disease recurs;

2. Your symptoms return during treatment and worsen again;

3. Your symptoms do not improve when you stop taking an active medication;

4. There are no symptoms that allow for diagnosis by someone who has experience treating MS.

If you're concerned about how long it will take to recover from an active relapse in MS, talk to your health care provider about whether you could be at increased risk of developing new MS-related problems (e.g., new neurological deficits) if you continue on an inactive drug regimen until you've recovered completely.


What About Multiple Sclerosis Risk Factors?

Multiple Sclerosis Risk Factors","Yes, this is a common symptom.

You will need to get your blood pressure checked as it can be high (high cholesterol) or low (low HDL).

If you have diabetes/syndrome(s), take insulin and talk with your doctor about the best treatment plan for you.

It may not seem like it but your brain actually creates hormones that cause inflammation which causes your symptoms. If you are experiencing low energy, then you are just being more sensitive.


What's the deal with the low glucose levels?

Low glucose levels tend to occur during times of stress, such as when working hard for an exam, finishing up assignments, etc. This can also happen if the day is very stressful due to work, school, or other situations, especially in first year (or even later years.) Low glucose can cause headaches, dizziness, fatigue, joint pains, and muscle aches. It can affect any part of your body and make things feel worse. The best way to avoid this is to stay hydrated throughout the day and eat lots of fruits, veggies, and healthy fats.

I did some research on this so I know what hypoglycemia means. Hypoglycemia occurs when your blood sugar level falls below normal range. Your blood sugar may drop between 4-6 points lower than norm. To help prevent this from happening, follow these tips:

1. Drink plenty of water.

2. Eat a variety of foods. Some vegetables contain sugars, while others don't.

3. Keep your eating low carb (i.e., no refined grains) and keep exercising at least 2-3 hours per week.

4. Stay away from sweets, desserts, alcohol, caffeinated beverages, sugary drinks, and fast food. These all increase your blood sugar. Avoid anything sweet because they do NOT reduce your risk of hypoglycemia!","A number of factors are known to influence relapses in MS. Among them, the underlying cause(s) and treatment regimen, as well as the individual's level of disability at time of relapse/recurrence, can all be important factors.

Relapse rates for chronic fatigue syndrome patients were reported at a rate of 25% (1). However, the incidence of relapses may also be influenced by other factors such as: the severity of the illness; whether or not it is treated with steroids; how long MS has been ongoing; and whether it has been caused or exacerbated by another medical condition. The causes of relapse for MS have yet to be clearly established, but there is evidence that certain immune-related disorders may affect relapses. For example, T-lymphocyte activation has been shown to reduce both acute and chronic relapses (2, 3). In addition, several studies suggest that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which commonly accompanies COPD patients with MS, may impair immune function (4–7). Thus, it appears that the presence of any of these conditions could exacerbate relapses.

Some of this information may lead us to conclude that some people with MS should avoid taking immunosuppressants, like corticosteroids, during periods when they are already experiencing exacerbation of their disease. Alternatively, people who do take immunosuppressant drugs should talk to their healthcare providers about whether or not they would be better off getting help for their MS. If you would like more information on MS and treatments, please visit our MS treatment page.","A.M.

Q: What should I do if my symptoms worsen?

A: See your doctor.

If you are experiencing relapse of MS, see a physician within 1 week to determine the cause and treatment options. This will enable him or her to make recommendations for appropriate therapy. If relapse has occurred, follow-up with the patient's health care provider is recommended. This may include referral to another clinic or specialist in an effort to find out what further steps can be taken to improve symptoms (e.g., neurologic evaluation, MRI scan, etc.).","Yes, that is a very common syndrome. It is called'multiple sclerosis re-entrant' or MSR or MSR for short. As the disease progresses, it begins to cause symptoms that are similar in intensity to those of relapses. Symptoms include weakness, pain and stiffness in one arm or leg; fatigue and muscle aches; depression; memory loss; problems with vision, hearing, balance and swallowing; and many other conditions. The severity of these symptoms may also vary from person to person. In general, MSR is often caused by an autoimmune process which involves the immune system attacking the myelin sheath covering nerve fibers (nerve fibres) that surround nerves. MSR can be seen as a progression of relapses resulting in chronic pain and difficulty with movement.

Q: What causes MSR?

A: There are many different theories about why people develop this condition. Many scientists believe there has been a genetic mutation that leads to MSR and most researchers agree that the disease starts when the gene responsible for producing white blood cells - MTHFR - ceases to function properly. If someone with MSR inherits two copies of this faulty gene and one normal copy, they will have no risk of having their own child to pass on this inherited trait. However, if both parents have two mutated copies, then the chance of passing down this mutation increases. People who inherit at least one mutant allele should not have children, as they may suffer lifelong health consequences. Some research suggests there may be environmental factors that contribute to MSR. For example, it was suggested that some people with MSR may experience a certain chemical reaction during pregnancy that might damage the baby's developing brain. This could increase the risk of birth defects.

The symptoms of MSR appear to begin in early childhood and are thought to involve an overactive immune response, which is known as autoimmunity or auto-inflammatory disease. Autoimmune disease occurs when your body produces too much anti-receptors (antibodies) against a particular type of antigen – proteins produced by your body when you eat foods like peanuts, eggs, dairy products or soybeans. The antibodies you produce in response to these food substances attack and destroy the tissue lining your lungs (eosinophils). These cells line up along the walls of the airways and help remove bacteria and debris. You get tired easily, you feel weak and dizzy. Your breathing becomes shallow and it takes longer to breathe deeply. Often you cough frequently, even after coughing","Yes, MS is the same in those with and without chronic relapses.

86,Question: Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis\nAnswer:,"A primary progressive multiple sclerosis.

A secondary progressive multiple sclerosis is a disease in which the underlying brain lesions are more severe than those found in primary progressive multiple sclerosis, or PPS.

The term ""primary progressive multiple sclerosis"" usually refers to patients who have both primary and secondary progressive MS, but it can also include a patient with no MS. In these cases, the diagnosis may be made by imaging techniques that show only a single lesion on MRI of the brain.

The clinical history in such cases is often extremely difficult to interpret; however, most clinicians believe that many neurologic symptoms arise from the central nervous system (CNS) infection.

Many clinicians will recommend that patients who develop a secondary progressive multiple sclerosis consider having their immune systems tested for infection, because such tests are often done early in the course of the disease. The results should exclude infections caused by C. difficile bacteria, norovirus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), HIV/AIDS, and other blood-borne pathogens.","Yes.

A secondary progressive multiple sclerosis is a disease that strikes patients with progressive multiple sclerosis who are unable to self-administer their anti-MS medication, either because of severe liver and kidney failure or complications from the disease itself. The number of cases of such secondary progressive multiple sclerosis has been increasing in recent years, but there have not yet been sufficient studies on the role of anti-MS medications in this situation.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of rituximab (ritonavir) on the rate of progression of primary progressive MS and the risk of developing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis compared to placebo. Thirty-nine patients were randomized into two groups (placebo; n = 17), one receiving rituximab (5 mg/day) and the other placebo (n = 12). These patients received monthly injections for 6 months followed by 1 year follow-up. The primary endpoint was the time to first clinical relapse within 5 years after initiation of treatment. Patients were evaluated at baseline and at each visit thereafter for improvement, and they underwent MRI scans every 2 weeks during the follow-up period. A second primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of new or worsening symptoms within 10 years of initiating treatment. After adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index, rituximab significantly reduced the rates of clinical relapses and increased the risk of developing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. In addition, both groups experienced statistically significant improvements over placebo. The combined results suggest that rituximab may reduce the incidence of progression of primary progressive multiple sclerosis.","SPS is a disease that has two main pathogenic mechanisms. One of them, the autoimmune one, affects cells throughout our body called myelin, which makes us feel as if we are being attacked by an invisible enemy. The other is a genetic disorder called primary progressive MS in which the immune system attacks the nervous system causing progressive damage to the brain and spinal cord (the'spinal cord' part of the name). Some people with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis also have optic neuritis, a condition where the damaged optic nerve causes visual impairment on one side of the face and loss of vision on the other (a side effect usually treated by using glasses or contacts) but not both sides. The two types of disease can be seen differently depending upon which type of spasticity you have. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis involves the development of lesions in specific areas of the brain and spinal cord known as neurofibrillary tangles. These lesions cause motor dysfunction and memory problems, along with weakness. They often begin at the age of 20 and continue into adulthood. Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis may involve more diffuse changes, such as atrophy of certain parts of the brain and spinal cord. It is very rare for someone who develops MS to develop the autoimmune disease MS.

Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis: What is it?\n Answer: There are no exact definitions of what constitutes a ""primary"" or ""secondary"" progressive multiple sclerosis; however, there are some broad characteristics common to both. The first characteristic is that there are at least 2 different diseases that share similarities but differ greatly from each other. In addition, they both affect the central nervous system. Another difference between these 2 disorders is that MS occurs when one half of a person's immune system is attacking another half of their immune system, while SPS is associated only with the central nervous system. Finally, it is important to note that although both conditions require treatment, most people with SPS do so successfully without drugs or surgery. For more information about how to treat your symptoms see this web site on treating progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

What Causes SPS? Answer: No one knows exactly why SPS occurs. It has been proposed that it results from an imbalance in the production of various immune factors. This balance might result from a change in hormones, perhaps due to infection, chemotherapy, or radiation treatments. A study published in the August 1999 issue of Neurology included data showing that the body produces antibodies against macrophages, which help remove debris and foreign substances from","It's possible.

Holly · 8 years ago","No. If you think the answer to this question is ""yes"", then you should not seek further information from us as we do not provide any clinical advice, and therefore cannot possibly know what will work for your case.

Q: Are there any other causes of MS?

A: There are no known causes of MS. You could be suffering from a rare condition or you might have had a prior history of the disease. However, we would advise against making any diagnosis based solely on the symptoms alone, so you should consider all of the above before undertaking any treatment.

Q: How long does it take for a patient with MS to get better?

A: While every case has different reasons for their improvement over time, most people report improvements within 3-6 months, however some people may require more than 6 months. Generally speaking, the longer you wait to see an MS specialist, the harder the process is. We cannot give specific details about how much longer it takes patients with MS to improve due to confidentiality issues.","As a result of the progressive disease, you may need to have your spleen removed.

Treatment for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis is based on the clinical characteristics and response of the patients to treatment. A single therapy can be effective in all patients, but there are some patients who respond well only to one or two therapies, thus requiring more aggressive treatments. This approach has been employed with success in cases where the primary course is unresponsive.

To date, several different types of immune-related agents have been used as immunomodulatory agents. The most widely used antineoplastic drugs are cyclophosphamide (CPA), interferon alfa (IFN) β1α/β2, and erythromycin. These drugs have shown promise in animal models of MS and in early human studies were found to improve disability and survival time when compared with standard disease management. However, many of these early reports failed to demonstrate whether CPA or IFN β1α/β2 was more effective than placebo in treating MS symptoms. In a double blind randomized trial comparing CPA and IFN β1α/β2, however, both drugs showed efficacy, although neither drug had an advantage over placebo. In a subsequent phase II study using CPA alone or combination with IFN, neither drug was superior to placebo in reducing disability and improving quality of life [28]. Similarly, a double blind controlled trial of IL-10 administration versus an active comparator revealed that in the case of patients with relapsing-remitting MS, IL-10 improved symptoms compared to placebo but not IL-12 [29]. Although IL-10 does show promise in treating MS, its effects on disease progression are unclear. There are few data available regarding the possible role of CPA, IL-10, or other non-immune-stimulating agents in the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. In a recent Cochrane review that focused exclusively on the use of immunotherapies in the treatment of relapsed or refractory MS, it was concluded that there is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to support any specific therapeutic strategy, suggesting that future research should focus on identifying novel target compounds with potential efficacy in this important indication. Additionally, there have been no major developments in the area of alternative treatments since publication of the Cochrane review in 2008.

There have been advances in our understanding of how cells behave in autoimmune diseases, which make them much easier to treat. It has become clear that various factors","Yes.

Q: Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis? How does that relate to MS?


A: The primary reason for MS is inflammation and a host of other illnesses including cancers, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus, obesity, heart disease and stroke. However many people don't realize it is just as important for the immune system to attack those diseases as it is to protect against the inflammation caused by these conditions. When you have multiple sclerosis you also have an increased risk of developing cancer of the breast, prostate and colon because your body doesn't function correctly under stress.


As far as the secondary progressive multiple sclerosis thing, this is actually a type of secondary progressive Multiple Sclerosis which affects about 10 percent of all cases of MS and often doesn't require any treatment at all. If you already had MS before and were still being treated with steroids or other medications in addition to therapy, then if your MS became worse, the cause was likely not because of MS but rather you developed secondary progressive multiple sclerosis after getting off treatment. It's rare, but if you are treating yourself you should see a doctor about it!","The primary progressive disease is a progressive loss of muscle mass. There are various degrees, and it can be severe enough that the patient will lose all function in the limbs, including walking and breathing, as well as their ability to use their hands or arms. This is the most common form of MS.

Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS) is when there are no signs of progressive atrophy in the muscles of the trunk or legs, but symptoms still exist. It can be diagnosed by an MRI scan, or if a person has one of several other imaging tests. People who have PPS often report fatigue, pain, weakness, and abnormal movement. Many doctors suspect PPS because they do not see any changes in brain functions like memory, thinking, speech, or coordination. Many people experience problems with swallowing, vision, hearing, balance, etc., which may also indicate PPS. Although many people with PPS remain in denial about what's wrong with them, at some point they realize that their condition is slowly killing them. Patients must learn how to live independently again; many make a living from assisting others with disabilities such as walking, cooking, cleaning, nursing, etc.; however, some only survive for up to 3 years after diagnosis, although some recover completely.

Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS) occurs after one of these two types of MS develops. It is characterized by significant muscle atrophy, but does not always show the same features of PPS. Symptoms may include joint stiffness, spasticity, weakness, numbness, tingling, cramps, or paralysis. These symptoms usually occur within 6 months of the onset of the first sign of disease. Rarely, SPMS may cause neurological deficits like difficulty speaking or walking. Patients commonly report feeling tired all day long and sleep problems, and sometimes even depression or suicidal thoughts. Some people develop severe physical limitations, while others require extensive support. Most patients go on to find another career, but those who need help often choose medical assistance due to stigma attached to this type of disability.

Treatment options for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis include medications, surgery, therapies to strengthen joints, and psychological treatments. Depending on the severity of the injury, treatment typically takes between 2-4 weeks to complete. However, a person may benefit greatly from immediate therapy before being placed on medication, since more than 80% of patients die within the first year. In cases where there is lingering pain, corticosteroid injections may relieve the symptoms, and possibly prevent","As with most diseases, the progression of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis is not linear. There are many factors that contribute to the development and progression of this disease including age, genetics, treatment, and environmental factors (e.g., medications, nutritional status). Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis: The primary progressive multiple sclerosis stage can be broken down into two separate phases: early-onset and late-onset. Early-onset is when there is no change in symptoms but is characterized by a single or partial loss of movement of the upper limbs. In these cases, patients typically experience pain on one side only for about 4 weeks before any worsening occurs. Late-onset is when symptoms worsen over time and the patient has difficulty walking due to limb weakness or paralysis. Patients who have both early-onset and late-onset MS usually require an advanced course of therapy at least 6 months apart.

What is the diagnosis? What is the prognosis? What causes secondary progressive multiple sclerosis? Is the diagnosis correct?

The diagnosis of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis depends on the characteristics of the individual case, the specific cause(s) of the disease, as well as the presence and severity of symptoms.

Is it possible to get sicker with each successive episode of MS?

This question was asked frequently during the initial rounds of clinical trials. However, this question needs to be reevaluated because the overall incidence of new onset MS has risen dramatically since the 1980s. For example, from 2000–2004 the incidence of first MS episodes increased by 50% while the number of subsequent cases declined by 45%.

If you think you may have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, you should consider contacting your healthcare provider. You may also want to ask if you will need further testing before receiving treatment. If so, you may wish to consult with a neurologist or neuropsychologist (a mental health professional trained specifically to diagnose MS), a pediatrician, or a genetic counselor.

There is no reliable way to test for MS. To find out if you are susceptible to developing MS, some experts recommend testing for the antibodies to TNFα, which are present in large numbers in people with active MS and appear to play a role in preventing new disease recurrence. But testing for these antibodies is expensive and rarely available. And even if antibody tests were available, they would probably not give you much information; however, they might be useful as screening tools against other types of autoimmune disorders, such as lupus erythe","No. This is a new disease that was first described in the 1920s and has many similarities to MS. The symptoms can be very similar, including headaches (often called ""brainfogs""), fatigue, muscle weakness, numbness in arms or legs, and difficulty swallowing.

Q: Secondary progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy\nAnswer: Yes. This is also known as AML. It's characterized by progressive disability after the onset of MS, which may last up to 15 years. There are no specific treatments for this condition.

92,Question: causes of fatigue in MS\nAnswer:,"Some people have MS who are very tired and their symptoms don't get better with time. Others have a chronic, disabling illness that keeps them awake at night until they go to bed at night.""

A: ""It's not the fatigue itself that causes it to be so bad,"" says Dr. Richard J. Miller, director of neurology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. ""The problem is when you're asleep or sleeping for long periods of time without rest -- which can happen, especially during sleep deprivation -- there's an overload on your brain cells"" called myelin. This insulating layer protects nerve cells from injury, slows down cell division, and prevents them from dying off. Myelin also helps transmit signals between neurons and enables one to send electrical impulses in another. The more myelin you lose while awake, the worse your condition will become. In addition to stress, inflammation, infection (including HIV), and other conditions, fatigue also has been linked to poor blood circulation, lack of oxygen, dehydration, infections, and obesity, as well as other physical ailments such as heart disease, high cholesterol, and diabetes. It affects every organ system but bone marrow, liver, kidneys, and fat tissue. But while many patients feel fatigued during sleep, some can improve and even regain the ability to function by simply waking up and taking a short break. Many people develop sleep problems later in life, however, especially those who've had fibromyalgia. They experience morning stiffness, frequent colds, headaches, fatigue, and depression after they're no longer able to stay asleep throughout the day, often going back to work at night. A small number of studies have shown that sleeping less does help reduce the severity of MS symptoms. Although researchers know more about how these treatments may work, there is still much research needed before any medicine or drug could be used effectively to treat this debilitating disorder.","It is not an easy disease to treat. It has multiple causes and there is no one single cause that can be identified for all cases or even those who have a mild form of the illness. The most common cause is sleep deprivation, though sometimes this factor is not so obvious (some studies show that patients with high blood pressure are more likely to report fatigue).

A variety of other factors may contribute as well, including stress, alcohol and medication use, all of which increase the risk of developing fatigue over time.

Many medications used to control symptoms also increase your risk of having the same problem over time. For example, antidepressants can decrease your ability to recover from fatigue and they increase the chances that you'll continue to experience it throughout your life. This is especially true if you take them for insomnia or depression because both of these conditions affect your recovery from fatigue.

If you do decide to try some form of treatment for MS at home or on-site, ask your doctor about what he/she considers safe, effective and suitable. Try to find out from your physician whether you should take any other medications besides those listed above. If you're taking antifungals or antihistamines, be sure to check with your doctor before changing any part of their regimen.

Q: Can I go back to working? A: Yes! Most people who have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis can return to work after a year or two without significant problems. In fact, many return to work within six months of diagnosis. Some experts think that you can be returned to normal activity by about 18 months after being diagnosed; others suggest a longer period.

However, it's important to remember that returning to your old job will require extra commitment, possibly involving changes in your lifestyle. Your doctor can help guide you through such adjustments, but ultimately, if you want to get back into your new job after a few years, it's up to you. Don't forget that you've already gotten much better when you were sick and that you can still benefit from working again.","The main cause is a buildup of amyloid beta, which results from the immune system attacking its own tissues.

How often do you see people have headaches after going to work?

Answer: Yes, we usually see them as they are getting ready for the day.

Is there anything that makes us want to get up and walk around?

Answer: Yes, because it helps us feel better about ourselves and our health.

What is the most common reason for bed-wetting?

Answer: It's either an upset stomach or a bad night's sleep. This can be due to a number of factors like colds, cold flashes, colds that don't go away, and others.

Do you think there's any way you could be healthy enough to get married or start a family if you didn't take care of your body?

Answer: I think it's possible. I've seen many cases where someone was sick with cancer who had no symptoms or even went so far as to say ""I'm not sure I would ever live this long without being able to give my kids everything they need.""

What has been your biggest accomplishment through your life?

Answer: Being able to help people living with MS through the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's Caregiver Program (http://www.msncsociety.org/caregivers).

Have you ever met anyone that truly understands MS? If yes, what did you find out?

Answer: Yes, I have met plenty of people who understand MS. Most were just doing their jobs. There are some that try hard to understand, but I never really found anything that made me believe they really understood MS.

What advice do you have for someone diagnosed with multiple sclerosis? What questions would you ask them if you got to know them well enough?

Answer: First of all, talk to them about it. You will be surprised how much they will appreciate your understanding. Second, make sure they know what treatment options are available to them. Don't wait until they come down with a virus. Find out what treatments are on the market now. Then talk to them about using those products. You might also recommend them seeing an allergist or doctor. Also check into their diet habits. They should eat something that is high in protein such as fish, poultry, nuts, soybeans, etc. Lastly, listen to them and tell them when they are tired, dizzy,","1) Low carbohydrate intake (ie, high-carbohydrate diet with little or no protein). This is one reason why I recommend an elimination of the low-carbohydrate diet. Carbohydrates are necessary for energy, but they also contain a lot of sugar and many other elements that may be harmful.


2) Insulin resistance. The more insulin you have, the less fat you burn. It's not as bad as it sounds. You can tolerate large amounts of insulin without problems. If your body gets used to insulin, you don't feel tired much more than when you didn't get enough at all. The problem is when you start to increase your insulin level too much and keep it up too long; this can cause damage to your blood vessels.


3) Fatigue because your muscles become slow and weak. Muscle glycogen stores (blood glucose) hold on longer before being depleted. When your muscle glycogen levels are very low, you can only use so much energy in a day. As soon as they're full, the rest of your body starts to use them up instead. Some people even call this ""fatigue."" I call it ""dysfunctional metabolism"" because the system becomes worse each time you take a hit.


4) Lack of sleep. There are some studies showing that short bouts of sleep can help decrease your energy levels. But if you're constantly going out and working hard, you won't get enough sleep anyway. So getting more sleep will be counterproductive.


5) Inactivity. Inactivity is another symptom that happens during periods of intense work. Without stimulation, we lose our drive and creativity. But if someone keeps themselves busy, they'll eventually forget about their own job and go off to do something else. They might think, ""Hey, maybe I should just stay home from work today,"" which means they'll miss the chance to exercise, run around a bit, read a book, etc. Again, you need an active lifestyle. People who are inactive often say that the ""job"" does not pay enough, so they quit. However, if the person stays active, they might find that working overtime improves their productivity. And some people say, ""I'm not doing any better than average, so why bother?"" Since a job is a valuable asset in itself, those people probably know how to compensate for the lack of income.

6) Other health issues. High blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, arthritis... All of these things may","#1 - Overuse of the neuromuscular system

The body uses a lot of energy to maintain its internal structure, muscles and skin. The amount of energy that you use every day is different for each person. It can be as little as 5% or 100% of your daily needs. This means if you're using 10% of your daily energy then you have to do something else at least once a week. If you keep doing this repetitively it's going to eventually wear down your nervous system causing a lot of symptoms such as headaches and sleep problems. So what are you supposed to do? Well, if you find yourself avoiding activities because they don't feel good, then that's another problem. There is no cure yet but there are several things that can help (and I'll explain why below):

Meditation - By practicing meditation, you are able to relax and decrease stress levels so that you will not be stressed about anything anymore. You can also improve your ability to deal with the occasional discomfort from some types of exercise too. However, it won't stop all your other issues.

In answer to your question I would say that the most common cause of fatigue in MS is postural instability which has a direct impact on the lower extremity (hip and knee) muscles. This condition can lead to the symptoms you describe including pain, weakness, muscle cramping, tightness or weakness in these areas. If you have problems with postural instability there are some things you can do, such as stretching, exercises to strengthen joints and strengthening of your body's own natural movements. Other things you can try are: changing positions while lying down; walking or doing other activities that will allow you to stand up straight without losing balance; standing with arms fully extended while sitting down or leaning forward; and using push ups to increase strength.

I hope my answers help you understand how the lower extremities work together to keep the legs stable. You can also visit our website for more information on the effects of postural stability and other factors involved in fatigue in MS.

Cessation of activity in a particular area of the brain has been reported to improve muscle strength and decrease muscle stiffness [6]. However, this has only been found to occur after 4 weeks[7] and a more complicated mechanism seems to have to play a role. The study by Hernández-Fernandez et al. found ""a correlation between the magnitude of improvement and the duration of the intervention"" but did not provide any explanation for the correlation. Also it must be noted that ""the study had limited statistical power, which limits the reliability of our results.""

Some researchers think this fatigue may be caused by a decline in the activity of specific cells within the muscles themselves. Other researchers suggest that fatigue could be due to ""tiredness induced during exercise"" [8], although they do not know why this might happen in healthy people. There is also evidence from animal studies suggesting that exercise can increase levels of serotonin, a mood regulator. While the effect of exercise on serotonin hasn't been studied in humans yet, there is some evidence that exercising increases dopamine levels in the brains of rats; however, this doesn't seem to help with fatigue [9]. So far all the studies that have looked at whether physical exercise helps reduce symptoms of fatigue have found that it does, and the research isn't conclusive so take those findings with a grain of salt.

Another possible reason for increased fatigue is that the body's immune system is damaged due to aging and/or disease. If you've ever taken immunosuppressant drugs such as warfarin or cyclophosphamide, then you're probably familiar with the feelings that you get when taking these medications for months without a break. Researchers think that if older adults were given vitamin C supplementation throughout their lives instead of taking them every few years like many Americans, their immune systems would be able to survive longer and fight off infections better, which may explain why we see fewer serious illness in elderly people than younger people [10]. Vitamin E supplements have been shown to help lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels in people over 65 [11] though they don't appear to do much for reducing fatigue.

A recent review [12] looked at the potential for vitamins A, D, E and K to prevent diseases and health problems linked to aging. They concluded that while they couldn't find","1. The brain is always tired, even when the body is rested and eating a balanced diet. 2. The brain needs to be refreshed by stimulation from the body during physical activities (sports, working out). 3. In addition to all these reasons above, there are also some other factors that can cause fatigue. These include stress, poor sleep quality, depression, anxiety etc. 4. Some people have more problems with cognitive function than others. These people need less rest. 5. Many women complain about headaches when they are pregnant. This could lead to a higher rate of menstrual periods as well as an increase in fatigue. 6. People suffering from chronic illnesses such as cancer or heart disease often suffer from short term memory loss and increased fatigue due to this condition. 7. It's not unusual for many doctors to see cases where patients come in complaining of fatigue after having a long day at work.

(Source: http://www.msnbc.com/news/reliable-facts-about-fitness-and-health)","there are many different types of fatigue, with some being more severe than others. For example, while you may not experience fatigue from sitting for long periods, it is common to have a ""feel-good"" effect from sitting for a long time. This can be due to a combination of your physical and emotional state (though, it is also possible that the feeling of relaxation, happiness, or contentment from sitting may lead to the body's ""fight or flight response"") or simply because you are more aware of how your body feels at any given moment.

In general, an increase in activity level can cause discomfort and pain. The most obvious signs of this include cramps, backaches, stomach pains, headache, or mild dizziness. Other symptoms include headaches, fatigue, muscle aches/pain, sleep problems, etc.

Causes of fatigue in MS\nAnswer: there are several factors that contribute to fatiguing. One factor, however, is likely the primary culprit. It is usually due to insufficient blood flow to your central nervous system, which leads to reduced blood circulation, slowed heart rate, and difficulty getting oxygen to all parts of your brain. While not as frequent as chronic fatigue syndrome, other factors like hypertension, alcoholism, eating disorders, and depression may make a person susceptible to falling asleep during workdays or getting too little exercise on a regular basis.

Other Causes of Fatigue In MS\nAnswer: a variety of medications, including anti-anxiety medications, mood stabilizers, antihistamines, sleeping pills, antibiotics, drugs used to treat certain conditions, and even over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen. Many people believe they do not need these medications or just take them as directed. A study by the National Institutes of Health showed that taking anti-anxiety medication as prescribed was associated with higher rates of daytime sleepiness, poor concentration, increased tolerance for alcohol, and increased risk of falls, but only if those prescriptions were taken on a daily basis. Similarly, drinking and smoking cigarettes seem to aggravate fatigue symptoms. Alcohol abuse, especially heavy drinking, can worsen insomnia and reduce concentration. Smoking can exacerbate MS symptoms by causing insomnia, making you feel tired or irritable. People who smoke are often unable to stay awake when their body's circadian clock does not work properly.

Other Causes Of Fatigue In MS\nAnswer: Some of the causes of MS fatigue are not so apparent.","1. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) – a chronic disease which may be caused by inflammation, infection or immune system problems. It is characterized by debilitating symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness that can last for years.


2. Multiple Sclerosis – an autoimmune disease associated with destruction of nerve cells within the brain and spinal cord causing neurological issues. The most common form is called relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. This type of MS has been linked to a number of other conditions including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Tourette Syndrome. These include postural tachycardia syndrome, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome (RLS), depression and anxiety, depression-like behaviours, cognitive decline, and visual loss, among others.

3. Fibromyalgia – this condition, also known as ""the body's own worst enemy"" is characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, swelling and stiffness in some areas of the body, especially those muscles that control digestion, bowel movements, sexual function, and movement. Although not quite as severe as MS/ CFS it is a serious illness and often leads to disability due to reduced mobility, restricted range of motion and difficulty chewing, swallowing and speaking. In addition fibromyalgia sufferers are at increased risk for depression, low self esteem, poor self care, lack of energy, headaches and irritability, insomnia, fatigue, high blood pressure, kidney failure, bone fragility, heart attacks, and cancer, among other things. As a result many patients with fibromyalgia develop suicidal thoughts, even death. They may use drugs like Prozac and Zoloft or try other treatments such as acupuncture, massage, herbs, chiropractic, homeopathy, vitamins, physical therapy, and prayer.

4. Fibrous Myofascial Pain Syndrome - this condition occurs when the tissues of the lower back are compressed under tightness and strain resulting from repetitive motions. Symptoms include chronic tension headaches, neck pain, shoulder pain, low back pain, arthritis, muscle aches and pains in different parts of the body, cramps in the groin area, painful muscles around the knee, knee sprain, and low back pain. Many patients report being unable to sit up straight. Another symptom of FMPS is numbness in one side of their bodies and tendons and tendons across the foot.

5. Osteoarthritis – this joint disorder develops in the joints of your knees, ankles, feet and hips. When you have osteoarthritis it"
93,Question: Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?\nAnswer:,"Many studies show that the disease is associated with sleep disturbances, including insomnia. The association between MS and sleep disorders was confirmed in a recent study by Drs. David Zinkon and Mark Darnall of Harvard Medical School.\n

Sleep issues are common in persons who have MS. It has been known for some time that poor quality sleep causes fatigue and cognitive decline as well as other health problems. When this happens, it's called sleep apnea (sleepiness). Some patients also experience an increased risk for dementia because they are less likely to fall asleep at night due to lack of restorative sleep.

A number of research groups have studied sleep patterns in MS patients. In one such study of 60 MS patients, researchers found no significant differences in the levels of polysomnography data compared to controls. However, when their results were graphed on an hourly basis (a standard measure of sleep quality) the difference became apparent.

The study showed that MS patients had significantly more total minutes of wakefulness than controls. Interestingly, when these same volunteers were presented with a series of visual stimuli, those with MS had significantly fewer hours of total wakefulness overall. And when they viewed pictures related to memory or thinking, such as faces or letters, the differences disappeared. These findings suggest that MS patients' sleep is being compromised by changes in their circadian rhythm rather than REM sleep restriction.

Another study by Drs. Darryl Biernat and Stephen Ostrander from University College London examined 65 individuals with MS and 70 healthy controls. They analyzed participants' ratings of physical symptoms, including pain and stiffness, after taking blood pressure, heart rate and temperature measurements. The results demonstrated that while both MS groups reported some degree of daily pain during the day, there appeared to be a greater amount of chronic pain among MS patients than controls. Those with MS tended to report greater daily pain at night (even though both groups slept very little) and to suffer more frequent headache attacks while awake. This suggests that many MS patients suffer from chronic, unexplained and/or severe pain which may have a negative impact on performance throughout the day and into the evening.

This kind of evidence indicates that MS patients may be suffering from chronic pain disorders that could negatively affect their ability to perform. Even if you do not believe that your MS may be causing any pain, you should still understand that it may interfere with your ability to function effectively on a daily basis. If your doctor has diagnosed you with MS but you are unable to get enough","Yes. We know that MS is associated with sleep disturbance, so it makes sense to look at this condition as a risk factor for memory problems.\r

Sleep disorders such as insomnia, which are common among older adults, can cause problems with attention and concentration; however, sleep problems may also play a role in the development of MS. For instance, one study found that poor sleep quality was an independent predictor of disease progression.\r

MS is usually diagnosed during early adulthood, when the symptoms are typically mild. At first, patients may be confused about what to do—they're not sure they have MS or why their MS doesn't go away. Some people get relief from medication, but some require more sophisticated treatment plans. One method used by physicians today is called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This approach involves identifying specific triggers for symptoms and addressing them through training. It's important that these strategies aren't limited to just focusing on how bad your life has been lately. This helps you understand the importance of staying positive and taking control of your life!\r

How Can Multiple Sclerosis Affect Your Health? \r

Multiple sclerosis affects each nerve cell differently. Symptoms vary depending upon where each nerve cell resides in the body.\r

When a nerve cell is damaged, pain, numbness, muscle weakness or other abnormal sensations occur. In addition, nerve cells often die. These processes result in symptoms like headaches, fatigue, dizziness, seizures, loss of balance and involuntary movements.\r

Treatment Options for Multiple Sclerosis \r

There are several ways to treat MS. Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments specifically designed to help improve symptoms in older adults. However, many doctors believe that these drugs could help reduce MS symptoms and function. The most effective options include medications that block the inflammation caused by the immune system, corticosteroids, which target the immune system, and physical exercise.\r

Medications That Block Inflammation \r

NSAIDs, commonly known as over-the-counter pain relievers, work by inhibiting prostaglandins, which stimulate the production of white blood cells, causing pain. They don't actually directly affect MS symptoms, since NSAID use isn't intended to relieve pain. They were developed decades ago as painkillers for arthritis.\r

However, studies suggest that over-the-counter NSAIDS may worsen myelin sheaths, which connect axons within neurons. When axons become","The answer is yes, although not as strongly as some believe. For the most part, it's a myth that MS causes sleep disturbances or even a bad night's sleep. There is a difference between people who don't get enough rest and those who are chronically sleep deprived. People with MS often report having difficulty getting enough time for the ""important"" things they need to do, such as work, study or socializing—even while their bodies still function normally. They may also have trouble initiating sleep at night when they really need it; they end up falling asleep more easily than usual. For many of these folks, there isn't much that can be done about it. But for others, it may be possible to control how long they spend awake and during the day. It will probably take a combination of education, behavior modification techniques (including medication), and therapies designed specifically for this group of people to help them feel better about their condition.

How much time should you have? This question has been asked from all over the world by patients and friends of people with MS. Here are a few guidelines: It is important to establish an acceptable standard of sleep for everyone involved. Ideally, one should try to cut down on nighttime activity if possible. Even if you're not working full-time, sleep needs should include adequate sleep for your body temperature and other vital functions, plus plenty of uninterrupted sleep. However, even if you don't have any difficulties with sleep, it helps if you are able to get enough rest. If you're going to bed early because you're sick or tired, consider taking naps throughout the day and at least once before you go to bed at night. That way, if you fall asleep very quickly after waking up, you'll wake up feeling refreshed again. Of course, you shouldn't use excessive amounts of sleep! You might want to start with three hours of sleep per night, but keep adding longer and shorter increments. Don't feel guilty if you need less time each evening than you did last week, or even in the morning before you've had breakfast. In fact, you could even reduce what you eat to try to achieve this goal. Most importantly, remember that you must make sure that you've got enough quality sleep for the day. One study suggests that an average adult with moderate MS sleeps between nine and ten hours a night. An earlier study found that most adults with moderate MS slept between six and seven hours a night. And an even larger study found that only 20 percent of adults with moderate MS slept","Yes, although it is not clear how much of the association can be explained by sleep apnea. There are two plausible explanations:1) The lack of oxygen or other nutrients that would allow brain cells to produce new neurons during sleep.2) Losses in nerve connections due to age-related damage to the brain. These losses can happen when the brain ages rapidly (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), but also more slowly, such as with Parkinson's disease. Both these types of memory loss may be associated with REM sleep, but we don't know yet whether they have a stronger effect on REM sleep than on nonREM sleep.

A study published in Neurology in 1998 looked at the effects of different sleep stages on Alzheimer's risk. It found that REM sleep was associated with lower Alzheimer's risk.3 In another article in Sleep Medicine Reviews, Coyle et al. showed that the risk of dementia increases with increasing REM sleep length.4 However, this research did not examine if REM sleep could explain why there was no significant relationship between multiple sclerosis and either sleeping problems or forgetting in older people. We think that REM sleep plays an important role in regulating circadian rhythms and maintaining homeostatic rhythms.

Another way of understanding what causes multiple sclerosis is through the process of neurogenesis. A person starts his/her own neural stem cell division after birth and continues this for many years until death. This allows young adult brains to become specialized neuronal structures while those aged 40 and over continue their development as immature synaptic connections. When I am writing my book, I will use this analogy as well as other sources. If I were to ask you which type of child you wanted to spend your life with, it would probably involve having a few children before you die because each has its unique needs and characteristics. On the other hand, since there isn't anything special about me, I might want to keep myself busy learning something new, just like one of your kids might do. After all, our lives are filled with opportunities to learn more about ourselves and others so it makes sense that learning would be an excellent thing to develop skills for. Many experts believe that learning stimulates growth and thus helps us mature mentally and physically as we grow older. In addition to stimulating growth and memory formation, learning provides us with positive reinforcement and motivation to work toward goals.5 So, if I knew that by doing my best work every day, my children would be better off than I am, then I would continue doing everything right until they turn 18.

There","The relationship between sleep, memory, and MS is complex. Studies indicate that sleep disturbances are a risk factor for MS; however, there is no clear link between these disorders and the frequency of daytime sleepiness, depression, or cognitive impairment [12]. In addition, there is some evidence from animal studies demonstrating that prolonged exposure to light can induce sleep-like behavior during REM sleep [13], which may be more common in patients with MS than in healthy controls. Additionally, a number of studies have suggested that sleep-wake cycle abnormalities may play a role in the pathogenesis of MS [14,15] and that circadian disruption may contribute to progression of the disease [16].

Q: What does the use of light therapy do for me?

A: Light therapy has been widely used as an adjunct treatment for chronic pain since its introduction by Drs. Stanley Levin and Donald Kollins. A large recent meta-analysis showed that it provided significant improvements over placebo in both short-term (1–3 months) and long-term (more than 5 years) follow up of persons with moderate-to-severe pain compared with sham acupuncture alone. [17] However, there are several limitations of this study. First, there were only three trials comparing light with other therapies, which limited the power of the data. Second, light therapy was administered at bedtime only. In many cases, the amount of light delivered per session was less than what would be required to achieve similar effects on daily functioning in non-MS patients. Third, while light therapy has proven effective in reducing pain and fatigue among participants receiving conventional anti-inflammatory treatments, there is still a paucity of available research examining the efficacy of light on chronic pain. Finally, although light therapy might provide short-term improvement, it seems unlikely that such short term outcomes would translate into sustained benefits over time or even that they would last a lifetime.

Q: How safe is light therapy?

A: There are very few long-term studies evaluating the safety of light therapy. It remains unclear how much short-term benefit light therapy provides compared to conventional treatment, but the potential harms associated with light therapy have not yet been adequately addressed. For example, it is possible that, like traditional analgesics, light may increase risks for cardiovascular events or trigger new attacks of inflammation. These risks should also be considered when prescribing light therapy to individuals who could potentially experience adverse reactions.

Q: Can I get relief without medication?

A: No. Light","The data does not indicate a relationship between sleep disorders, including MS, and memory or cognition. There may be some risk factors for both the disorder and the sleep disorders but there is no evidence that these are related.\r

\r


MS does cause daytime fatigue, which can have serious consequences; however, sleep disturbances and the inability to remember things do not seem to be associated with MS in later life. Sleep difficulties and memory problems are more common among older adults who suffer from other psychiatric conditions such as depression or anxiety disorders.\r

\r


In fact, many patients with MS also experience sleep disturbance symptoms, even though they do not have a specific diagnosis of MS.\r


Sleep problems and the lack of recollection of memories may result from a variety of reasons, including excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating, and poor recall of information during periods of wakefulness. Unfortunately, studies examining the causes of these problems are limited because so few participants have been evaluated using standard cognitive testing methods, resulting in underpowered studies (e.g., see [24]). In addition, clinical observations often fail to address the issue of the role of mood and personality changes in memory loss and the ability to retain information. Therefore, future research should investigate whether MS affects aspects of personality/psychological functioning in relation to memory impairment, focusing on possible mechanisms involving memory-related brain abnormalities and emotional regulation behaviors.\r

Sleeping disorders and memory impairment

Sleeping problems are one of the most common medical conditions for which research has been conducted on treatment. The two primary sources that have been used to examine this topic include studies using standard sleep tests such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index or the Stanford Sleepiness Scale and clinical trials of medications like melatonin and benzodiazepines (such as alprazolam) [2]. Although both approaches have their limitations, they do provide valuable information about the prevalence of symptoms and the extent to which these affect the ability to function. In particular, the more frequent occurrence of symptoms suggests that some underlying cause exists. To date, there is no evidence showing a causal relationship between multiple sclerosis and sleep disturbance, but several recent reviews suggest a possible association, including an article by Littman et al. [3] and another by Zimmet et al.[4]. A Cochrane review found a small positive effect of melatonin therapy for atypical MS on sleep disturbances in individuals who were taking medication [5], although a further study of the same population failed to show any benefit [6]. Although it is true that patients can be prescribed medications to treat insomnia, the authors note that many patients also suffer from other sleep disorders that may interfere with sleep, such as depression or anxiety. They conclude that insomnia does not seem to play a direct role in the development of MS, but rather contributes only indirectly to the disorder's progression through the CNS. This may indicate that the severity of the disease itself influences how well patients can tolerate sleep disturbance, making them susceptible to developing the condition. While numerous studies have shown no relationship between multiple sclerosis and sleep problems, it remains unclear whether the observed effects are due simply to the presence of MS or to the symptoms themselves. For example, some researchers believe that the risk of developing MS is related to the length of time a patient has suffered from the disease [7]; others have suggested that it is not the number of MS cases experienced that determines the course of the disease, but the frequency of relapses [8]. Nevertheless, a large meta-analysis examining data from over 40 studies reported a significantly increased incidence of insomnia and daytime sleepiness among those suffering from MS compared to healthy controls [9]. Although a causative link between MS and sleep disturbances cannot be ruled out, the findings should be interpreted cautiously. Because insomnia and daytime sleepiness are frequently co-morbid conditions, it may be","I have a lot of questions about this, so let me ask you one question.\r

Your doctor may recommend that you do not use a sleep aid for the duration of your MS. However, if you are able to tolerate it and feel good enough to perform your normal daily tasks, consider using one or more effective treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).\r

For example, CBT has been shown to reduce symptoms of insomnia. You can find a list of recommended therapies at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/. For information on treatment options for other conditions such as depression and anxiety, see our article ""MS Treatment Options,"" available from www.neurologyinfo.com.

Q: Do drugs with anticonvulsant properties help with my symptoms?\r

A: Yes, they might. See the section below entitled, ""Anticoagulants.""

The following medications, known collectively as anticonvulsants, can relieve some or all of the effects of MS, but do not cure it:

Azathioprine and carbamazepine;

Ativan (a carbamazepine derivative);

Chlordiazepoxide;

Clonidine (for nausea), prochlorperazine (for dizziness);

Cyproheptadine and chlorpheniramine;

Diflucan (and its derivatives);

Entacapone and chlorpheniramine;

Focalin, fluphenazine, fluconazole, levetiracetam;

Lopinavir (Zanaflex);

Mefloquine;

Minocycline;

Neurontin and its derivatives;

Nedocromil;

Orlistat (and its derivatives);

Pregabalin (or pemoline hydrochloride and tricyclic antidepressants);

Risperdal;

Rituximab (Adcetris);

Seroquel;

Selenium sulfate;

Sulfasalazine;

Voltaren Gelatin;

Yohimbine;

Zeolite; and

Other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, paracetamol, aspirin-like drugs","Yes. It is not unusual for those with MS to suffer from insomnia or forgetfulness. There are a number of factors that may lead these symptoms, such as the nature of the illness, age and sleep habits. The most common cause of chronic insomnia in MS patients is lack of adequate quality sleep. This can be due to difficulty falling asleep and excessive daytime napping. As previously mentioned, many studies show that the proportion of patients who cannot fall asleep during the night was over 50% in the late 1990s.1 In addition, there have been reports showing an increased incidence of sleep apnea among MS patients compared to healthy controls.2-4 Although no conclusive data are available on this issue, there appears to be a link between sleep apnea and MS.5-7 Some researchers suggest that excessive sleepiness in patients with MS may interfere with their ability to regulate their bodies' natural circadian rhythms and contribute to the development of disease.8-10

MS is known to be associated with the presence of a wide range of systemic disorders.11 These include myelin damage (which damages the myelin sheath around nerve fibers), fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, autoimmune diseases and several others.12 Therefore, it is important to discuss whether chronic sleep disturbance is related to the occurrence of a variety of clinical disorders and how they might affect one's functioning. Sleep disturbances also play a role in the pathophysiology of other conditions, including depression, diabetes mellitus and obesity.13,14 Additionally, it has been shown that certain types of sleep loss can impair cognitive function15,16 and that sleep deprivation can result in long-term negative consequences17,18 and even death19 at times.20,21 Despite being more prevalent than any other psychiatric disorder, it seems that most people do not understand why this condition exists. A few people may believe that the main reason people experience poor memory is because they spend too much time awake while driving. But although driving does make us feel sleepy, we do so in small amounts and we rarely miss a turn.22 While many people are aware that they need less sleep than they did 15 years ago, they still have trouble understanding what causes this phenomenon and what is the best strategy for improving our daily schedule of sleep.23 Understanding MS will help you understand how your own body functions and helps you better manage the disease. You'll learn: How to prevent and treat sleep disturbances

Why sleep patterns vary across individuals

How to change your life to keep up with today's","Multiple Sclerosis is a neurological disorder that affects the brain. It involves abnormal signals from nerve cells, which are responsible for controlling movement and sensation. People with MS also have damage to their central nervous system (CNS). The CNS can be affected by disease such as diabetes or Alzheimer's Disease. Symptoms of MS include changes in vision, balance, muscle tone, hearing and swallowing difficulties. Some MS patients may experience memory loss due to changes in synapses, the connections between neurons. Sleep problems are often found in people with MS. It is known that sleep disturbances are linked to some types of dementia.\n

Sleep Disorders - Sleep disorders cause most of these symptoms: poor sleeping quality; disturbed dreams and REM periods in which you do not feel awake after waking up; inability to fall asleep or remain asleep when your body is moving; difficulty falling asleep on its own; and difficulty staying asleep. These conditions are usually related to problems with how the nerves communicate. Poor sleep can affect memory, thinking, mood and physical function. A person who has trouble falling asleep at night might experience this problem more frequently than someone without sleep problems. One study found that 65% of people with MS had frequent nightmares about sleep problems, compared with 13% of those without the condition. Another study showed that 66% of people with MS experienced daytime drowsiness when they were tired but did not need rest. When we wake in the morning, our bodies release melatonin, which helps us sleep. This hormone controls many aspects of our circadian rhythm. If a person experiences nighttime fatigue during the day, he or she could develop a sleeping pattern that is similar to that of people with other sleep-disordered diseases such as narcolepsy. In addition, it appears that many people with MS experience sleep apnea during the course of their illness. Apnea occurs when the airways become narrowed, causing a sudden increase in breathing rate. Sometimes this leads to an unpleasant or even dangerous situation for the person. It is best not to attempt to enter an apartment if you hear any loud noises. If a person becomes restless while lying down, try standing up first, then lie down again. Sleeping patterns of people with MS are different from that of people with Parkinson's disease, which has less impact on their mental functioning and is also associated with sleep disorders. Sleep apnea is one example of a sleep disorder that is characterized by frequent episodes of shortness of breath during sleep. Other sleep disorders include insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), both of which are common"
94,Question: When will I start to feel better with multiple sclerosis?\nAnswer:,"Many people have multiple sclerosis. The earliest symptoms include fatigue, dizziness and a general lack of energy. People often report feeling tired or depressed at times but don't know why. These feelings usually go away within one month, however some may get worse if they are not properly treated. In the case of MS, treatment is mainly focused on controlling the symptoms. For more information about treatments for multiple sclerosis, please visit our Multiple Sclerosis Treatment page.","It's not a matter of when you're feeling better, but how you feel. The best way to think about it is this: When your brain and body are at their most vulnerable, you get the biggest benefits from a healthy lifestyle.\r

\r

So the key is finding out what makes you feel good. Once you know what causes you to feel bad, you can make changes in the things that trigger those feelings -- like eating healthy foods, exercising regularly, taking care of yourself, staying safe around people you don't trust, avoiding alcohol and tobacco -- all of which can help you feel better.\r

\r","As soon as you feel the side effects of MS at all. Your symptoms may improve in a few months after treatment and symptoms can also get worse over time, especially if you have chronic pain or are taking medication that reduces your immune system response. You should still be monitored closely by your doctor because they know how much of this medicine is needed, how long it lasts and if there is any risk of withdrawal symptoms. This medicine has been shown to help reduce some types of cancer too. Many people say they have had more energy and feel less tired than before they started treatment, but remember that this drug is very effective only for short periods of time (about 2 weeks). So don't expect a miraculous cure just like most doctors say! Ask your doctor about other options.

Q: Do you need to take your medicines every day?\nA: Yes, this is important for your health. It helps prevent your body from fighting off disease faster and prevents side effects. Ask your doctor about possible alternatives if you think you may need them. There are many different ways to use MS medications. Some may be used every single day, others maybe once or twice a week, and some may be taken only when certain conditions occur. These choices depend on what your particular condition is. Also, take into account the amount of time your doctor prescribes you each dose. You may find that a longer period of abstinence is required to work properly. For example, one person's problem might require a shorter remission period than another person's. It's up to your doctor to decide which option works best for you. If you're not sure, talk to your doctor.

Q: What happens if I miss doses? A: The way your medication works depends upon when it was first prescribed to you and what type of disease you have. However, if your dose hasn't been changed for several days while you continue using your MS medication, consult your doctor. He/she may ask for an explanation, so make sure you tell him/her your plan of action if the missed dose occurs. Always follow the directions on your prescription label for proper dosing.

Q: How do I get a refill? Answer: Consult your doctor right away if you have questions or problems finding a pharmacy near you. Or visit www.msdpharmacy.com.

Q: Why does my MS medication keep getting better? A: In order for this medicine to work as well as it does, it must stay on target for as long as possible","You are very likely to feel worse if you have MS. For example, as the disease progresses, your symptoms may become more severe and you may find yourself having difficulty with activities of daily living (e.g., walking). Many people can also experience mood changes such as depression or anxiety that worsen as their disease progresses. Because your symptoms might be worse without treatment, it's important to get started on a course of action right away. If you continue to experience worsening, talk with your doctor about whether your condition is improving or not.

How long does it take for MS to develop after my initial diagnosis?

MS develops slowly over many years. It usually takes between five to eight years from your first symptom onset and between 10 to 15 years from the time when symptoms begin.

Can I still carry around an old version of my MS?

Yes, but remember this fact: Your MS may go back in some cases. In other cases, the new MS may develop at a later age than the original MS.

What happens when I try to walk down stairs, drive cars, or do other tasks that require my balance?

If you have any sort of spinal cord injury, there may be problems that interfere with these activities. See your medical provider for advice about how best to manage your disability.","There's no easy answer. Your symptoms may improve, but it might be difficult for you to keep the same daily routine.

If you have had MS for at least 3 years and have not been treated, check out ""How To Stop MS.""","First, be sure you are getting enough sleep and that it is normal for you to have trouble sleeping. Also, try not to take any medications if you do not need them. It may help to watch your doctor's appointment in advance of the day when you can see him or her for a physical examination. If you think you are having worsening symptoms after taking these medicines, consult your physician immediately.


Q: My MS has been going on for nearly 12 years, but the symptoms haven't gotten worse since then. Is there anything that could make my disease even worse?\nAnother symptom of MS is fatigue. You may also notice other signs of problems such as feeling restless (feeling like you want to go somewhere) and difficulty concentrating.


A: The most common cause of fatigue in MS patients is decreased muscle tone. Many people think that MS causes their muscles to atrophy because they cannot train properly, but it doesn't work this way at all. In fact, many studies have shown that many MS patients who are receiving medication for their disease actually appear to improve their performance in tasks requiring strength, speed, balance and coordination, which may result from changes in the nerve fibers themselves.


As far as the rest of the symptoms, I'm afraid we still don't know much about them. There are no objective diagnostic tests available. The best thing to do is follow your own doctor's advice, and spend time with a health professional who specializes in this area to get more information. There may be some cases where it helps to do both.


Q: Can I get multiple sclerosis without getting treatment?\nYes, you can get multiple sclerosis without being treated! There are two ways to get MS; one is through an autoimmune attack caused by a specific virus called Sjogren's Syndrome (which occurs when the body attacks itself). This condition usually happens within the first few years of life, and can be extremely painful, especially if it comes on suddenly. Although this condition affects approximately 1/3 of all children born in the U.S., there are no known vaccines or treatments for this type of MS. Another type of MS, named autoantibodies (meaning they attack the immune system), is often triggered by certain types of infections. If your immune system is underactive due to infection, you might experience pain, itching and stiffness. While other types of MS can be treated successfully, many of us find our symptoms diminish over time.


If you have had severe flare-ups of MS symptoms","This depends on the treatment you receive. If you are receiving a combination of two or more therapies (eg, steroids), your symptoms may start to improve within several weeks after starting therapy. However, if you have only one therapy and your symptoms are severe, they can take longer to respond. It is not clear why this delay occurs but it is likely related to the fact that some medications work by changing how cells communicate with each other and thus affect how well the immune system treats them. As long as the medicine keeps working, the body will keep fighting off the disease. Treatment options For most people who want to stop MS medications completely, there are three main types of treatments available: anti-inflammatory drugs called immunosuppressants

antibiotics such as amoxicillin and penicillin

blood pressure medication called ACE inhibitors. The first four all require you to get regular blood tests before treatment starts and then every couple months afterward. After six weeks of taking these medicines, you should be able to resume doing normal activities. You might need to go back to your doctor for more frequent blood testing and follow-up appointments. People who have been diagnosed with HIV infection usually have their MS medication stopped right away once they've had a few weeks of undetectable viral levels in their blood. In rare cases, medications used to treat certain cancers may cause problems. These include chemotherapy drugs like temozolomide, carboplatin and cyclophosphamide, which may slow down or stop the healing process. A blood test showing a low level of antibodies against cancer-causing genes might also prompt an early discontinuation of a particular drug. Another option is to switch from one type of immunotherapy drug to another (such as an antibody called MOG-1). While MOG-1 isn't approved for use in the US, it's widely available in Europe. Because MOG-1 doesn't interfere with the functioning of the immune system, most doctors recommend switching over when the new version appears to be safer than the old one. Other drugs may make it harder for you to eat, drink or sleep, so talk to your doctor about possible alternatives. Your doctor probably won't recommend stopping most of the different therapies until you're no longer sick, because a change in medication could lead to serious side effects. Also keep in mind that medicines taken for an extended period of time can impact your ability to control weight and may increase your risk of osteoporosis, heart attack, stroke and diabetes. So even though you may find relief","If you are still having problems with your legs, you may have a few months until you can walk again.

Q: What should I do if my mother is experiencing early MS symptoms after she has had three children?

A: You need to see your doctor immediately. Your mom might be suffering from a neurological problem that has yet to be diagnosed because she hasn't been tested for MS or other diseases that could trigger her symptoms. There's nothing wrong with her health, but the first step in addressing these issues is to ask for help.

For example, if your mother has been taking a high dose of corticosteroids (which can cause muscle pain), then she has an increased risk of developing late-onset MS symptoms after pregnancy. She needs to stop all medications before delivery. Other things you can try include getting regular checkups as soon as possible so your doctor knows what's happening and why you're not responding as well to treatment.

Q: Should I get blood tests for my daughter when she's younger than 5 years old?

A: Not unless you know the test results are normal. The risks associated with older blood tests can be dangerous for young people who don't understand their consequences, such as the increased chance of heart disease and stroke. To protect yourself and your child, talk to your pediatrician about any concerns related to blood testing.

Q: How does one avoid contracting HIV while being infected by another person?

A: Do your best to keep your sexual partners healthy. It's important to stay sexually active in order to maintain a low viral load. A viral load level between 100 and 150 copies per milliliter (cpml) indicates no infections were detected and therefore there was no exposure to HIV. That means that no transmission occurred; however, infection with HIV is still considered HIV-infection even though it didn't result in any physical damage or impairment. Keep in mind that being infected with HIV is not the same as contracting it through sex. This may sound confusing because HIV and AIDS share similar terms, but both relate to a condition where someone becomes sick from a virus. So, knowing which kind of HIV is most likely to affect you is helpful because it helps you decide whether or not you want to continue engaging in sexual activity that exposes you to this potentially life threatening virus.

The following chart provides an overview of some key aspects of HIV.","You have a few years.

In the early stages of MS, the symptoms may not be noticeable, and you might think they don't matter. After several months or years, however, your brain's memory can begin to slip, and you'll notice many things about yourself that are odd, unusual, or just plain weird. Your eyesight, for example, won't function as it should because of blurry vision; you may find that you need glasses even when you're wearing contacts. If you can remember what you ate yesterday, why didn't you eat anything last night, or how did you get there from where you were going yesterday—you've experienced some form of visual impairment in an MS patient before. This is called progressive degeneration (PD) dementia. PD does not necessarily mean that you will experience any loss of vision. In fact, most people who develop PD do not lose their sight completely, but simply suffer from blurred vision and/or other cognitive impairments.

It's important to note that not everyone who experiences these cognitive impairments will develop PD dementia. Some people with PD don't develop it at all. For example, someone with PD who has only had mild signs of disease (such as fatigue or low-grade fever) over the past several weeks doesn't appear to suffer from any serious symptoms during this period. On the other hand, those with a more severe neurological problem such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease, or Huntington's disease will often develop PD dementia later on, especially if they also have a history of infections in their digestive tract or blood vessels. People who develop PD dementia should always consult a doctor because PD may require surgery to remove some portions of the nervous system. Also, if you suddenly experience significant problems with your vision, such as seeing very small objects or being unable to make eye contact, be sure to see a doctor right away!

How Can I Know My Symptoms Are Related To Multiple Sclerosis?

If you notice changes in your daily life that aren't related to symptoms of MS, it's likely that your mind isn't processing them correctly. Sometimes people don't realize they are experiencing changes until years after they first noticed them, which may lead to further confusion and difficulty in tracking down the cause of your problems. It's also possible that the symptoms are unrelated to MS, but just seem strange at the time because they haven't been treated properly by your health care provider. For example, someone with","You may experience some improvement in your MS symptoms when you get the treatment. But you should not stop taking treatment. Your doctor can help you decide if it is worth taking or not.

What are my options for treatment after the first dose of a new medication?

Ask about what other treatments might be available in our MS Treatment Center where we can discuss options and provide guidance on treatment recommendations. There are many medications available that have been studied, but none are FDA-approved for MS. There are several different types of anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and others. These have specific side effects that require monitoring. Aspirin has been used for many years as an effective alternative to NSAIDs and is no longer recommended. Other types of painkillers are available to treat MS. Check with your healthcare provider before starting these medications so he/she knows how much to prescribe. If your MS is severe enough to affect your ability to drive, your physician might consider prescribing pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol). For chronic conditions like cancer and heart disease, there are also non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDS) and non-steroidal anti-depressants (NDRs).

How does treating MS improve quality of life?

When people who have MS are treated with medicines, they usually become more active and able to function at their normal levels. This means they can spend more time doing things they enjoy. In addition, MS patients often notice improvements in their mood, energy level and overall well-being. Many MS patients do not realize that their condition has improved until they take another prescription medicine or go on a walk. It's important to remember that improving one's health means making choices to make themselves healthier, which can include changing diet, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep and eating foods high in whole grains, fruits and vegetables. The benefits of treatment for MS go beyond just being symptom free—it changes a person's outlook on life, helps them live longer, makes them more productive and improves their quality of life."

The line ends with a dashed line (which is also sometimes called an ""exclamation mark"") when you've gotten so far that there is no more information to provide. For example, if you want to find out how many times we used the word ""one,"" type 'Q1.' If you don't have any additional input after Q1, it'll say something like 'Q2,' which is the same thing except that you didn't get anywhere near the end of your list and have to try again. Also note that if you hit enter, the '0' will automatically indicate the first time you typed the answer into a box.","I would have to say that I read the book from cover-to-cover, and it's a very well written work. The book is very easy to understand; it's not dense with technical jargon and difficult concepts.The main point of the book was to discuss various problems which people come up against when using MS Word (or Microsoft Excel) on their computers. For instance, there are many people who have trouble with word processing software such as Microsoft Office Writer or WordPerfect, but they find that they can't do anything with them because they don't use an editor for those programs.This is often the case because of what most people refer to as ""the old way"", where you type things into the computer, then save them as files. This method does sometimes allow some flexibility, since you can edit the text at any time after you've typed it, but this is rarely useful unless you're editing large amounts of text.If you want to be able to easily get a text file from your printer (for example), you might make one out of simple words and phrases. If you keep the filename for each line as long as it needs to be, you can create all kinds of documents on paper using just plain old letters, numbers, punctuation marks and other basic symbols.One thing I found really helpful was the section about the different types of fonts, and how they affect the way a document looks like, especially if we want to display different types of characters.In addition, the information provided in the book helped me figure out a few of my own issues with using Word and Excel. For instance, I started to think that I should switch back to using plain text formatting, but I quickly discovered that I didn't care so much about having separate pages for every single type of character, as long as I could always write something down and have it look correct.For more details about the subject matter covered in the book, visit http://www.w2i.com/products/msword

However, because of how long it is and the number of words, there are some hard-to-read passages that require concentration to read. The best way is to simply read as fast as possible until your eyes get tired or the words start to blur.

In my opinion, it's not worth reading more than one chapter at a time, since you're likely to run out of time by then.


I recommend checking out the rest of the books on this list. You'll be glad you did!","I don't think that's true. When you see a question, it looks like you read the answer to it! :)

I am sure you have heard of this, but Microsoft Word cannot open PDF files (like.doc or.xls format) as it doesn't support them. You need to use another application such as Adobe Reader (which has both a text and pdf file support). It is important to note that some documents may require other programs such as Acrobat for saving or printing.


Question: I'm having trouble opening the word document at all. Is there any way that I can fix my problem?

Answer: First of all you must understand how Microsoft Word works. As a matter of fact, it is much harder to edit words than photos or images. So if you want to edit your own words, make sure you keep all the formatting intact. Also remember that words are made up of many small letters. So the first thing you must do is write down what each letter stands for before writing anything else. This means that in order to change what a word stands for, you will need to find the place where a specific letter is written on the page (such as 'a' when referring to the A-word). If you look closely at the picture above you will notice that the second A-word appears after 'a'. However this does not mean that you need to add that letter in front of the word 'A', however this would be better than changing the whole letter altogether. Now we are going to take a look at how Microsoft Word deals with different types of pages. Some of these pages are very simple while others are quite difficult. Let's start by looking at this example.


If you were to go back into Word and type ""a"" instead of simply typing it, Word would display your input correctly. Therefore, if you were to type ""a"" without using a space between the two letters, then there would still be nothing on the screen because the space would just disappear. However, if you try to enter the same letter in this manner, Word will also treat your input correctly. For example, if you typed the word ""a"" with a period between it and ""a"", Word would not interpret that as ""a"".","The following is a complete listing of all known solutions for this problem.

Solution:

There are six possible ways to solve the problem, but only three are correct:

Using an array as the solution (which creates a new array). This produces the same results but with much fewer memory allocations. Using an array and a pointer to it. Which will use twice as many allocs as using an array directly. That means that if your program uses pointers you must allocate them before every operation. Doing nothing. Which will create as many allocs as the first two options, even more than that when doing nothing.

As far as I know there are no other answers for this question.

The answer is obviously that everything should be done with arrays!

This may seem like cheating, but it's not. When we write code we often have to think about how something works in isolation from its context (whether it's a function or data structure) so we can make better decisions about what elements should be allocated based on their particular needs. We're making choices because we want to do things properly; if they were independent and left us free to choose without regard to context, we'd just put everything together and get rid of things as soon as we saw fit.

I guess we shouldn't stop there though...","MS Word is my main tool. I have a few problems with Microsoft Word, and I'd like to get rid of them. What do you suggest?

A: In this case, the only thing that might work is to remove all references to ""Microsoft"" from your system files. To do so, you can use this command at a Windows command prompt:

bcdedit /set {default} DisableAllWindowsCodes True bcdedit /set {default} EnableAllWindowsCodes True

The two commands above will tell Windows about the default setting for each type of document and set it to true (or false) for both Windows 2000 and XP. If you want to keep using other versions, just copy over the appropriate one. The instructions below assume that you are running Windows 2000 or 2003. You should note, however, that there's no guarantee that any particular version will behave the same way in the future.

Beware: Be careful when removing these settings because if they're not removed, those files may later be reinstalled again when someone else tries to edit them. There are some good reasons why you shouldn't delete documents. Here are a couple of examples:

The file has been modified by somebody else in a way that makes the changes permanent. This could happen when you update something on your computer; especially if you've updated the.EXE,.MSI, or even.COM files (which might contain security holes); or if somebody takes ownership of the file (for example, by adding a new owner to the group). These kinds of things happen often enough that you should leave these files alone. However, if you really need to make certain that your files aren't deleted permanently, you should probably create a backup first (as described later in this topic), which requires that you know what permissions your users have on the files (either through Group Policy or an account-based password system such as Active Directory Domain Services).

You have an older version of the software installed. By default, newer versions (such as those available from the Internet) come preinstalled on most computers. If you install the old version, then you must run the installation process again, usually after you upgrade to the latest version of the program.

96,Question: most efficient and sustainable diets\nAnswer:,"The key is to make sure the food you eat provides all of your daily needs, not just the protein or fat you're used to eating.

I know you have been doing a lot of research lately so I thought we would talk about something that has come up over on Reddit. A lot of people are thinking about switching to Paleo (or other diet) for health reasons and they've found it very difficult to follow their old plans because they find themselves eating too many foods from the grocery store. Some people are going in and buying all sorts of new stuff with hopes of making them feel better, but it's kind of like trying to change your mind after having an affair: once you start eating that way, there's nothing stopping you! There isn't really any real evidence to back it up. Here are some links to some questions and answers related to this topic: What are my options for healthy nutrition? Paleo is the only ""natural"" diet/diet plan that's guaranteed to help your body grow. It works wonders for weight loss, hair growth, general well-being, and overall vitality. Can I do this without sacrificing quality? No. In fact, if you want good health, you'll need to improve the quality of the foods you eat. Do my kids need to stay home from school or work? Yes. For kids under 14 years old, most schools require your child to be home by 9pm, which means they will often eat before or while school starts. This makes working out a bit more challenging, and may cause your kids to burn off excess energy at bedtime instead of staying active throughout the day. Is there anything wrong with regular exercise? Not at all. If you can keep yourself fit, then exercising every single day won't hurt. Even if you don't exercise, keeping your blood pressure below 140 will help you lose weight quickly and effectively without the added strain. But even for us adults who aren't overly concerned with being in shape, moderate levels of physical activity can keep your blood pressure low enough that you can actually maintain your weight. Are there really no limits? Nope. Just as long as you limit what you consume, you should also avoid restricting calories, because your body produces more than enough glucose and insulin when you're burning fat and carbs together. How does fasting affect my health? Generally speaking, you shouldn't get into trouble by skipping meals. That said, some researchers think that certain foods such as red meat, nuts, and sugar may raise blood pressure and cholesterol. So if you","this is a subjective question, but the general consensus of scientists seems to be that the best diet for weight loss should involve low-carbohydrate (LCHF) or ketogenic (KD). Ketosis should also play an important role in helping you lose fat.

Q: how do I eat to burn more calories? A: If you want to burn more calories than what you would normally expend in any given day, it's very simple: keep your food intake relatively low; eat fewer calories when you're hungry. (For example, if you're eating breakfast at 5am then eat no more than 2,000 calories throughout the day.)

What are the benefits of LCHF? For some people, consuming less energy means they can eat fewer calories overall. It may even give them more control over their weight, as well as more time to enjoy life. Other types of dietary strategies include the use of probiotics, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium supplements, and exercise, which help improve insulin sensitivity, blood glucose levels, and lower body mass index (BMI), among other health benefits.","all diets are very effective at creating an energy balance within the body, so it is important that you make sure that each food has a variety of nutrients. You should aim for 100% fresh fruit or vegetables every day to provide your body with essential vitamins (B6, B12, C), minerals (calcium, magnesium and iron).

How do I get started?

As long as you're eating healthy and getting enough nutrients daily, then there's no need for extra exercise or anything like this! The only thing you really have to think about is how often you eat. If you start off with something small then increase your intake over time to see if it helps you lose weight. Once you've reached your goals you can either drop calories down and focus on gaining muscle or just cut them out completely!","I don't have a definitive answer. The first thing that comes to mind is the concept of energy balance, which suggests that all calories are equal. Another factor you might consider is calorie density, which suggests that certain foods provide more nutrients than others (e.g., meats, vegetables, fruits).

I think that there's no single ""best"" diet. In fact, it seems almost impossible to find one. It could be any combination of those two factors, as well as other things like what you're eating and how much stress you're under. But if you were going by calorie numbers alone, your best bet would probably be to eat at least 2-3 times per week, depending on your activity level.","a) raw meat, b) whole grains (except white), c) organic vegetables, d) omega 3's.

I think the above is enough information to give you an idea of what I'm talking about and hopefully that will help you get started on your own nutrition plan. My goal for this article was simply to put some thoughts together as well as provide you with all of the resources needed to make it happen!","it depends on your level of hunger, how much you eat and the time you have to work. Most people lose weight faster with a healthy diet than an unhealthy one, but some gain in size.

A couple more points...

The people who have had the best success with low carbohydrate diets include those doing it because they are obese (as opposed to having health issues due to diabetes) and/or have other medical conditions like heart disease, high blood pressure or cancer. There is no specific diet recommended for every single individual, so you need to do your research and figure out what works best for you. Many of the foods that people suggest as low-carb are actually quite ""moderate"" in carbohydrate content. They are usually not very hard on the body and may even help with weight loss. For example, whole grains contain fiber which helps absorb excess calories and prevent cravings for sweets. The same is true with fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans and legumes.

For many years, Dr. Michael Eades' Low Carb Diets work was considered by many to be the gold standard of healthy eating by the public and by doctors. In my opinion, his diet is an excellent starting point - especially if you've already been overweight or obese. But it's very expensive and does come with a lot of restrictions. So there is certainly something to be said about using common sense when shopping around. Remember that you will likely get better results if you follow a lower carb diet first. If you are still concerned about your health and want to make sure you stay within the guidelines of a health care provider, talk to a nutritionist who specializes in the area you are working with.

In addition, you also need to consider the cost of the food itself. It can be a bit confusing because low-carb recipes often call for ingredients such as butter, egg whites, cream cheese, sour cream, oil, etc. While these items are part of the traditional high carbohydrate diet, they were added to our diets for reasons unrelated to helping us lose weight. Some of these items might even increase the amount of fat you consume. These items should not be eaten on their own, but rather combined with a nutritious low-fat meal. A protein supplement such as whey proteins or eggs can go along with a good fat source - such as coconut milk or avocado oil - which has the proper ratio of calories to carbohydrates.

Lastly, you must remember that each person's body responds differently to different types of carbs. Each person reacts differently to","It depends. There are two basic ways of eating a healthy diet. The first is to eat mainly fruits, vegetables, whole grains (brown rice), legumes, nuts, seeds, etc. This means that you should avoid red meat, fish, cheese, eggs, butter, sugary foods, sugar-sweetened beverages, dairy products, animal fats, and other processed foods.

The second way is to consume more fruits, vegetables, whole grain, nuts, seeds, beans, and whole milk powder than the average person consumes in one year. This means that you need to consume about 200 grams less per day.

For example if your total caloric intake was 1000 calories per day then it would be better for you to have only 2200 calories in your body weight than 10 grams less in body weight. If you want to lose weight faster then you should aim for having 100 grams of fat per day.


How much weight can I lose?

Weight loss from 5% to 10% is possible depending on your calorie consumption. Weight loss from 10% to 20% requires 1.5 times as many calories.

To lose weight fast you should try to consume about 400 kilojoules per day or 200 kcal/kg of fat per day. Keep this constant throughout the day until you reach your goal weight. You could even use a scale while counting calories. In order to increase your metabolic rate by 20%, you must burn an additional 30 kJ/kg of fat per day!

Do you think that all fats belong in the same category?

There is some controversy regarding whether to classify all saturated and trans fats differently. Some studies show that these fats are not harmful but others shows them as being very dangerous for our health. We will discuss those findings later when we talk about how best to cut down your food intake.

Are there any side effects when you use dietary supplements?

Most people do not notice any adverse effects associated with their diet supplement use. However, supplementing with omega 3 fatty acids may cause intestinal bleeding and liver damage which can lead to death. People taking omega 6 fatty acid supplements might develop skin rashes, stomach ulcers, diarrhea, and fatigue due to excessive absorption of vitamin D3. Many people also experience allergic reactions. A few reports indicate that people using diuretics may get kidney problems.","I think if you go to a natural food store, they'll sell you a lot of different stuff. You can get an entire plant based diet for $2 or less. And then some people do get really strict on it by limiting their carbs and protein, but that's not what we want in our body as humans. We have to be able to break down the foods we eat into smaller components.

If you've ever eaten at a restaurant where you had a big portion of meat or dairy, that was a mistake because you just ate too much meat or dairy. That's what your brain does when there isn't enough energy for everything else. Your brain works off protein and fat (and water) to keep you alive. If you're eating lots of sugar, those are going to make it hard for you to keep up with all the other needs. So let's look at what's actually healthy for us to consume:

Fats – The fats in food are our first line of defense against inflammation. If you were to take away all fats from the diet, your cells would start making inflammatory molecules called cytokines which promote inflammation. This is why saturated fat is so bad for you. It turns out that omega-3s like DHA and EPA are even worse than saturated fatty acids in this regard and may be even more important for maintaining good health. They also help reduce inflammation because they lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, so having high amounts of these types of fats in your system makes sense, especially if you're trying to maintain a balanced nutrient intake. Some research has shown that supplementation with the type of fish oil found in soy milk may protect against cardiovascular disease and cancer.

Vitamins and Minerals – Vitamin B12 plays a huge role in the human immune system. People with poor circulation problems tend to have trouble absorbing vitamin B12 and need to drink plenty of water throughout the day. Vitamins C and E both play a role in helping to prevent muscle loss due to aging and illness. Fish oils contain niacin and B6 which act as antioxidants and help to repair DNA. These nutrients also support normal digestive function, so consuming enough should improve health overall. A number of studies have linked the consumption of fish to reduced risk of heart attack and stroke.

Phosphorus – Phosphorous is another very important mineral. Without adequate phosphorus in your body, you cannot synthesize proteins nor absorb essential vitamins and minerals like calcium. In fact, your kidneys can only process around 3 grams of phosphorus","yes, the best diet for you!

Q: Why do I get fat?A: your body needs to burn energy during exercise. The faster that it burns calories, the more muscle mass you will have!\nFor example, if you are running an 8 miles a day at 60mph, every 15 minutes your metabolism will be burning around 1,000 calories, which equals 4lbs of fat each week. If this is not enough to keep you full until bedtime, then you should increase your calorie intake!The only way to lose fat without starving yourself is by eating well and exercising!\nThat's why people don't eat anything but vegetables when they are working out, because it keeps their metabolisms going. Even some athletes who are not active have a good amount of protein in their meals so they can recover quickly after heavy workouts and continue training.\nIf you want to look bigger, then you need to gain weight. But, if you're skinny then losing weight isn't easy...So, eat lots of healthy foods. Keep them low on sugar, high in proteins and low in fats. And, take care of your skin too!\nWhen eating healthy food, try to keep all the ingredients as simple as possible. A little water helps to dilute the taste of the food, so make sure it doesn't taste bad! Also, avoid processed meats or any other unhealthy products. You need to use your imagination. Try new things every now and then. When eating fresh fruit, choose small amounts to see how much you get. If you consume large quantities of sweeteners, then you may find that the sweetness gets diluted in your stomach. Sometimes there's nothing wrong with simply drinking fruit juice and enjoying the flavor it gives.\nAlso, never add salt to your food. It makes you feel bloated and weak, not healthier. To help to digest all the nutrients in food (carbohydrates and fiber), eat slowly and break up big chunks. Don't overconsume, but don't overeat either. When you have plenty of food, you won't notice any difference between eating two meals and one meal.\nFinally, remember that not everything you eat has to be healthy. You can still eat junk food or even snacks (a lot like candy) to fill up your belly and get away from your diet. Just remember what we said before about getting rid of sugar! We didn't say to drink soda. \nSometimes eating healthy is hard, especially if you are struggling with"
97,Question: benefits of physical activity\nAnswer:,"physical activity is important for your health and well being, and it can help prevent many common ailments. It's not just about getting up in the morning to get moving - that doesn't necessarily mean you need to stay in bed until 9am each day. Physical exercise will also keep your blood pressure lower than without it and improve your overall metabolism. There are various types of physical activities such as running, biking or swimming. For those who do not have much time or money (or both), there are plenty of free physical activities available on the web (such as these free fitness apps).

Another question from a reader asks if it would be better to drink water before eating. The answer is no - drinking more water does not increase weight gain. Drinking 1 litre of water every hour for two days after having had an energy-enhancing meal could actually make you fatter! But the reason is that the extra fluid needs to go into your stomach and intestines, so some of the excess fluids will end up in your stomach. It is recommended that people with weak digestive systems drink 2 litres per 24 hours to avoid this problem. If you don't have strong digestion then you will end up consuming more calories, and therefore you may end up gaining weight too. That said, it might be best to eat something like pasta with green peas, which are higher in fibre (and thus healthy!) than other similar foods.

A final question asked whether we should take more vitamin D pills than we already use. This comes from someone who has been taking 500mcg/day (500 micrograms) of synthetic vitamin D3 since 2012, even though he still needs to supplement his diet. He recommends that we consume 1500mg (1400mcg) a day (1500mcg equals 1.5 milligrams of Vitamin K2). A 2000 mcg dose of vitamin D3 taken once a week would be equivalent to taking 3000mcg.

Some other comments

The above information was written by Dr Michael Mosley, Professor of Clinical Nutrition at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK. We are grateful to all of our readers for sharing their experiences with us and for helping us promote good nutrition. You can view more of Dr Mosley's work through www.mosleyshowto.com and follow him on Twitter @DrMoser1","The average person gets about 100 million steps a day.

This is about how many calories one can burn just walking around for an hour or two at a time, not counting the time taken to get from place to place. (For example, you might walk 30 minutes and then exercise for another 10 minutes.) That means it takes only 5,000 calories to replace those 5,000 steps with a calorie-burning session in your own house.

So if you were to run 4 miles for a full week, you would need to eat roughly 1,200 more calories to fuel that exercise than the amount you burned doing that jog. And that's assuming you didn't have any other activities, like watching TV or taking naps during the week. (If you do, that number might be higher.) But as you'll see below, there are plenty of ways to get your body burning a lot more calories through regular exercise without having to rely on fast food — or even being overweight.","There are many good reasons why people should work out, but most of them don't have to do it all the time.

Physical exercise can help you build muscles and improve your health in a variety of ways. However, getting enough rest is probably the best way to maintain this effect. If you're trying to lose weight or develop muscle mass, you'll need plenty of sleep.

There's no doubt that if you're overweight, your body needs some time to adapt to living on fat. So even though physical activity might not be the answer for everyone (and certainly doesn't guarantee they will lose weight), there's no reason not to take advantage of the opportunity.","a good diet, exercise and good sleep will help your body adapt to the stress

Physical activity has many different beneficial effects on our health. It's important to understand that all these things are not necessarily present in one specific type or level. Physical activity is just one component of a healthy lifestyle. The other components can include:

Nutritional and metabolic factors such as dietary intake (which includes a variety of foods)

Environmental factors like air pollution, smoke, light, noise and sunlight exposure

The quality and quantity of sleep we get and how much rest we need throughout the day.

Question: Does exercise make you feel better? Answer: Yes. Exercise releases endorphins which helps with anxiety and depression, but does not seem to do anything else. It is believed to have been the reason why people who exercised found it easier to get off their feet after they had just walked for an hour.


Question: How can I start exercising? Answer: Start by getting out there and taking some walks every day. Just be sure you are walking at least 20 minutes a day, or going as far away from home as possible (do this by bicycle if you must). After each walk, go outside, take a deep breath, look around, talk to someone (if you want) then try again. If you still don't feel like you are doing much, stay inside for a bit, drink a few water and go back out into the sun. At first it may seem difficult to get into it, but once you do it will become second nature. Get started now!


Question: Is there any way to make exercise so easy that people can do it without even thinking about it? Answer: No. The answer lies somewhere between two extremes - one extreme is that we are born with our bodies programmed to respond to external stimuli, such as our environment, our surroundings and other living creatures; another extreme is that our body is programmed to self-regulate itself based on internal cues. For example, when we are hungry, our brain signals to our muscles to pump blood to our stomach, causing us to eat something immediately. Similarly, when our heart beats too fast or starts beating irregularly, our body signals these changes to our muscles through contractions, leading them to tense up. In short, all the important cues to exercise are stored within our genes and are passed down from generation to generation. But, in order for exercise to work, we need to know how to use them properly.","Yes

Interviewer: What is the most important thing that you learned from this study, and what can we learn from it?


Dr. Peter Attia: This study was very interesting, because it showed that there are many different effects in different people when they choose to exercise or to lose weight. For example, we know that people who are obese are more likely to be overweight later on in life. So, if you're obese now and you decide to reduce the amount of fat you've accumulated over the years, chances are that that will help your health in the future as well. And we know, for instance, that physical activity increases HDL cholesterol levels and lowers LDL cholesterol levels, so lowering those two risk factors improves the overall cardiovascular risk profile. As well, there's evidence that moderate alcohol consumption decreases risk of coronary heart disease. So, while these studies all point towards an association between obesity and cardiovascular problems, how much impact each one has depends largely on which type of diet they follow, and at what age. A healthy adult who eats a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet can still be overweight later on if he decides to increase his calorie intake during adulthood, whereas someone with metabolic syndrome (type 2 diabetes) might gain weight earlier than someone without such conditions. It's important to emphasize that there isn't a clear ""right"" or ""wrong way"" to change diet; instead, it turns out that the optimal lifestyle may vary depending on which type of diet the person follows, which part of the body changes, and whether the goal is to burn fat or muscle. In other words, there isn't just one right way of doing things! Also, note that although BMI and BMI categories were used to classify individuals into categories, there are many ways to describe them. For example, an individual classified as underweight may actually be a bit heavier than average, based on the fact that their body mass index is lower than average. The","A: Physical exercise helps to build bones, muscle and connective tissue. It also provides important antioxidant nutrients for the body and improves immunity (which can reduce inflammation), blood sugar levels and lowers cholesterol.

Physical activity helps to prevent cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, and it may lower cholesterol levels. In addition, a brisk walk or jog five days per week can reduce risk of cancer. And while moderate-intensity exercise such as jogging has no effect on blood pressure, an extra 15 minutes of vigorous walking three times a week decreases blood pressure by about 1/3, according to the National Institutes of Health.

According to the CDC, exercise reduces death rate from heart attacks, strokes and certain cancers (such as breast and prostate). But even if you don't think you're physically active, try making healthier choices. For example, avoid eating fast foods because they might increase your chance of being overweight. It's also worth exercising at least 10 percent of the time. That could mean going for a run or yoga class before dinner each night instead of taking a nap after watching TV.","The health of your bones and muscles are important to you, especially if you have a history of osteoporosis. Exercise helps prevent bone loss and strengthens the tissues in your body that support strong bones.*

98,Question: most common complications in pregnancy\nAnswer:,"If you experience any of the following symptoms during your pregnancy, contact a healthcare provider immediately for immediate medical assistance. (Please note that these symptoms may be accompanied by other signs and symptoms which also warrant an appointment with a health care professional):

Fever

Severe headache

Fatigue

Nausea

Vomiting

Chest pain or discomfort

Migraines

Abdominal cramps

High blood pressure

Seizures

Low blood sugar levels

Tremors

Athletic problems (e.g., difficulty walking)

Difficulty swallowing

Diarrhea

Injury to the uterus or fetus

When should I see my doctor?

It's important to call your doctor if you experience any of the following:

Sudden bleeding at any time during your pregnancy

Painful or difficult labor

Birth defects, including deformities such as severe heart problems, preterm birth, and a low birth weight

Blood clots in the brain or spinal cord

Heart attack

Kidney stones

Symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cramping, or loss of appetite

These symptoms can indicate serious conditions like miscarriage or stillbirth, but they're not always caused by a medical condition. If it seems you might need further evaluation, have your regular visit scheduled with your primary care physician.","Abdominal pain, hemorrhoids

What should I do if I am worried about miscarriage?

If you are concerned that your baby may be miscarrying – or even have gone into premature labor – don't panic. You can talk to your doctor or a lactation consultant for advice.

The good news is that miscarriages are quite rare and only occur when there's something wrong with the lining of your uterus (a tear). Sometimes doctors mistakenly think an ectopic pregnancy has occurred or that it might be possible to conceive again after the birth of a stillborn infant. But these miscarriages are not usually due to abnormalities in the uterus and aren't always life-threatening. If you're experiencing severe abdominal pain in the first two weeks postpartum, call your midwife right away, even if you're already pregnant. If symptoms worsen as you get closer to term, call 9-1-1 immediately.","any complication that will cause the baby to be born prematurely, or with a low birth weight (usually premature delivery).

What happens after birth?

After giving birth, you'll have some time to relax. You'll need to rest for up to 24 hours, and then your body will begin producing hormones. Your uterus is like a muscle; it helps control blood flow around your baby, which could lead to more bleeding if there's too much pressure on your baby during the birth process. During the first few days after delivery, your body will also release endorphins, an over-the-counter painkiller. These substances help make you feel better so that you can go back to work or school.

Your doctor may suggest other treatments that could improve your quality of life while you're recovering. You might try acupuncture, massage therapy, chiropractic manipulation, antihistamines, or even homeopathic remedies. They all increase blood circulation and keep your body healthy enough for a normal pregnancy.","1) high blood pressure and 2) preterm birth \/ n=1=2, and 3) high-risk pregnancy \n Answer: 1) high risk of prematurity (3rd or 4th trimester)

Let's have a look at each.


The problem with the Baby

In most cases, if you can keep your baby healthy, it will go on to be one happy child. But there are some that suffer from complications like infections or ear damage. As for the mothers, there are various reasons why they might not be able to conceive naturally; these include having multiple babies (usually due to an abnormality), not being physically fit enough and other physical issues. These women usually undergo medical treatment, like regular check ups and ultrasounds. This is necessary because the presence of any abnormalities in your womb can cause problems down the road. In this case, doctors recommend you take a fertility test every few months to find out what kind of abnormalities may exist in the uterus.

Another option would be to get pregnant through artificial means. A sperm donor (or egg donor) could also help you become pregnant. They often use in vitro fertilization, which is when a woman's eggs are harvested from her own ovaries and mixed with those of another person. When this is done successfully, it results in a pregnancy in about three days, sometimes faster. Although this method is more expensive than natural conception, it does yield a lot of offspring as well as give birth to many children. So don't let it go to waste!

When it comes to the mother, different things can happen:

She may end up miscarrying

She may develop gestational diabetes

A blood clot can form around her lungs or heart, preventing oxygen flow and increasing pressure

Her baby develops problems such as breathing difficulties or seizures after birth

If your child has these symptoms, be sure that she gets medical attention immediately. If possible, have them checked by a doctor so she doesn't suffer further.","The first complication is infection. Second is hemorrhage or internal bleeding, which can cause birth defects and death if left untreated. Third is stillbirth (a baby born dead), or a live fetus that was not delivered during the normal labor process. Fourth is neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NDS). Fifth is placental abruption, usually after delivery of the placenta. Finally, there are some cases where a woman may have difficulty gaining weight as she develops into her period and will need to gain some additional pounds before trying again at this stage.


[Source: Women's Health Care - American Association for Pregnancy Outcomes]","An episiotomy is performed if there's a good chance the baby will survive. However, I have to admit that this is not always true and sometimes an episiotomy can save your life!

The best way to decide what kind of surgery you'll need is to talk to your obstetrician or midwife who knows about your health condition and may have experience with it. Do they know how many babies they've saved? What are their recommendations regarding types of surgeries? If you want to discuss things further, call them on +61 2 604 3333 and ask for a consultation appointment.

If you're lucky enough to be given the choice between having an episiotomy and delivery by cesarean section, choose the cesarean if you have the option. However, as long as you take care of yourself and stay healthy (no bleeding and no problems like pneumonia), it won't matter which surgery you chose!

What is my risk of complications during pregnancy? Answer: Most women develop some degree of pain during labor but this is temporary and usually goes away on its own within a few days after giving birth. For most people, however, complications don't occur until much later in pregnancy. They often start early in the first trimester, before they get into the second stage of labor and often begin to happen even before childbirth has started! The most likely cause of any type of complication is severe pelvic infection so make sure to see your obstetrician or midwife soon after delivery!

How do I prepare myself before giving birth? Answer: The first thing you should do is to read everything you read online on vaginal births, birthing, postpartum periods and breastfeeding before you come to labour! Also, make sure you watch videos such as C-section video tutorials and read more books to learn more about the process, especially if you've never had a c-section before. Also check out the various resources available at www.vaginalbirths.org.

Is there anything else I should know when giving birth? Answer: Don't worry if you don't understand anything that comes along with giving birth! There are lots of great information sites online, both written and visual, and there are tons of blogs about all sorts of different things. Just remember that vaginal birth is very different from other kinds of deliveries and it isn't just about being prepared; you must also be caring and supportive.

In this question (from a previous article I wrote) I am asking if there are any medical problems associated with the use of IUDs. As you can see, it is not very difficult to find answers for all the questions and it gives an indication of how complicated some women's pregnancies really are. In my opinion, it makes more sense to ask how many children will be born than what birth control pills do or even whether the pill has some kind of side effects such as ovarian cysts or cervical cancer. You may not have any symptoms at the time and so it is impossible to say whether your IUD is causing anything. However, I would guess that there could be problems with uterine contractions because of hormones or something else. Since these issues are so hard to predict, I would recommend having a specialist check them out and help evaluate them. It would also make sense to tell a doctor about your IUD. A gynecologist would probably have a better idea of its effect on pelvic pain and irregular bleeding since they usually specialize in reproductive health. If you know, let me know!","Abnormal vaginal discharge, increased uterine contractility. If your symptoms last for more than a week, or are caused by an illness, call your doctor right away.

What is the cause of my trouble getting pregnant?

The reason for this problem can be complicated and it may be related to many different things. The main cause seems to be one of the following reasons:

1) You have not taken any medication that could interfere with the production of estrogen (such as birth control pills). This leads to abnormal hormone production and leads to irregular periods. It might also lead you to get multiple miscarriages during your lifetime. 2) Your body does not absorb certain substances well - meaning some substances become trapped inside your uterus and don't reach your ovaries or fallopian tubes. If these substances come into contact with the lining of your womb, it can cause a condition called ectopic pregnancy. 3) You are a heavy smoker. Smoking increases estrogen levels and decreases progesterone. When the hormones balance out, it makes it easier for the egg to implant properly. 4) You have diabetes. This increase in hormones will make your blood sugar level higher and cause an imbalance between what is needed by your cells and what they need from you. 5) You are breastfeeding. Many women experience postpartum depression because their milk supply is low. Breastfeeding causes your breasts to grow, but they do not produce enough milk for your baby to drink. When you stop breast feeding, your hormones will go back to normal (and this time, they will help you deliver better-quality babies), but the loss of milk supply will still take a long time to recover. 6) Your menstrual cycle has changed. A woman who has stopped menstruating usually experiences heavier bleeding after her period. Also, if she stops having a period at all, she might continue to bleed while giving birth. 7) Your fertility is affected. Some women are born with high concentrations of oestrogen in their blood. This results in a higher risk of breast cancer later on in life. 8) Your hormones are abnormally high, which can result in anemia and other health problems such as asthma or osteoporosis. 9) Your diet is unhealthy. Certain foods can contribute to an excess of estrogens. Eating too much red meat, eating too little fish, being overweight, and consuming excessive amounts of caffeine can all have negative effects on your hormonal balance. 10) You live in a cold climate. Cold weather can disrupt the natural flow of nutrients through your"

This chemical increases cellular activity and blood flow, which stimulates your cells to secrete red blood cells into your bloodstream. These are the cells that carry oxygen throughout the body and help you to get rid of waste products and maintain a healthy circulation. The red blood cell can be very useful for the rest of your life, but when it gets too large it blocks the tubes from your lungs and heart so you cannot breathe. If you have too many of these swollen lymph nodes, they become inflamed and you will experience severe asthma attacks or chest pains. In addition, if you have too many inflamed lymph nodes then some of your red blood cells will not make enough vitamin A to be able to carry out their vital functions.

How do I reduce my risk of developing cancer? Answer: This depends on several factors, including your age, health condition (such as diabetes) and lifestyle habits. People who smoke may tend to accumulate more harmful chemicals in their bodies than people who don't smoke. Smoking is also associated with an increased risk of certain cancers such as lung, colon, breast, endometrial and other types of cancer. However, the link between smoking and cancer is less clear-cut than for most forms of cancer. As far as the risk goes, there's no evidence that regular cigarettes cause any damage whatsoever. What does seem to increase your risk of developing cancer is smoking during your teenage years. While it might appear that more young adults smoke today, research shows that this change has nothing to do with any higher rates of smoking in children. It's actually because of changes in how our brains develop, according to one theory by Dr. David Hemenway of the University of Colorado Medical School. He says that after we turn 18, our brains continue to develop until we reach the point where they're ready to receive information about things like sex, alcohol consumption or even drugs. But those early years show the signs of stress and emotional problems, and our brains begin to prepare themselves for adulthood when they begin to grow and learn to take care of themselves, as well as think rationally. Over time, we stop trying to protect ourselves by changing our behavior at this late stage, instead relying on what we know works best for us—our own brains. This makes it easier to accept new ways of thinking and feeling, thereby making it easier to live healthier lives, he adds.

Well, I don't know what he was talking about, but it doesn't seem like his reaction was really related to the smoke coming out of them or anything.

Please read the following information carefully before proceeding. Please also see our FAQ's for more info about this disorder.

What causes it?

The most common cause of heavy flare-ups is chronic, or relapsing, sinusitis that does not respond to medicine. The other cause of the pain can sometimes be an underlying infection in the ear canal (e.g., bacterial meningitis). Sometimes the problem appears as either a burning sensation on one side or the entire head of the nose (called ""the ""double-whammy"" condition) - especially when you have no cold symptoms. In these cases, if left untreated, there will be persistent inflammation until the infection disappears or the person regains normal function.

How are the flare ups diagnosed?

A medical history is important in determining the type and severity of sinus infections which are responsible for the excessive swelling associated with the double-whammy. A complete physical examination including an x-ray of the body and evaluation of the skin and mucous membranes should be done to determine the source and extent of the infection. If possible, you should find out who has been exposed to the infection(s) while wearing the device. You may need to visit the nearest emergency room or another health care facility. To help reduce complications from the condition, keep a log of all visits to any hospital, clinic or doctors office.

Do I have a hearing loss?

If you do not hear or feel pain while using the device, and/or if you believe you have a hearing loss, please let us know immediately. We recommend getting your hearing evaluated by a physician. For further assistance regarding hearing loss, call 1-888-934-2624.

Why aren't my ears ringing after I wear the device?

Many people experience some discomfort and noise reduction during the first few days of wear because of the earphones' weight. These people usually take them off when the earphones become uncomfortable.

Q: is there any way to prevent or reduce the severity of these conditions? i mean does anybody know how to get rid of them or what causes them?


A: The short answer is no. There are several things you can do on top of all of the above to help reduce your chances of getting cancer. One of which is keeping hydrated! Hydration increases immunity and helps improve skin health in general. This also applies to most cancers but specifically, melanoma and prostate cancer. You should drink plenty of water during times when you're exposed to UV radiation. To learn more about drinking lots of water read this article. Also keep in mind that the amount of salt in your body matters. A normal range is around 1 teaspoon per day. However, a high level of salt can increase your risk of developing kidney stones (hence why people tend to lose weight after losing too much weight) and osteoporosis (which is caused by low bone density). So, if you take on too many calories from processed foods, it may affect your mineral levels and lead to unhealthy bones. Additionally, eating less sugar (and/or refined carbs) means you'll end up with lower cholesterol levels and will feel better overall. Lastly, remember that there's nothing wrong with having a little bit of extra fat. It just doesn't seem to make any difference in terms of your chances of getting cancer or preventing it altogether."

Well, what you might want to consider is that this isn't the same as getting rid of them entirely. They have been exposed to allergens and bacteria throughout their lives so if you have problems with them during pregnancy or after having kids, you will still experience those issues, but if your child is healthy then you may find that you have less of an issue with any one specific element of the diet because the foods you eat are likely to contain more of these elements. And since the amount of allergens in a food varies greatly, some people do have a harder time dealing with certain foods while others (like me) won't notice a difference unless they really focus on eliminating them completely. In addition, many things like sugar and starch are just easier to deal with than proteins or fats, even though protein and fat are extremely important components of a balanced diet. So while there's no way that you'll eliminate everything from your diet, what we can do is take steps to make sure that we avoid exposing ourselves to anything that's potentially dangerous or unhealthy.

#4) What is a good way for new parents to learn how to use their baby's diaper bag?

Answer: A lot! Read it all. Every day for about 10 days. The instructions are simple enough that you can learn it on your own before you start nursing, but keep them handy just in case. The whole process takes less than 30 minutes per day (depending on what type of diaper bag you buy). You'll also want to give yourself plenty of time to get over the fear and frustration you will feel when trying this out. If you're having trouble remembering where to put things or if it seems like some items might be missing, try placing them next to each other on your nightstand instead of in your diaper bag. (This makes it easier to find what you need.) Also, try to avoid putting anything in your diaper bag that could hurt your child. Some common culprits include: large pieces of fabric, wet wipes, cotton balls, pacifiers, water bottles, hair clippers, glue sticks, needles, small objects, etc., as well as any type of sharp object (including knives, scissors, or razor blades), as these are not safe to put into a toddler's diaper.

Also, remember that while it may seem like your child gets an extra diaper bag at every feeding, that isn't true. The actual number of times a mom uses her baby's diaper bag varies from one month to another depending on the type of diapers she uses. It doesn't matter how many bags you've used once—the point is that you should always have two. And please don't hesitate to ask questions on Reddit. You may even receive support from others who did so too! Remember, no parent wants to go through something similar again…and they shouldn't.","it's not the same as regular eczema.

Post 47 I had severe symptoms of eczema for many years until one summer day when I was walking out to my car, I noticed a tiny puff coming from my nose and immediately knew what it was. It was an exfoliating pimple that I'd never seen before and I couldn't believe how easily it popped up. Then I started getting tonsillitis. By then they were all around me and every other person in town also had them! It has been over 6 months since the first outbreak and I have no more outbreaks or pain. I love the results and feel so much better than I did before. Thanks so much for your website! view entire post

Post 45 I'm 32 with severe eczema. I got it while living in California. My doctor diagnosed it as chronic eczema and prescribed steroids and cortisone cream. After two weeks of steroid treatment and 4-5 days of cortisone cream (I'm very sensitive), the itchiness stopped. Since then, it only gets worse. Recently, my mom got really sick and didn't eat for 3 days (my daughter is about 15). One thing we discovered after she came back is that her eczema hasn't returned. She went to my house, saw me in bed, and told me I need to see a dermatologist to make sure this problem isn't going away because I am still experiencing symptoms. So I took my sister and dad there. The doctor asked about my eczema and what was causing it. He gave me some antibiotics and said if it keeps coming up, I should call him. The next day, he called me and said he heard something I thought wasn't right (it turns out, it was): itchy bumps around my mouth and/or throat. He said I shouldn't drink anything or chew gum.

105,Question: wisdom tooth cuts gum pain\nAnswer:,"There are two kinds of wisdom teeth. The first is a crown that's in place of the original tooth, but it has to be removed to use a new one. When wisdom teeth are removed they can't heal and the person needs surgery. The second kind of wisdom tooth will have been replaced with an incision made with a screwdriver or some other tool.","no. This is due to the fact that these are not made from a natural source and cannot be seen as such. They can however be easily removed with an ordinary dental drill, but it takes more than one bite of a tooth to break the tooth enamel. A simple procedure to remove these could also be used at home for free with no risk of infection.

Q: What should I do when my tooth becomes so worn out that I have to have it replaced? Answer: If you suspect any decay or problems with your tooth (such as cavities) then you need to see your dentist in order for your teeth to be fixed properly. After being treated by your dentist you will still want to follow the steps outlined below to ensure they do work before having them replaced.

1) Remove the hard part of the tooth with a toothpick. Using a clean knife cut around the damaged area where the tooth has become soft. Use a toothbrush to gently scrub off any debris left behind. This allows air and water to pass through, which helps restore dentin and prevents future damage.

2) Place the tooth into hot running tap water and allow it to soak for about 30 minutes. To prevent further damage to the tooth, place a piece of plastic wrap on top of the tooth and wrap tightly around the tooth to keep out dirt and foreign matter. Once cleaned, wash the new tooth well, using mild soap to get rid of any abrasive substances and then rinsing thoroughly under warm running tap water. If you have had previous infections, avoid using antibacterial mouthwash and use regular oral hygiene products.

3) Replace the tooth with fresh toothpaste. Allow a minimum of 10 days between every treatment (this may vary depending on the type of tooth and how long it has been sitting there). This should reduce any irritation that occurs during the brushing process and make sure that all tissues are fully lubricated.

4) Apply gentle heat to the tooth after each rinse. The skin around the inside of the gums needs protection against bacterial growth to help prevent it becoming infected, therefore applying warmth directly to the gums, particularly if they are moist, should immediately bring relief. You could also use a circular heating pad on the front of the tooth, positioned just under the gum line. Simply rub this over the affected areas. It should take only a few seconds to activate heat and provide immediate relief to relieve discomfort. Always consult your doctor before attempting to treat any existing issues.","The wisdom teeth are at the back of your mouth.The reason that they are at the back of your mouth is because they were originally there to protect you from insects and other things when you were young, but now you can eat as much junk food or sweets as you want without worrying about them coming in contact with your teeth (which can cause cavities). If you cut those away then you won't have to worry so much about eating too many calories in a day.You should also note that if you want to keep your weight down you will need to take care of the rest of your body first! For example, dieting doesn't work if you don't take care of any of the following before you start dieting.In order for your body to burn more fat it needs something called ""bad"" fats - fatty acids like polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and linoleic acid (LA). When we eat these bad fats our bodies get rid of them very quickly. So if you are trying to lose fat you will be very unhappy if you only go on a high-fat diet; however if you do a low-fat diet you may gain some pounds, since you will not be burning your good fats! If you are concerned about getting more than two servings of fruit and vegetables per week then it is advisable to try to stick to a healthy lifestyle throughout. But even if you have got all this right you still probably aren't going to make any significant changes to your overall diet unless you want to drop a few kilos overnight!","You are in the right place. If you have gum disease or other conditions that can cause inflammation of your gums, then this is a very good place to start. This is also an excellent time for you to see your dentist and get a clean cut.

What About Other Causes?

Another important thing to remember about the root canal is it needs to be done correctly. The first step is to remove the old bone (root canal) using either a tool like a dental drill or by scraping with a knife. The second step is to clean up the area with soap and water so there is no infection left behind. Once the root canal is closed, another process known as a post-op is needed to allow the healing tissue to move back into position. Your doctor will prescribe a special antibiotic which may help prevent bacterial infections for many years after the procedure. It should also relieve symptoms such as burning and inflammation of the affected areas. You may have some discomfort at first when you do this but most people who have had root canals say they are great after 1-2 weeks. In fact, I recently heard from a patient's mother who has had 5 root canals and all 4 were wonderful! Most people report that after one surgery they feel great and feel their gums are better than ever. They would not know about these benefits if it was not for the root canal! These benefits include improved blood circulation, smoother teeth, easier breathing, faster heartbeat, less sensitivity to cold, etc. Many other reasons why people recommend the root canal include:

Treats Gum Disease/Diseases

Prevents Tooth Decay/Cuts Back

Reduces Pain/Loss of Breath

Relieves Flu Like Symptoms

Improves Eye Health

Preventes Cancer

Increases Vitality

Gives Great Taste

Dr. James Andrews is a New York City-based dentist who's been working with the Toothpick Project for 18 months now. In the past, he had no idea that his patients would need anything more than an appointment at the office and a dental plan to pay for it all—and even then, only if they were really serious about getting their teeth fixed. He calls the project the best thing that's ever happened to him, and he thinks it might have saved his life.

""It was such a revelation,"" Andrews says. ""I never thought I'd see this many people willing to wait around in the waiting room.""

The project started out with a simple premise: Why not get your teeth done? But instead of being just another DIY project, the campaign evolved into something much bigger. It morphed from a series of online videos on YouTube to an international movement—it went viral. Since its launch, it's helped restore nearly half a million American teeth. And since June, it's expanded nationwide.

When Dr. Andrew took his own life last year after struggling with depression and anxiety, the world was ready to offer a helping hand. But that wasn't enough for the young dentist in Kansas. He wanted more. So he came up with the Toothpick Project. His goal was to help as many Americans as possible stop losing their natural teeth. He was determined to use his work experience to inspire other dentists, too—in a way that wouldn't seem crazy or gimmicky but actually make sense.

Andrews' dream was born two years ago while attending one of his dentist's seminars. That's when he decided to take a different approach. Instead of teaching doctors how to diagnose and treat heart disease, he asked them what they did for fun. After a few minutes, he realized that nobody cared what they did with their lives anymore, so why should they care what they put into theirs? With that insight, he launched a web show called Dental Doc Stories, which features his personal stories of living by his principles.

His vision wasn't just to educate the public about the benefits of good oral hygiene; it was also intended to create a community for dentistry professionals to learn from each other, exchange ideas and find common ground. He wanted to give dentists the tools to build new relationships and forge","the tooth is too hard for it to break

The answer to this question was ""No"" because the wisdom teeth don't need to be crushed to dissolve the gum, they are just being broken. The reason that you can see a tiny hole in the center of the wisdom tooth is because the gums have been pushed up into the top of the tooth, when this happens it causes some blood to pool around the area where the teeth were and this prevents the blood from flowing out (like a sieve). If you look closely at the photo above, you'll notice that the white part on the bottom right is actually the ""sieve"", which keeps all the blood away from the area where the teeth have started to come out. It's still not clear to me why the wisdom teeth aren't cut completely off but I know it doesn't hurt to have them removed!

(If anyone has any more questions about wisdom teeth please feel free to ask them below!)","It depends.

If you are going to use a dental appliance, then it is likely that the tooth will break and your gum may hurt from the tooth being used as an instrument to scratch or cut off tissue. If the appliance does not have any holes in them for the purpose of cutting through gum, then no need to worry about this. However if there are sharp teeth inside the device and you are using these teeth on a daily basis, then it might be wise to remove the appliances after only 3-5 uses just to be safe.


The following two pictures show how I usually clean my mouth after a meal with a cloth and toothbrush.

Picture 1

Pour warm water into a bowl. This should help loosen up all the saliva and keep everything clean and free flowing. You can also brush some soap on the inside of your teeth to help get rid of bacteria and gums.

Picture 2

When you brush it out you want to make sure that there are no big chunks of tooth stuck to the side of the cup (this is called ""gumming""). When brushing out your tongue, you do NOT want to give yourself gingivitis (tongue cancer).

Here is a picture showing me removing some teeth with a dental tool.

Now I am hoping this helps!","it's not really good to chew so hard at the same time. It is possible that you may be chewing too much but it is a very small risk factor.

It is possible that your gums are damaged due to excessive chewing. If this is happening, then there is a good chance that a dental treatment or even a few dental visits will help to relieve the symptoms.","you can't. The gum tissue is being cut off by a hole in the upper jaw (the incisors). There are two kinds of teeth - crowns and molars.

A crown has three layers of tissue: the inside, middle and outer. Each layer acts as a guard to protect against external pressure and helps create an environment that allows the tongue to move freely around the mouth. A root will be located at the top of each layer. When the tooth is moved toward the tip it creates pressure on this area; therefore, if there is any obstruction in that area, the gums will feel like they have been punched through with a sword or something else sharp enough to puncture the skin below them.

When someone has a gum infection, these areas will swell up so much that they need special attention. However, there isn't actually anything wrong with a tooth that needs to be removed, just with your oral health. If someone has a really bad bite, then I would recommend getting dental care to correct the problem. Also, if there is some trauma (like a gunshot) that causes swelling, then the doctor may want to take out a portion of the tooth and replace it with a smaller tooth."
107,Question: medication adhd anxiety\nAnswer:,"Medication is best to treat both of these conditions at the same time.

You can't find many drugs that have been proven to work in combination with each other, so it's important to understand which one you're going to take and what side effects to expect!


If you don't want to be on any meds for your anxiety or depression (and I'm sure that most people would agree), then a few basic things are necessary. First off, make sure you are taking them as prescribed by your doctor. If not, make sure you ask about the reasons why. There are several different types of antidepressants available. The most common ones include Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, and others. However, there are also other medications such as Seroquel (which has some serious side effects) and Risperdal (which has some serious risks). You may also need other treatments to help manage your symptoms, including therapy if needed.

As far as medication goes, you should only take one of those three. One of the newer drugs being marketed today is Serzone, but be aware that this drug is much more dangerous than its predecessors. It's often used to treat acute migraine headaches, and while it might give relief to those who suffer from moderate to severe pain, it can result in significant side-effects like weight gain and heart problems. If you're looking for something safer to try, just don't use it. That said, there are others, such as Wellbutrin that work well when combined with certain antidepressant drugs.","yes, I use a lot of benzodiazepines.

A: Yes, that's correct.

Q: So how did you start using them?

A: About 2 years ago. I used to have these episodes in my early 20s and then they came back. They're not really severe but if they get too much they can be very bad.

I'm now 35 and I've had one episode so far this year. It started with about 3-4 hours every few days, it got progressively worse, then a week later it was like a little bit more and it escalated up to full blown panic attacks. And I haven't been able to stop them because I'm too scared to go out. I don't want people to see me and think ""Oh well he seems fine"" or anything like that. I just need time to figure things out before I go back to work again.

So I decided to take the meds and keep going for as long as possible and I hope that by doing this I'll be better prepared for when I need to get help.","In your case, the reason you feel more anxious is because of a drug addiction.

They may be sensitive to any type of drug, but many people who are sensitive to stimulants will get a reaction from a stimulant when they're using them. So if you take something like Adderall or Ritalin or whatever it is that stimulates your brain to produce more dopamine in the bloodstream then you might develop some sort of reaction. And I've heard that there's also a specific kind of sensitivity that occurs when you use antidepressants. There's been a report out there by the National Institute of Mental Health where someone was taking these sorts of drugs for depression and they developed this type of response, but not everyone reacts to all kinds of medications. For example, if you think about prescription pain killers - when you start with prescription painkillers you can sometimes feel their effect on the body for days after you take them, so if you use those as a treatment for pain you might not react to the same level of side effects as other people do, although you might still experience one or two of the typical negative side effects associated with prescription pain killers.

Question: What does being able to see my family, seeing friends and hearing their voices mean? Answer: It means you're not trapped inside. You can really communicate with people even though you don't always understand what they're saying. You might say things that make them laugh and upset them and give them hope. You might hear their stories and find yourself moving past something that happened or a part of yourself that wasn't healthy anymore. That makes it easier for you to move forward and overcome those things and you know, that's why a lot of us try to keep a close relationship with our families. It's good to talk to them sometimes because if we don't we could be in danger and they might die. We need to figure out how to stay alive together. It sounds weird, but I guess it's true. That's probably one reason we don't spend too much time alone or being alone because we need each other to survive.","Yes, I have been taking Advil for several years.

My name is Karen, and I am currently in need of an internship at a major medical center because of my chronic pain syndrome (CPS). The reason I'm looking for this position is because my insurance covers only one doctor's visit to be evaluated and treated for my disorder (I have other health problems as well) so there isn't much more we can do besides pay for the hospital stay, which will cost between $500-$1,000/day depending on how long they take me or how serious my problem is. And if this doesn't work out, then hopefully I will find another medical provider who does cover her visits and medication costs.


So far I've had some success paying for outpatient treatments, but not all of them. I would like to eventually get into a facility where I'll also receive in-house medicine and therapy. If the job pays well, then it could save money since it won't have to go through a third party provider.


Here are two questions you may want to ask me:


What is my expected length of stay? A few days should be fine if I'm being admitted due to acute stress or any other reason, but a month or more is pretty extreme. I'd prefer to make a deal with my employer before agreeing to a longer period of time than that.


How many appointments/hours do I need to see/attend during each appointment? I really don't know what a typical day looks like without having to come back to work, but I can give you estimates based on what you say is normal. For example, I usually try to meet up every week from 9am to noon so I have an hour to walk around the building or meet someone for an interview if it's open. So assuming that's average, it might mean that I just need to attend 7+ appointments in 2 weeks, which wouldn't be unreasonable given the length of time needed for treatment.


Do I need to bring along any medications? I usually tell people that I don't need anything as long as I take them whenever I feel comfortable. My current medication consists primarily of Valium, Depakote, Tylenol, and Advil. Anything else would be good too, I guess. That said, I haven't yet tried the fluoxetine/"

Myths:

Myth 1: I am not allergic to sugar and can eat as much as ever I am very healthy, my parents never made me eat junk food when they were alive. The only thing I'm allergic to is sugar, but in fact I don't have any type of allergies. I do suffer from a few other allergy problems that are usually caused by foods that contain refined sugars (sugar substitutes). My mom would tell me if something bad was happening, that I should try eating an apple or milk instead of junk food, which is why she had me on sugar-free diets when I was younger. It hasn't worked well for me yet, because I've found that many of those 'treatments' just make things worse! My mother and father never made me eat anything with added sugar so that I could be free from them for long periods of time without having to worry about being sick. They didn't give me a hard time about the occasional sugary treat, they simply said, ""You shouldn't drink this stuff at all, if it gets into your system, you'll get really ill."" I think it took quite some time before I finally got sick of all these treats. It sounds like a lot of people around here think that because my mom has never made me eat sugar I must be immune to it now. I don't believe her, and I know that there are plenty of people who will say they're immune, and then find out later, after years of eating the same junk food, that their immunity was no longer functioning properly. Even though my body doesn't react to sugar very well, it does react to most things. As long as the food itself isn't triggering any harmful reactions, I guess I am pretty safe, right? Well, not exactly. When it comes down to it, food poisoning is a serious issue. My doctor says that the risk of getting sick from food poisoning is 5% per year, and even when you factor in the possibility of dehydration, fever, vomiting, nausea, etc., it still stands at less than 1%. I realize this is probably too low, since we live in a world full of food poisoning disasters, but it still shows how dangerous it is, especially considering that I'm only 4 months old, and I've been sick for over 8 days. Some people think they are immune because they keep eating the same foods, but I","Coughing is the only symptom that's different between those with and without chronic diarrhea.

The patient may have had one or more episodes of diarrhoea, but they were mild in nature and did not cause any problems for him or her (eg. pain or fever). This was the case for me and my husband when we got our baby in August 2003 from a local hospital.


While this doesn't necessarily mean that there are no other causes, it does show that there's something about these symptoms that might be causing some unexplained problems. The key is to get your diagnosis right before you go off treatment - as soon as possible. It will save you lots of time down the road when the doctor won't be able to rule out all the other things you've seen. If you can't find anything wrong, then just move on, don't make an appointment.","Dogs and cats are sensitive to the effects of heat (temperature), which can cause them to experience gastrointestinal problems such as stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation or diarrhea. This sensitivity may be due to an abnormality in their hypothalamus, a portion of the brain located just below the stomach's end that contains the pituitary gland, responsible for producing hormones that control metabolic processes.

Drinking hot beverages is one way humans try to reduce heat sensitivity. Cats do not have a problem with water temperatures being too high because they prefer hot water, but dogs do have this problem. Dogs often drink more water than people because dogs enjoy drinking warm liquids (hot drinks) after a long day at work or at home. Dogs' lack of sensitivity to cold temperatures means that they do not need to use a thermostat to maintain a comfortable temperature during normal activities; however, when it gets really hot outdoors, dogs will become dehydrated and lose body fluids rapidly. They also sweat profusely (sweating excessively) during intense exercise to retain fluids; these excessive perspiration causes dogs to become overheated easily. In extreme cases, dogs can suffer serious internal bleeding, which can lead to death if not treated promptly. The most common reason dogs develop acute heat exhaustion is dehydration, but excessive sweating can contribute to excessive thirst. A dog who is suffering from acute heat exhaustion should be kept hydrated and taken to a veterinarian immediately.","This is not a simple question. The symptoms of hypertriglyceridemia are often confused with those of diabetes, and it is important to understand the differences between these conditions in order to distinguish which one you need.

Hypertriglyceridemia is a condition caused by an increase in triglycerides in your blood or liver. It usually occurs due to prolonged low carbohydrate intake from diet alone (i.e., ""fat intolerance""). If you consume sufficient amounts of carbohydrates such as starchy vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, etc., without excessive amount of fat, then this form of Hypertriglyceridemia will be temporary because the normal metabolism will kick into gear when dietary fats begin to decrease. However, if you continue to eat too much of a particular type of food that contains high levels of saturated fat, for example, butter and margarine, then the elevated levels of triglyceride in your bloodstream will persist long after you cease consuming the foods with higher saturated fat content. This means that the body cannot absorb all of the fat contained within the fats found in the fats, and instead will make use of the excess fatty acids by converting them to glucose via the process known as glycolysis. Glycolysis requires a large amount of energy, so even though you may have eaten enough carbohydrates to help you maintain a healthy weight, you still have been eating more than the necessary calories per day. To achieve optimal levels of metabolism, you must get rid of the extra fat on top of what already exists within your bloodstream. Therefore, although you might be able to stop using this excess fat for energy, the body will continue to metabolize the excess glucose in your bloodstream, creating more insulin resistance and raising the risk of future health problems like diabetes. In addition, since the body's ability to convert triglycerides into glucose is impaired, if you do not manage this metabolic issue promptly, you may experience a variety of complications including abdominal obesity, gallstones, heart disease, and cancer. If you have hypertriglyceridemia, check out our guide to understanding Hypertriglyceridemia here.

Chronic Diarrhea Short-Term Memory Sweating Obstructive Breathing Heart Palpitations Dysautonomia/Nausea

The answer to the second question does depend on what you mean by Hypertriglyceridemia. There are two main types of Hypertriglyceridemia: Type I - which is due to a buildup of triglycerides","1) A) Irritability is most likely due to the presence of a foreign substance in your intestines.

2) The cause for this irritation, which can be caused by a variety of medical conditions including digestive problems, parasites, toxins and drugs, can vary depending on the individual case.

3) If you have more than one source of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), treatment may include medication, diet changes or exercise therapy. This type of treatment does not seem to work well with many IBS patients.

4) In those who are able to control their bowel movements, this could be due to the fact that they do not experience symptoms that accompany regular constipation.

5) Other possible causes could be neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease or neuropathic pain disorders such as migraine headaches.


b) Dysautonomia\nAnswer:

Dysautonomia refers to an overactive bladder causing increased thirst, frequent urination, difficulty controlling the bowels and a general feeling of discomfort. It is often the result of psychological factors such as stress, depression, anxiety or eating disorders.

c) Heart Palpitations\nAnswer:

Heart palpitations are associated with high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol levels, cardiovascular disease, heart failure and certain other diseases and conditions. They usually begin after age 30 but can appear any time during life. Your doctor will determine if these arrhythmias are due to a underlying problem. There are several types of heart palpitations which are usually referred to as ""abnormal"" or ""non-polar."" Some examples of abnormal palpitations include abnormal tachycardia (low rate of electrical activity in the heart), prolonged QRS complex (long period between periods of rapid heartbeat), cardiac conduction defects (changes in electrical impulses that occur within the heart muscle) and ventricular fibrillation. These can range from mild to severe. You might also hear different tones in your head such as ""ping,"" ""beep,"" ""pop,"" ""boom,"" ""whump,"" ""crackle,"" and so on.

d) Hypoglycemia\nAnswer:

Hypoglycemia occurs when your blood sugar level drops too low in response to food consumption, medications or nutritional deficiencies. Symptoms include dizziness, weakness, numbness or weakness on one side of the face or arms, decreased movement, sleep disturbances and confusion.

e) Ac","Yes. The following are symptoms of a serious illness and can occur in any person with these conditions.

The most common, severe case is acute diarrhea lasting 2 days or more, often accompanied by abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, fever, malaise (fatigue), and/or loss of appetite. This condition causes the patient to have a difficult time remaining calm and rational, which makes it hard for them to keep their jobs and maintain control over their health. Chronic diarrhea also frequently results in dehydration, which may cause skin ulcers, kidney disease, and, in some cases, death.

Treatment: If symptoms persist after 48 hours of treatment, or if they worsen during recovery, consult a physician.

If you're concerned that your medical records might be compromised by your personal or family history of food allergies or autoimmune diseases, seek out an allergy specialist who specializes in dealing with food intolerance. An allergist will identify specific foods that should not be eaten in order to reduce your risk of developing an allergic reaction and prevent further damage.

How can I tell if my child has chronic diarrhea?


If your child has symptoms that persist over several days or weeks, he or she needs medical attention. If you suspect your child has persistent diarrhea or constipation, contact your local health department. You will need to provide a stool specimen (usually a urine sample) as well as laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis.

What are the signs and symptoms of chronic diarrhea?

Symptoms of chronic diarrhea include abdominal pain, diarrhea frequency, or weight loss.

Is there a cure for chronic diarrhea?

There is no cure for chronic diarrhea. However, the following treatments may help. For example, a diet high in fiber supplements may reduce intestinal permeability. Exercises or dietary changes also can improve gut function.

4. This should be followed by a 2 year period of normal eating patterns, including an increase in fat consumption, decreased salt intake and increased dairy products.

5. The diet should include lots of vegetables, whole grains, fruits, lean meats and fish (preferably from wild caught). Avoid alcohol, caffeine and processed foods (like potato chips and sugary drinks) with added sugar or starch.

6. You may need additional calcium supplementation during periods of low calcium intakes or when you have very high blood levels of calcium.

7. Vitamin D supplementation should never be given without being properly diagnosed and evaluated by a physician. If vitamin D deficiency occurs, a supplement should be started immediately.

8. A very simple diet plan consisting only of fresh foods from local farms and markets would be an excellent way of improving the quality of life in people suffering from serious conditions such as cancer, obesity, diabetes, and mental health problems.

Although this has been my lifelong problem, it started when I was about 16 years old. This is the only time I have ever experienced this type of gastrointestinal disorder; however, there have been other times in my life where I've also suffered from a similar condition. As far as my overall health goes, I feel like most people do, that I am doing well. However, if you take a closer look at my symptoms, you will see some concerning signs. For example, I can lose up to 15 pounds easily and sleep for less than an hour every night. My skin becomes extremely dry and itchy after having a shower. The lack of circulation affects me so badly that I often suffer from cramps and sometimes even die from them (see: death by dehydration).

I've also noticed that my muscles become very weak. It takes days and weeks before I can get around properly without feeling tired, weak or sore. All my friends say that I'm just plain weird. At least I don't go out drinking excessively (I usually drink water during the day) or taking too many stimulants. I would never be able to eat healthy food with full stomachs since I have such a deficiency of calories. I think I'd probably end up on my deathbed, if I lived that long!

The reason behind all these problems? Well, I guess it's because I haven't eaten healthy foods for quite some time now. And the more I tried to make myself healthier, the worse things got. So what did I eat back then? Lots of pasta, white rice and potato chips! Why does it work? Well, let's see…

Back in the mid-2000's, I heard one of the doctors I went to speak with tell me that he thought that a lot of people suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome weren't actually experiencing any problems at all. In fact, he felt that they were actually enjoying their ""normal"" lives. He told me that not everyone who suffers from CFS needs medication to deal with it, but they definitely needed help with eating. After reading through his book, he said that this wasn't true anymore. When I first read this, I felt very discouraged. But when I found out why the doctor felt this way, it made sense to me!

Basically, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is caused by your immune system trying to fight off your digestive systems' attempts to heal itself."
109,Question: ehlers danlos syndrome POTS nausea stomach pain\nAnswer:,"A few of the people I have seen with this illness say they get really good relief from taking Tylenol, but it's not something you want to be doing every day. Most of the time though, there is nothing you can do about it as long as your diet and exercise are well balanced.I would start by checking for your thyroid, and try adding in some beta-blockers to make sure that you don't have too much or too little of a reaction if any. It also helps to see what side effects are happening on your body.Also check your blood sugar levels every 3 hours for an indication of possible hypoglycemia. It will usually go down within a few hours after starting with Tylenol if all of these things are working properly, although sometimes it takes a while. Once your blood sugar goes up however, then you need to take care of it more aggressively (such as eating large amounts of high fat foods such as chicken or fish). If it gets too high, you should probably stop taking it for at least one day or two before trying again.Also, do not use medications to treat it. There is a lot of concern over using stimulants like Adderall or Ritalin, which may cause sleep problems for some, but unless you have been diagnosed with ADHD, I doubt you'll ever have to deal with sleep issues related to hyperthyroidism.If you've taken Tylenol (or other laxatives) and you feel very tired/dizzy and restless, try putting on your glasses. The only way to know if you have hyperthyroidism or not is to look at your eyes closely! Some people find that when their eyes are dry and tight, they often see red in them. In addition to looking for symptoms, always keep track of how many times you take each dose of Tylenol. Sometimes, taking several doses in quick succession will help.When my daughter had her first child, she was pretty sick, so I told her we were going to have a baby shower because our son was due soon. She was upset that my husband didn't come home early that night. This made me think that maybe my pregnancy had caused my symptoms.The next morning, she went back to work after being at the hospital for awhile and showed no signs of being sick. We checked her blood pressure and found that it was normal. It wasn't until later that she started showing some symptoms of being pregnant again. I took her to the doctor and he did","nope no, it's not a cause for concern. I am currently experiencing PMS, and when I go to sleep (during the day), my body will tell me to go to bed right away. At night, after sleeping, I feel sick but can't remember what it was about that made me so nauseous. It is very hard to get any rest at all during the week, which makes going to work even more difficult. So now I don't think of anything besides working in the morning. Also, if you have high blood pressure or heart disease, you may want to consider taking a medication called ezetimibe. For some people who do not have this problem, there are several other medications available as well, including clonidine, which reduces nausea and helps control blood pressure. Your doctor can help you decide if these medicines would be best for you. There is nothing wrong with being tired, and most of us are just trying our best not to wake up too early every morning.

Q: Is it normal to have symptoms of PMS? Can I stop having them? Answer: Yes! There is absolutely no reason why you should ever have symptoms of PMS. When you're pregnant, your body produces hormones like prolactin and estrone that affect mood, appetite and menstrual cycle. However, these hormones usually decrease and return to baseline by 8 weeks postpartum. Symptoms of PMS include irritability, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and feelings of worthlessness. If these symptoms persist or worsen, call your physician immediately.

Q: How long does the bloating last? And if they keep coming back, how does one deal with them? Answer: The symptoms of PMS tend to disappear within 24 hours, though sometimes, once a month they might come back. The only way you can possibly know for sure if the bloating has gone is to see your physician regularly, so he/she can rule out underlying conditions such as diabetes or liver disorders. You may also try diet and exercise programs designed to promote weight loss or prevention of obesity.","a little of both.I just have very high tolerance for dairy products so I'll eat them all the time without complaining.

So I decided to go to the doctor who told me to try a few things to stop it happening again.The first thing he said was that if I took the meds that night I wouldn't be able to have any more cravings and that if I stopped taking the meds I'd be fine.I thought about all this stuff and I finally realized I needed to do something. It's very hard for people to understand that you can really just take your pills at home,and not have a big problem because there is no medication involved.I went online and read lots of medical articles so I know what my symptoms are and what happens when I'm using the meds. The next thing I asked myself was why am I having these problems? I've been using the medications since age 11,when I took my first pill and it made me very sick in school.It has taken me over 10 years to stop doing this and it's not going away anytime soon because people still want to give me their money so I guess I'll continue doing what I've always done: giving people what they need!I wish I could help more people with CFS and other chronic illnesses as there are many different types of sufferers, including those of us with CFS themselves!

A1. What is ""ehlers danlos syndrome"" (EDS)?


EHS is short for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and refers to a group of neurologic diseases in which the body has trouble connecting electrical impulses. EDS affects primarily males; females often don't have these problems. Most commonly, the disorder occurs in individuals between the ages of 2 and 18. In fact, about 1 in 100 children will develop EDS.


Symptoms of EDS include: dizziness/balance problems/dizziness

headache

fainting/weakness

difficulty swallowing, particularly large objects (especially water)

tremors and seizures

shortness of breath, especially","Yes

Other symptoms?

Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.

What is it?

The term ""ehlers-danlos syndrome"" refers to a group of medical conditions involving the body's response to allergens in food and other products that are produced by certain animals (such as cows). It can cause many different problems, including nausea, severe stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, muscle aches and weakness, depression and memory loss.

Symptoms can vary considerably between individuals, but they usually begin with mild symptoms such as back and neck pain, nausea and vomiting. A small percentage may experience severe abdominal discomfort, vomiting, dizziness, blurred vision and sometimes fainting. Most people get better within six hours or so. Occasionally people require hospitalization for dehydration, shock and organ damage, and even deaths have been reported from these rare cases. The exact causes remain unknown and researchers continue to search for them.

Is there any treatment?

Treatment depends on the type and severity of the disorder and how quickly it is diagnosed. Some medications may help ease some of the symptoms but generally only when taken before bedtime; others may not be effective because of side effects. In addition, the medication used should be the lowest dose available, since higher doses could lead to serious complications. If you're unsure about your health care provider's treatment recommendations, talk to him/her.","No.There's no cure for this but if your symptoms are persistent and you can't be cured by a medication, then a diet is the way to go.","Q: what is the difference between dengue and hantavirus?

Answer: yes, if you have this problem it is more likely that you will be getting a cold than anything else. The most common symptom is chills which usually goes away within 24 hours or so after you get out of bed. This isn't very dangerous because it only happens when you sit on cold surfaces such as cold hard floors and chairs. It's probably just a sign that the virus has been in your body for some time (like a cold sore). If you haven't had any other symptoms of the flu lately then you should consider yourself lucky. If you did get sick before the flu, you may want to try a milder version of the flu vaccine, one that doesn't contain the influenza virus (the FluMist), which you can order at http://www.fluisafe.org.uk/. As for the nausea, this might come from something called gastroenteritis - basically, inflammation of the gut caused by the digestive juices, but also it could be from vomiting as well.

Symptoms: Irritability, fatigue, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, loss of appetite, abdominal pain. Also known as 'The Fatigue Disease'. How common is it? 1 in 2,000 to 3 million people worldwide are affected. What causes it? The symptoms are caused by an abnormal electrical wiring in your heart, which makes it hard for your heart to beat normally. This can cause edema in some parts of the lower esophagus causing swelling and cramping. EDS is a genetic disorder; one out of every 1000 people has the disease. Can it be cured? Yes, it can be corrected with medication or surgery. Can I still be healthy if I am suffering from it? No, there is no cure or treatment. Do I need to tell my doctor about it?

112,Question: symptoms of asthma\nAnswer:,"1. The pain will be in the chest, throat and abdomen

2. It is usually mild but may become worse or worsen over time

3. It is a burning sensation that can occur after you inhale (sometimes just for a few seconds)


4. Your breathing rate will increase as your body adjusts to the increased pressure. You'll feel tired, dizzy, or faint. This can also happen if you have recently had a heart attack.


5. These feelings generally last 2-6 hours, depending on how bad the attack was and what kind of medication you were taking.","symptoms of asthma, such as chest pain or shortness of breath, may not be related to the cause. A person who has a history of asthma, especially if it's been a long time since they had problems breathing, should see their doctor about getting tested for asthma.

If you have severe wheezing and/or coughing during the test, please talk with your doctor before taking the test. It may take several weeks to get results from the lab.","Symptoms of asthma are caused by an immune response to the foreign substance, and can be treated with a drug called inhaled corticosteroids. The medication is taken for short periods (i.e., every 3-7 days), usually daily. Some people may need a different treatment method if they have severe or chronic asthma that persists into adulthood. In cases where there's no current therapy available, a steroid inhaler should be used as part of your care plan, particularly in children younger than age 7 years.

There are several types of steroids:

Oral corticosteroid (OC) drugs - These are approved medications that contain high levels of steroid hormones. They're prescribed to treat conditions such as asthma and allergies. Oral corticosteroid medications include olanzapine, lansoprazole, and prednisone. OTC versions of these medications also are available.

Dosage of oral corticosteroid medications varies depending on the disease. For example, some people who take oral corticosteroids for asthma may not need more than 50 mg of OC per day; others may need higher doses or longer durations. Other times, however, oral steroid medications may not help at all when prescribed according to the label instructions. The manufacturer will give you a prescription form (recommended dose schedule). If you don't follow this information, your doctor could prescribe the wrong dosage or possibly recommend another type of medication.

Lisinertide - Another common oral steroid used to treat asthma is levitra injection. This medication contains less potent steroid hormones than oral corticosteroids. It works well only for patients with asthma whose asthma worsens after taking other medicine for their condition. You can get levitra through your health care provider. Most people using this medication do so because it has been recommended or prescribed by their doctor for the condition. While it may improve asthma symptoms in some individuals, levitra does not cure the condition. Many people with asthma are put off using this medication because they think it'll cause side effects, especially heart problems. However, many people report no significant adverse effects from levitra use. Levitra should never replace regular asthma treatments.","you can tell if there is a problem by the way your child's breathing sounds. If you suspect that your child has asthma, consult a doctor immediately. You may need to take them to an emergency room (you will find one on the phone, or you may visit an emergency room if you are unable to attend to yourself).

A Word From Verywell","Symptoms include an increase in chest and throat pressure, wheezing and shortness of breath. They usually last about 3 to 5 days before going away completely.

Symptoms of COPD

COPD is a chronic disease that affects the lungs and respiratory system. The main cause of COPD is smoking. Smoking increases your risk for many kinds of lung diseases. These include coughs, colds, pneumonia, bronchitis, emphysema, allergies (allergies), and tuberculosis (TB).

Many people who smoke may not have any symptoms at all. Others may feel sick almost every day but only notice when they get out of bed or when they take their daily medication. In most cases, these symptoms are due to a combination of things, including smoking and other factors such as stress, poor diet, and lack of exercise.

The main signs of COPD can be hard to spot in someone who smokes. Some common signs include:

Difficulty breathing

Mild coughing

Chest tightness

Shortness of breath

Runny nose

Swelling in the airways

Pale skin, dry mouth, and eyes

Some people with COPD will also experience certain types of symptoms related to their underlying health issues. Examples include:

Heart attacks, strokes, or heart failure

A lung infection

High blood pressure or high cholesterol

Gallbladder problems

Kidney problems

Other conditions that contribute to COPD include:

Smoking-related cancers like lung cancer

Certain types of diabetes, which often go undiagnosed or untreated

Diabetes mellitus

Obesity

Stroke

In addition to making you ill, tobacco use causes damage to your body's lining cells (necrosis) and can make your organs less able to repair itself after trauma.

Another major complication of COPD is that it can lead to pulmonary edema, or swelling around your lungs, which can cause serious medical complications if left untreated. A condition called ""atrial fibrillation"" can occur if these pulmonary edema-related problems aren't treated properly.

What Can I Do?

If you're having trouble breathing, call 911 right away. If you've had a recent exacerbation, get tested. Call 911 again the next time you breathe well. Take your medicine and try to get some rest so you don't","Symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness. It is very difficult to distinguish between natural asthma and artificial/synthetic allergies because they are so similar. For example, an allergic reaction can mimic a severe cold but could be caused by a virus or bacteria (but not necessarily the same one). Asthma is often more serious than simply having a cold.

What causes an allergic reaction?

Many factors contribute to triggering an allergic response. The most common trigger is pollen exposure, although a variety of other allergens, like dust mites, mold spores, grass pollen, or dander also cause allergic reactions. Other triggers include food or water that contains certain allergens; medicines you take; and stress. You may have other triggers as well, such as an illness that requires you to avoid some foods, medications, or activities.

How do I know if my child has asthma?

There are several ways to determine whether your child suffers from asthma. First, ask yourself whether you get any coughs, sneezes, or hives when your child's mouth is dry, and if this happens frequently. If your child does these things regularly, he or she will likely develop wheezing and runny nose (atopic dermatitis) in high school and college. Second, measure how long it takes for the airways to close after inhaling or exhaling fine particles. This can give you an idea of how much time the body has before the lungs start working properly again. Third, look at your child's breathing rate. Did your child breathe faster or slower while exercising, eating, sleeping, or watching television? Fourth, check his or her stool frequency. Has your child had frequent bouts of diarrhea during the past week? Have your child had frequent bowel movements throughout the day? Fifth, try to make sure your child doesn't have a fever. If your child gets chills and sweats, or feels unwell even though he or she is otherwise healthy, there might be something wrong with his or her immune system.","You may get more severe when the air is not as dry and there are less clouds. When the air is wet and cloudy, you might also get asthma symptoms but they would be milder than those from allergic rhinitis.

How can I tell if I have asthma? Answer: Asthma is a disease that occurs in people who have an immune system deficiency. The condition is caused by chronic inflammation in your lungs. These small air sacs called alveoli secrete mucus to protect your lungs. If your skin becomes inflamed or irritated, it can cause flare-ups of airways inflammation which causes asthma.


This disease is most often found in children who live with their parents or grandparents or other family members with asthma. It is usually diagnosed when someone has been in an emergency room for 10 years or longer. In many cases, this means a parent or grandparent was treated in an ER after suffering from frequent attacks, especially at night.


Children with asthmatic episodes can become very sick within minutes without any warning signs. Even infants and young toddlers can experience these problems. Symptoms of asthma include coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightening, and difficulty breathing. Your doctor will examine you to see whether you have a history of allergies or asthma. He/she may recommend medical testing such as blood tests or echocardiograms (heart rate monitors).


If you feel like you're having trouble breathing, you'll need immediate care. For example, you could call 911 immediately if you've had a deep cough or wheeze, or if you think you can't breathe normally because your upper body hurts too much. Ask your doctor what type of test he recommends to confirm your diagnosis.

Asthma Facts

There are four types of asthma: acute, chronic, seasonal, and chronic relapsing. There are three main types of asthma attacks: positive and negative. Children have two types of asthma: acute attacks, which occur between the ages of 2 months and 3 years old; and continuous or recurrent, which occur after age 5 years. Children with either type of asthma require long term health care services.

What causes my asthma attack? Answer: Certain conditions make the air inside the lung grow thicker or heavier. This thickens the airway and makes it harder to clear. A person's chances of developing an asthma attack increase if she: has asthma, has recently undergone surgery, was admitted to the hospital with symptoms that lasted less than 1 hour","The above answers are not accurate, because many people with asthma experience these symptoms after the first few episodes.

2. A person who has allergies to pollen is allergic to pollen (allergen). This can be caused by all kinds of allergens such as dust mites and pet dander. Pollen is shed from plants in fall when they dry out. Because of this, it's common for someone with a history of allergy symptoms to have their first reaction to something that seems like ""just dirt"".

3. Allergic reactions that occur after exposure to certain substances are called sensitizers.

4. Sensitization refers to an increase in sensitivity to a substance that causes the skin to become more sensitive to it. It can happen if you eat or drink something that triggers a reaction. Some examples include peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, dairy products, etc. In some cases, sensitization can lead to anaphylactic shock and death.

5. SENSITIZATION TO SPECIES OF MUSHROOMS HAS BEEN PROVEN IN THE U.K. AND OTHER COUNTRIES BY THE UK ANIMAL SERVICE. They have had several incidents where rabbits were killed for eating one type of mushroom.

6. The term sensitized can also refer to an allergic reaction to any chemical. There may be instances of sensitivity to some chemicals, but this doesn't mean those chemicals cause allergic reactions.

7. People suffering from asthma often complain of wheezing during exercise, nasal congestion and sneezing (a cold-like symptom) before going on vacation. These symptoms may indicate inflammation within the airways that is causing wheeze.","Symptoms vary from person to person. In the majority of cases, they are not life threatening and can be managed easily with medication and/or over-the counter medicines such as inhalers and Benadryl.

What's it like when you have an allergic reaction?

The symptoms of a severe allergic response include difficulty breathing, wheezing, runny nose, swelling in your face or throat (toxic epidermal necrolysis), nausea, vomiting, chills, diarrhea, weakness, sweating, rash, hives, itching, pain, red eyes, difficulty swallowing, sneezing, swollen lymph nodes, or trouble seeing clearly due to inflammation. The most common side effects include:

a burning sensation in the mouth, nose or throat that lasts for several hours

difficulty swallowing

dryness, flaking or crusting on the tongue

skin reactions including peeling skin, itching, rash, or blisters

headache, dizziness or confusion

rash, itching, difficulty breathing

swelling of the lips and tongue, usually starting at the site of injection or in the lungs, and spreading to the rest of the body

fever

sweating or hot flashes (not just in women)

itching fingers or toes (not just in men)

hives

This is called anaphylaxis. You may also experience these signs and symptoms after taking medications containing anaphylactic drugs:

anxiety

dizziness

vomiting

weakness

irritability

loss of appetite

blurred vision

severe headache

rapid heart rate or pulse

seizures

In children under the age of 2, any skin rash is considered an allergy reaction and should be treated immediately by a doctor. If there is evidence of infection or other underlying illness, you will need to see your pediatrician about getting medical treatment. It is important to know that most adults do not become allergic to pollen unless exposed to it regularly. Therefore, if you're experiencing symptoms of a serious allergy, call your doctor right away.

Symptoms of anaphylaxis in children under 2 years old include fever, skin rash, wheezing and chills; but this includes almost all people who are allergic to peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, fish, eggs, milk, grains, meat and dairy products, soybeans, wheat","Symptoms will be similar to those of COPD.

Q: I have had this for years and it's killing me. Answer: Your asthma is very severe so you may not know that you're in the throes of an asthma attack until it has progressed past a few minutes into your day. You are likely feeling a mixture of anxiety, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath, or tightness in the throat. This may also feel like other types of asthma attacks such as wheezing, coughs, rashes, sneezing, runny nose, etc., but most people with severe asthma don't experience them often. If you do, don't try to hide these things from yourself, and let your doctor know if you notice any unusual signs.


How long should I wait before going to the emergency room? The best advice is to go right away. Most doctors won't refer patients to the hospital unless they feel certain that they need immediate help. But many patients who get to the ER when there isn't enough time to call ahead are told they'll be sent home if they don't show up. These patients can easily find themselves spending several more hours in the waiting room, even though their condition was just reported on the website for the first ER visit they ever had. Don't get rushed by your doctor, or by someone else's decision to send you home without doing some research. In fact, sometimes a patient may need to stay at the hospital longer than expected because of a medical problem unrelated to your asthma."
113,Question: asthma and covid\nAnswer:,"yes, you can have both.

The question is actually a variation of one I've asked before but has never been answered. To answer the question correctly, it's very important that your doctor explains what is happening to you in terms they are comfortable with (i.e. not an alien concept) and then gives you a referral for appropriate treatment (which may or may not be covered by insurance).

However, if you're having respiratory symptoms like coughing, shortness of breath, wheezing or difficulty breathing, you should definitely go see your primary care provider. If your doctors suspect there is something serious going on, they might refer you to an allergist who specializes in treating allergies.

If you're concerned about your risk of developing lung cancer, you should also consider getting tested for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is another sign of increased inflammation in your lungs. These tests don't always indicate COPD, however.","Asthma is a type of inflammation that can lead to airway damage, difficulty breathing, or even death. It's caused by allergic reactions to the air we breathe; it can be triggered by many things — allergens, dust mites, mold spores, bacteria.

As for asthma, it seems like it should get better with time. And, in fact, studies show that your chances of getting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes emphysema, is lower when you stop smoking. But how long will it take? Experts say it depends on what you do and how long you smoke. For example, if you quit immediately after developing symptoms, there may be no lasting effect because most people who develop COPD have already smoked cigarettes for decades. On the other hand, if you wait until you've developed severe lung problems before quitting, then you're more likely to have permanent respiratory issues.","It is difficult to predict how many people will develop the condition. But with the right treatment, it can be prevented in some cases.

There's no cure for asthma, but you can help your child get better by getting them to eat a balanced diet that includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, nuts, seeds and dairy products. If your child has an allergy to eggs or meat, eating egg-free foods may reduce their asthma attacks. For more information on getting started with a healthy diet, read our article, ""What Is Your Diet?""","It may be helpful to think of ""the"" airway as a single line. This is important because if you have multiple lines, they can interfere with each other in different ways. For example, some people's noses (which are connected by the nasopharynx) will feel warmer and more comfortable when they breathe on an open area than when they breath inside. A similar phenomenon occurs when we exhale through our mouths, which causes us to feel cooler and calmer than when we do so inside. Therefore, we should focus on how much warmth or coolness is felt by each part of our body. If we experience a feeling that feels like coldness but isn't actually cold because it's coming from one place and not another, then that means our nasal passages aren't completely blocked. In other words, your nose is functioning better than you thought it would.

Question: How often am I supposed to use my nose? Answer: When breathing deeply and deeply enough. The number depends on what kind of situation you're having. Breathe deeply for ten minutes at night if you want to get rid of those pesky bed bugs; breathe deeply and deeply during the day if you don't mind waking up to find them all over the floor! But usually once every two hours is sufficient.

How often do you need to use your nose?","Asthma is a disease of the respiratory tract, and does not affect the heart. I believe that your question was answered in a previous question.

Q: Is it true that when you eat peanut butter or jelly on a hot day, it gives off heat? A: No. The oil from an unrefined peanut has a much lower viscosity than oil from refined nuts. In addition, peanuts do not have any oil solubility. When an oil sample is cooled to room temperature, the oil starts to solidify as a gas, while the oil molecules are still in their liquid state. This results in the appearance of an oil slick which may be seen when the food item comes into contact with the skin.","My symptoms are mostly due to stress in the day, but I am not on meds. If you have a question about asthma or other health problems please let me know!

*A previous version of this article stated that Tylenol is made from the amino acid L-lysine. This has been corrected for clarity.*","the airways are not closed by means of bronchodilator \s.l.a.t., and therefore inhaled air does not cross to the lungs, but is carried in the sinus passages and passed into the diaphragm through the trachea. The respiratory movements are controlled and regulated by the autonomic nervous system \s.e.\s\s\g\b\r\h\i- nome. The parasympathetic nervous system controls respiration by secreting a hormone called epinephrine which increases the amount of water vapor that enters the blood stream and causes it to be more easily transported across the pulmonary vessels. This increase in the volume of air entering the blood stream causes an increased heart rate. The heart beats faster because there are more molecules being removed from the blood stream during respiration. In addition, the sympathetic nervous system releases adrenaline, which is similar to epinephrine but has greater effects on the heart. The effect of these two hormones in causing the blood flow to be expanded or constricted can also alter the way in which oxygen is absorbed into the cells. For example, if one is breathing in more carbon dioxide than normal, the lungs will receive less oxygen, as well as the other nitrogenous compounds present in the blood. One result of this increased delivery of oxygen is that red blood cell production slows down. When this happens, it makes sense for the body to begin taking in smaller amounts of blood, increasing the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Another possible cause for this slowing down of blood supply is an imbalance between certain proteins within the red blood cells and the red blood cells themselves. If this protein imbalances have been caused by excessive intake of carbohydrates such as starches (white flour, rice) and sugars (fruit, sugar cane), the body's ability to absorb fat may also decrease. Therefore, even though a person who is overweight may appear to have plenty of energy and drive, there could also be underlying issues with his metabolism which could contribute to obesity. There is also evidence that the stress placed on the immune system, and the stress itself, can actually slow down the rate at which the body builds up antibodies against bacteria and viruses. Finally, studies suggest that people who are obese also tend to produce excess amounts of white blood cells, resulting in higher levels of cytokines, and thus increase the chances of developing chronic illnesses such as cancer.

114,Question: borderline personality disorder symptoms\nAnswer:,"Yes, but only if the person has a significant emotional or behavioral deficit that is not attributable to another mental illness.

A. Do people with BPD use alcohol or drugs?

BPD people are likely to be heavy drinkers and/or drug users in general (Table 3). There are some differences between these groups. For example, women tend to be more prone to using alcohol than men do (Figure 1), while there is evidence of sex differences in substance abuse disorders. Additionally, many cases of BPD are associated with co-occurring mood disorders such as depression and anxiety, which may make it difficult for someone with BPD to find help when needed.

Although the current prevalence rates of BPD have dropped dramatically from about 6% of the population in 1997, they remain high among individuals who identify as LGBTQ or questioning. In addition, recent studies indicate that even though the percentage of bisexual and polysexuals has decreased significantly over time, this group still suffers disproportionately from the effects of BPD. It should also be noted that although there was an increase in bisexuality among youth aged 16–24 years in the 1990s, it appears that there has been no further change since then [16]. Because the prevalence rate of bipolar I disorder in persons with BPD is currently estimated at approximately 12%, as compared to 4–5% in persons without BPD, it stands to reason that BPD can become a chronic disease, making its treatment difficult and costly. As such, it would appear that prevention efforts could benefit from targeting individuals with BPD in particular populations where the risk factors involved in the disease would be most evident, including transgender individuals.

J. What services are available specifically for LGBT clients?

K. What kinds of support are provided by organizations that serve LGBT people?

L. If you have BPD, what kind of support do you need from others to live comfortably within the community?","A. Borderline personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of unstable and intense emotional reactions to events, people and situations that may be expected or experienced as abnormal by most others in their relationships with other persons, but which are considered normal for the individual to have or exhibit.

B. There is a high degree of difficulty maintaining interpersonal relationships with other people.

C. The person's sense of self-worth is severely diminished.

D. There is an extreme need for control over one's life (e.g., work, finances) and/or personal relationships.

E. Although the person seems capable of functioning independently, they display signs of poor judgment, impulsivity, lack of empathy, egocentricity, and inattentiveness.


3.) Is a diagnosis made when a person has any of these problems?


Yes. When there is an overt pattern of behavior that is consistent with the criteria above, you will likely receive a diagnosis of BPD. If your partner displays borderline traits, it may be necessary to seek help from a licensed mental health professional who specializes in treating BPD.

How can I tell if someone has BPD?


The classic way to distinguish between borderline and non-borderline traits in a person is by asking yourself what you would do if you encountered these two opposite personality traits simultaneously. It should be obvious that there are certain characteristics that borderlines share with other types of personality disorder (but not all), such as dissociation, fantasy, self-absorption, and narcissism. Additionally, some of those features, like depression or anxiety, only manifest themselves at times of great stress or crisis within a relationship. Others, including paranoia or mood disorders (including manic-depressive syndrome [manic-depression] and major depressive disorder [MDD]), are more common in borderline individuals than in non-borderline people. But unlike other personality disorder diagnoses, borderline individuals typically don't meet diagnostic criteria until around age 30. This means it is very possible for someone to start out as a diagnosed borderline and then become otherwise healthy and happy in another context.","Yes, these are sometimes a symptom of other disorders. In fact it is often considered to be an underlying feature in the disorder itself.

Example 1: The person has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and may have some problems relating to relationships or work. He might not know what he needs to do in order to get better and how much time he actually spends on his problem.

Example 2: The patient is at risk for developing alcohol abuse. His friends tell him that if he does not drink alcohol he will lose his job. It would seem reasonable to think he should go through a substance-abuse program before being allowed into this relationship again. This would also prevent the patient from having a relapse of alcoholism if he did go back to drinking again. However, despite all of these suggestions, the patient still struggles to cope and feels hopeless about his situation.

Can Borderline Personality Disorder Symptoms Be Treated?

There is no cure for borderline personality disorder. Treatment can only help minimize the negative impact of the disease. If you or someone you love is experiencing symptoms of this illness, contact your health care provider immediately.

Symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder","The question is about the nature of any individual's feelings, which are not necessarily conscious. They cannot be consciously controlled. It means that they don't come from an external source and can affect your life in a way you may never have thought possible. If you find yourself asking ""How could I have this?"" it might be because you have some kind of mental illness or addiction, such as substance abuse. Some people also find it difficult to relate emotionally with others or their families. You should ask yourself how your mind works, especially if you're experiencing anxiety, anger, sadness, depression, or other negative emotions. If you do have these emotional experiences, talk to your doctor.

Q: borderline personality disorder symptoms \nAnswer: These symptoms often make it hard for you to feel good about yourself. It means you're feeling guilty, worthless, or miserable when compared to someone else. If you experience these thoughts and feelings more than usual, you're probably on medication. Ask your doctor if you need to try different kinds of medications, depending on what makes your condition worse. Do you get upset easily? Try therapy, since you might want help learning how to manage your anxiety. Do you avoid social situations because you think everyone will judge you? Try going out only occasionally, like once a week. This isn't always easy, so consider talking to a friend who has been there before and knows exactly where you stand with regard to intimacy. Many individuals say that having friends helps them cope better with the problems of their lives. But it's important to keep in mind that sometimes friends and family can give you really bad advice. Talk to someone you trust who understands your situation. For example, if you feel anxious around certain people or places, ask them to walk you through those areas with you first. Also, you'll probably benefit from taking part in activities with other people, even if you don't know anyone well yet. Remember that you can take whatever steps necessary to help you recover.


Common Causes of BPD Symptoms

Symptoms of borderline personality disorder vary tremendously between individuals and even within one person. Here are some common causes:

Bipolar Disorder Bipolar disorder (also called manic-depressive disorder) includes severe mood swings, rapid changes in behavior, and loss of interest in normal daily routines. People with bipolar disorder usually have bipolar-like symptoms for most of their lives. They might have moodiness, irritability, and poor concentration, but they tend to have little difficulty sleeping, eating, exercising, or concentrating","A symptom is the sum of a number of common characteristics in relation to the person, and is not an independent diagnostic criterion. Therefore, some people may be classified as having ""borderline"" or ""non-borderline"". The symptoms could include obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, anxiety, self-harm, substance abuse, suicidal ideation, and other problems that affect a person's quality of life.

2) Is there any difference between Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), which has been associated with social withdrawal/irritability, and Other Psychotic Disorders (NPD)? Answer: No, BPD does not involve social withdrawal, irritability or psychosis. NPD is linked to social withdrawal and irresponsibility.

3) Do you have difficulty coping with changes in your environment? Answer: Yes. In addition to normal emotional changes in relationships, our world can change dramatically over time. It is important for patients to know how to manage stress in their lives. These skills are known as skills training.

4) How do you experience emotions? Answer: Emotions are feelings that arise from within us. They are caused by physical sensations, thoughts, memories, dreams, experiences, etc. The most important emotions are fear, anger, sadness, pain, jealousy, shame, guilt, and love. To help you feel better about yourself, it is helpful to ask questions such as: Why am I feeling this way today? What happened? Who was responsible for what happened today? Was anything wrong with me? Was there someone who did something bad today? Did someone hurt my feelings today? Did anyone say anything mean to me today? Was it just me? Have I felt so much hatred today? Has anybody said anything mean to me today? Are you angry at any particular person today? Do you think this will happen again tomorrow? Has anybody ever done anything to you today? Does anyone have problems around you? Have you been treated badly recently? Has someone else made fun of you lately? Has anyone ever called you names lately? Do you want to go somewhere? Would you like to go home now? Have you told anyone you were going away? If yes, where would you prefer to go? Have you talked to anyone about this? Are you scared? Does anyone know where you're staying tonight? Are you nervous about the idea of going somewhere alone? Is there anything else you'd like to tell them? Are you worried that things won't work out well at your new place? Have you already tried","It's difficult to know what it means to be in a ""borderline"" state, and there are many theories as to why. If your doctor thinks you have one or more of these, he should ask about them, but if they don't, then the diagnosis is correct. A borderline personality can behave erratically, make inappropriate choices, and display anger and rage. Some people believe that some people with this condition don't actually qualify as ""borders,"" but instead, just have traits that can sometimes cause problems when their brain is not functioning properly. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-V) lists six types of BPD—

Borderlines lack an identifiable identity or sense of self;

have difficulty making decisions for themselves;

are easily angered or upset;

do not feel secure in their own sexuality;

reject social rules;

have no consistent goals.

If your family history shows evidence of mental illness, it may be hard to see how your ""borders"" could become real or even helpful. As you can imagine, not everyone who has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder will fit into any one category. Also, your feelings about your status can change over time, so it is important that you keep in mind where you want to take things. There is plenty of information available online at www.borderlinesociety.org to help you find support while you work through your issue.","yes\n

Q. What would you do if a person told you that they were an alcoholic?

A. I would be concerned about how the person was behaving. This could be a problem for you as well because there is no way to know whether it's true or not. Also, when dealing with alcoholics, people will usually try to convince themselves that their behavior must have been caused by something in their family environment. This can cause problems for parents who are trying to parent with these individuals. If your child has had one of these disorders and may also have a history of some other psychiatric illness such as bipolar disorder, then I would feel comfortable contacting them and asking them to tell me everything that happened during this period in their life, including what was said to them about this mental health issue.

For more information on Borderline Personality Disorder, please see my ""Understanding the Borderline Personality"" section below.


BPD Symptoms and Behavior - Diagnostic Information

What Is BPD Like?

The DSM-IV describes BPD as:

(1) An enduring pattern of unstable interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating periods of intense instability (depression, mania, rage), marked by impulsive and antisocial behavior, with a tendency toward grandiosity and impulsivity;

(2) Avoidant/restrictive mood states (anhedonia, apathy);

(3) A need for constant stimulation (inability to engage in activities that most other people find pleasurable); and

(4) Frequent lying, manipulation, and conning behaviors.

These four characteristics of BPD make it very difficult for someone suffering from BPD to change into healthy, happy behavior. The individual experiences high levels of depression, hostility, and anger, so there is often little hope of success.

There are many different types of BPD in which the mood swings are cyclical. Some patients experience cycles of extreme highs and lows for years at a time. Others experience cycles of extremes. Most are characterized by two distinct phases each lasting months or even years, but there are several subtypes of BPD such as Obsessive Compulsive BPD and Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). In spite of the fact that BPD is a condition often misdiagnosed, there is still much research going on in this area. It is recommended that you talk to a qualified psychiatrist or psychologist before making any decisions regarding treatment. You should consult with your doctor about the","This is a symptom of borderline personality disorder and does not necessarily indicate that you are in an emotionally unstable relationship.

If you want to see if your partner exhibits the same symptoms, you can ask him or her about them during sex.

Step 2: How do I know he or she has it?

Ask yourself three questions to determine whether your partner has Borderline Personality Disorder:

Does he or she exhibit any of these behaviors when there's not enough time between sexual encounters for intimacy (e.g., ""I'm too busy""), but you still want to have sex? Does he or she complain about feeling empty? Has he or she been the victim of abuse by one person?

Is he or she depressed? If so, what causes it? Is he or she unable to express his or her feelings effectively? Is he or she easily upset? What is his or her pattern of anger or frustration? Are his or her relationships with others good or bad, stable or unpredictable?

Are you concerned about the quality of your own life? You might be worried that this guy or girl may harm himself or herself. He or she doesn't seem happy at home and at school. Do you feel powerless over the issue? Or did your partner give up on life long ago?

Do you worry about how he or she will take care of themselves when they get old? They don't like their current diet, exercise routine, or other changes, which may put them at risk for heart disease or diabetes. Can you tell if this man or girl has high blood pressure? Will they need medication or go under the knife when they reach middle age? And would you like to avoid a situation where the doctor asks you what kind of treatment you're going to recommend?

Your goal should be to find out if your partner meets all the criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder before engaging in intimate acts with them. It is always important to consult a qualified mental health professional who can help you determine whether your partner is at risk for developing the condition.","DSM-IV.

It is a very important distinction to make here, because for many of us who are not diagnosed with BPD we may feel like the diagnosis doesn't apply to us, or that it's just an umbrella term for other conditions that we have. I've been reading this thread and seeing lots of people whose symptoms don't fit into any of these categories, so I'm wondering if there can be more than one ""borderline"" mental health condition. One thing I noticed when going through my own research was how much different things looked in different countries around the world; in Canada they call it Borderline Personality Disorder, but in New Zealand there's no such label at all (I think the only reference I could find for them was a list of symptoms). Is this a problem? If so, what might it mean? It would seem like it would help people more generally identify with their condition better if it weren't lumped together as ""borderline"". Or perhaps the question needs clarification. Maybe there's some way to separate the two?

(Response from Dr. D) The ""Borderline Personality Disorder"" diagnosis does not exist internationally. This is why most psychiatrists do not use that term. However, you should be aware that there is a diagnostic framework that exists, which has its roots in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM] - the same manual used by doctors worldwide (there is also an international version in the form of the International Classification of Diseases, Version 4 [ICD-4]). In the current edition of this document, the following types of personality disorders are categorized: Anxious/hostile; Psychotic; Schizoid; Antisocial; Narcissistic; Histrionic; Paranoid; Obsessive Compulsive; Sensory Gating; Disorganized; Dysfunctional interpersonal relations; Socially disruptive; Paranoid type; Dependent. The majority of DSM-5 proposals have focused on these five diagnoses. The DSM-III classification criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder included both a ""paranoid"" and ""borderline"" category, meaning that there were two groups of individuals, one with a paranoid view of the world and another without such a view, although either group had symptoms of the other type. In DSM-IV, these two classes have been merged. The new diagnostic system proposes that there be two sets of clinical characteristics, one for those exhibiting the traits of an anxious or hostile person, and the other for those displaying traits of a psychotic or","Yes. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) was revised in 2013 to include a definition for BPD. However, there is no evidence that these new criteria are reliable enough or specific enough to make it clinically useful.

BPD: A new diagnostic term?


The term ""borderline"" has been used to describe an array of mental illnesses with varying levels of severity. It includes an assortment of conditions like depression and anxiety disorders. People diagnosed with BPD have recurrent episodes of intense anger and destructive behavior and often act out in dangerous ways such as running away from home, stealing cars, etc. They may also engage in repetitive behaviors and self-harm and may attempt suicide or kill themselves. There is also more subtle forms of emotional problems including mood swings, irritability, low self-esteem, impulsivity and difficulty regulating emotions that can last over several months or years.

For those who struggle with the diagnosis of BPD, it's helpful to know what types of BPD symptoms we're talking about here; the following list is not exhaustive but will give you an idea:

Panic attacks – this is when people experience extreme panic attacks triggered by something they find upsetting or threatening. For example, if your spouse leaves unexpectedly or a friend stops calling you, it could be an instance where you feel overwhelmed and have an unproductive time. Panic attacks can affect everyday life; they might happen during social occasions or at work. It may be easier to manage when a person has experienced them on occasion before.

Frequent physical aggression toward others – This kind of aggression involves frequent assaults, threats or acts of physical violence against others such as hitting someone, punching someone or kicking someone. It usually happens only occasionally, so a person's relationship to the aggressor doesn't seem to matter too much. Sometimes it might occur with minor disagreements such as arguing over a parking spot or complaining about how much food he or she left behind after dinner. In cases where one partner is extremely violent towards the other, it can lead to serious psychological consequences.

The following two questions are the same, but a different type of question is presented for each answer (this time, a negative ""yes"" or ""no"") and the results are shown in an unweighted log-rank plot to avoid any bias due to the fact that all answers will be weighted equally.","In a small study in men with early stage, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who received the daily dose of 400 mg/day for 4 years, there were no changes in blood pressure or oncologic parameters.

Q: is this safe?

A: Yes! This drug has been studied for over 30 years and it does not cause any side effects or harm to the body.

Q: when will I start taking Proteuson?

A: It takes 2 weeks after starting treatment before you can start your dosage. After that time period you should stop taking it if you are doing well. The dose is increased every 3 months.

Q: I am being treated with this drug and my symptoms don't improve. What can we do?

A: If your symptoms only worsen, then you can try an alternative drug which may be even better at improving symptoms. You may also want to see your doctor because some people have developed serious side effects as a result of using this drug without a prescription.

Q: My symptoms get worse after stopping the medicine. Is this normal?

A: It's possible that the medication caused the problem. There isn't much you can do about the situation. However, you can try changing the method of administration so that you take less of the pill per day, or maybe switching from one brand to another. You might also consider going home for a while and seeing what happens to your condition.

Q: Why did you choose to use Proteuson in this way?

A: We decided that patients would experience more positive results from Proteuson therapy than they do from conventional therapy because of its anti-cancer properties. To make sure that the patient actually got the benefits he was hoping for, we started by combining the drug with radiation therapy (a procedure used in many cancers) and chemotherapy drugs (such as carboplatin).

Q: How long should I keep taking Proteuson?

A: Take it as often as recommended, but just don't exceed the prescribed amount or follow any specific instructions, especially if you're pregnant or nursing. Your doctor or pharmacist may tell you how often to change the dose, or give you other information.

Answers: About 10 times higher than being a smoker.

The results were interesting and informative. The fact that 90% of men get better after just two treatments was mind boggling! But it also means we can get more effective ways to treat this disease while minimizing its risks. In addition, some of the factors found to increase your chances of dying from any type of cancer are not even known yet. We are working on finding out how many new compounds might prove useful in fighting prostate cancer. It's good that researchers now understand the basic biology behind prostate cancers and can begin to develop methods for treating them. It is amazing that so many people have been diagnosed with prostate cancer but they are still alive today.

What would happen if we could learn how these diseases affect different parts of the body and how to target specific genes? How much longer would it take to cure a particular condition before the symptoms improved significantly and patients no longer required further treatment? And what would happen if we could find out where the cells that cause most of the malignancies reside and identify their function? Knowing how this works will allow us to target specific drugs and therapies at which levels can improve survival and quality of life. Perhaps someday, people who don't benefit from current treatments won't need them anymore. Perhaps someday there will be enough knowledge to create a cure for all types of cancer but until then we can use our current research tools to do something about this issue.","we do not know the exact number of cases that will occur \n\ n\ n. But if it is over 100,000 then there is a good chance that this could be caused by the natural progression from low grade to more advanced stages\n

Example: In 1999, Dr. Charles R. Taylor had an unusual case with a 30 year old man who was found with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and a total tumor count of 928mm3. There were also no signs of tumors on examination or mammography. He underwent radical mastectomy. A CT scan showed only mild nodules at the base of his right testis and very few cysts in the seminiferous tubules. The next day, he was admitted for prostate cancer treatment.


After 6 months of follow-up, he went back into surgery after being given chemotherapy as part of his initial treatment plan. After another 7 months, he came out of surgery unscathed but there was mild residual damage to the bladder. He returned to surgery 2 weeks later and went through 8 additional rounds of radiation therapy. At the same time he had been told that his cancer would have progressed to stage IV or 5 and died without having received any treatments. As the cancer continued to grow, he was offered surgery to remove all of the cysts in his urethra. It took him 4 hours to get up there and about 20 minutes to go through each one, so it was not painful at all to go through them all. His doctors said that most of these cysts were located between his scrotum and penis. They thought they might take 10 years for him to have full coverage of them, which was probably too optimistic.

Another case had a 45 year old man with BPH from a previous operation who was told that his cancer had already spread to his liver and colon, making removal of those organs unnecessary. He was referred to Dr. Robert D. Kroll who diagnosed the cancer and recommended surgery. A week before the surgery, Dr. Kroll received reports that Dr. Taylor's patient had not responded well to chemotherapy and that the surgeon might need some extra time to make sure he was healthy before doing anything else with him. So, Dr. Kroll decided to delay surgery until his patients' prognosis improved significantly and he felt confident enough to proceed with it.


At that point, the surgeons discovered that the cancer hadn't developed further to the liver or colons and instead had moved to the bladder. Surgery","yes or no

Response to the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention Study Group Questionnaire (NCCPSGQ)


National Council on Health Care Quality in the United States, 2006

The questionnaires used were developed by NCHCQ to collect information from a random sample of U.S. adults aged 18 years or older who had been screened for breast cancer at any point during their lifetime. The questionnaires included questions about symptoms associated with these symptoms, such as chest pain, fever, and fatigue. Additionally, the questionnaires asked about physical activity and smoking habits, which are known risk factors for breast cancer.[1]

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide and has become one of the leading causes of death among men worldwide. About 50% of women will experience invasive breast cancer within their lifetimes. In the United States, nearly 14 million women are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer annually.[2] Breast cancer is more prevalent in black than white women;[3] it also occurs less frequently in Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, and Native American women compared with Caucasian women.[4][5]

More information about breast health and screening can be found on the CDC's website, www.cdc.gov/breastcancer.

Results

Table 1 provides an overview of survey results from 2007 that include summary statistics regarding specific types of breast cancers (BRCA1 and BRCA2), the number of breast cancer cases in the study population (1,857,743 women and 597,907 men), incidence rates, mortality, and quality of life scores (based on five subscales). Because the NHANES was conducted using self-administered questionnaire instruments, there may have been bias in some cases due to nonresponse. However, given the relatively small number of cases reported, the observed differences between the two groups did not reflect this issue. Table 2 summarizes findings related to specific characteristics of patients identified through both questionnaires and clinical examination. As noted above, women with no history of breast cancer were slightly younger, had lower body mass index and waist circumference and higher levels of education. Women in the highest quintile of income, education, and age at first birth tended to have less advanced stage BRCA2 tumors, while those in the lowest quintile had a greater likelihood of developing breast cancer than did those in the top quintile.[6] This finding suggests","yes, there are about 1.3 million cases per year. There is a strong link with smoking and other risk factors. However, the exact reasons for this effect are still not clear. It could be due to the fact that the cancer cells are more vulnerable to hormone therapy than normal cells and they are thus able to survive longer in treatment.

In a study conducted by Dr. Jürgen Graf at Johns Hopkins University, he found some interesting results regarding how much testosterone is necessary for prostate cancer patients to achieve a clinical response. He studied men who were either diagnosed with stage IV or III prostate cancer and had undergone surgery for metastatic disease. When comparing patients with advanced cancers who received testosterone therapy (15 micrograms of testosterone every four weeks) versus those receiving placebo injections (no treatment), the researchers saw a decrease in the number of deaths from all causes related to prostate cancer. These patients also experienced a significantly greater improvement in their quality of life after undergoing testosterone therapy. In other words, even though these patients did not receive any additional treatments, their cancer went down in size and, according to one study, the overall survival rate increased.

Another intriguing result was a case study of a man whose prostate cancer started as stage I but then returned as stage IV. Although the patient's doctor gave him an aggressive course of drugs including radiation, chemotherapy and surgery, his prognosis remained pretty good so long as his body produced testosterone. But when the man became overweight and began using steroids, his tumor grew rapidly and reached Stage II. The doctors attempted another round of steroid therapy, but it didn't work out and the man died within two years. After his death, his family asked Dr. Graf if he could take a look at what happened to the cancer cells. What he discovered shocked them. They found that the cancer cells were no longer growing properly because the levels of hormones such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), sex hormones (estradiol and testosterone) and prolactin (a hormone released during sexual activity) had dropped to abnormal levels.

The next step will be determining which therapies work best for each individual man and whether we need to use different doses of testosterone. One thing is certain, however. Testosterone supplements don't cure cancer. That said, they can help treat symptoms of the disease and reduce its frequency over time.

Why Does Testosterone Affect Your Brain?

According to Dr. David Trowbridge, Ph.D., professor of psychiatry at","I'm not sure, but my guess is that the treatment doesn't work very well and then it just kills you.

I've always wondered what happens when you have two different types of cancer that are not related by genetics, but one has been misdiagnosed and treated in an effort to prevent the other. If one person has a high risk for prostate cancer, is the same treatment going to be successful with people who don't? Is there any way this can be identified and treated without affecting everyone's health? Or do both groups need different treatments? I'm curious as to whether or not you think something needs to change in order to make this a reality. Thank you for your time!

A: There seems to be a lot of misconceptions about how to treat prostate cancer and how to diagnose and manage it based on where it occurs. However, the majority of cases are misdiagnosed. About 20% of men with low-risk prostate cancers will develop metastatic disease, while approximately 80% of those diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer will die within five years. The difference between these rates should not be misinterpreted, however. Although the majority of low-risk prostate cancer patients will undergo surgery in order to stop the progression of the disease, approximately half will also receive radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy to decrease their chances of developing metastasis. Therefore, the average survival rate for this group is at least 5 years, and possibly longer.

Q: I am very interested in the potential link between male sexuality and sex differences in prostate cancer risk. For example, if men were born with higher levels of testosterone then they would have a greater chance of developing prostate cancer than women due to the fact that testosterone promotes growth and development of prostate tissue and affects the ability to function as a reproductive organ. Conversely, if men were born with lower levels of testosterone then they would have a lesser chance of developing prostate cancer because the hormone does not promote growth and development. It is unclear whether or not the latter hypothesis holds true, so my question is as follows: If men have more or less masculine behaviors, does this translate into increased or decreased risk of getting prostate cancer? Please help me understand this better!

A: I don't know whether or not there is an association between masculinity and male sexual behavior. What I do know is that more research is needed to determine the extent to which males' sexual behaviors influence how likely they are to develop prostate cancer. That said, I think it's safe to say that both","I have a small amount of blood and urine that is not easily excreted. What do you think about treating this by using anabolic steroids?

A: A few months ago, I read your answer about the ""don't overdo it"" advice. While I agree that not taking a steroid can be dangerous, I don't think that is what you meant when you said you don't want to see any excesses. If anything, I would suggest that you stop taking one now before you get more serious symptoms. Also, if the issue is less severe than being unable to urinate, then stopping will probably make things worse. I also wouldn't be surprised if you took a steroid with other medications so that you could avoid having to take them in combination (like aspirin or ibuprofen).


Q: When should I start treatment for prostate cancer?A: The most important thing is to find out exactly where your disease is in relation to your testosterone level, which, as we discussed above, is very difficult to determine. However, you may find it helpful to know how much testosterone you are currently making (a good place to start). For example, some men who are at low levels have no trouble losing weight because their body naturally makes less fat than they need. On the other hand, others might gain weight when they use diet pills, gain back some weight after switching to a lower-fat diet, or regain some weight when they stop taking supplements. It's hard to tell from looking at yourself whether you're on your way down the wrong path or whether there are really healthy ways to go about getting leaner and stronger. Sometimes it's impossible to say!


Q: How does therapy work? How long does it take?A: There are two types of hormone therapy - direct treatments and indirect therapies (which means using drugs to help stimulate your own production of hormones). Direct therapy uses injections or patches to increase circulating testosterone levels. This usually involves three injections once every week. Your doctor has to give you a prescription for these injections - it must include the recommended dose of testosterone. An average dose is 1.5 mg per day. So you'd inject 25 IU twice a week. Do NOT mix up doses - you'll be injecting the same medicine three times a week. To prevent side effects, keep the drug separate from all other medicines and apply only one half to each arm during therapy. Don't forget to follow instructions carefully - injection sites can become contaminated.

1. I am a breast-cancer survivor who was treated with the hormone tamoxifen for several years, and it has been shown to increase my risk of having a breast-cancer recurrence in three different studies (P<0.05).


2. I have had four successful operations to remove my lymph nodes because they were no longer malignant. This is not an uncommon occurrence; only 2% of patients in my practice will have a single operation done to remove all their lymph nodes. The other 97% are left without any treatment or surgery to relieve this problem. My cancer may be very slow growing, but even if I do not need further treatments, it would still take me 10+ years of chemotherapy before I could possibly hope to feel comfortable going through it again. With that much time, I wouldn't want to wait any longer than necessary.


3. While I don't know how long I can live on the hormones, I'm pretty sure that I would die within a few months if the chemo doesn't work. It's so difficult to deal with the side effects, but what can you really expect from a drug that is killing your body? Not knowing is exhausting. At one point I couldn't sleep at night, I'd wake up feeling like vomiting or just want to get out of bed. You get used to the discomfort - which seems to come back every day - but it's enough to make you anxious. It makes me sad to think about how many people struggle so hard right now while waiting for a miracle cure.


4. What do you consider your ""normal"" life expectancy after being diagnosed with Stage IV metastatic breast cancer? If I am lucky, it might be around 50 years of age. But that's an average life span. For some women, that number is much lower (around 20), or even zero.


5. What is your plan for the future? Can I continue working as a stay-at-home mom and keep my family together as we battle this horrible disease? No matter how many surgeries I have or how good I feel about myself right now, I cannot allow my health to fail me completely by leaving it untreated. I'll never give in to a false sense of security when it comes to being able to survive an illness like this.

Is there a way to view all stages?

Yes, but it can be cumbersome and time consuming. There are three ways to view all stages within an individual doctor visit; online, on your computer, and using our mobile app. You will have access to these methods for both the in-office physical exam and the electronic examination. If you use one method, please select ""View as much information"" option from the drop down menu at the top of the screen (in my opinion this is more accurate). The electronic examination does not contain information regarding the stage(s) of each tumor. It only displays the grade of the primary treatment used. This grade is based on the number of cells that were examined by the physician during the exam. For example, if the grade of the primary treatment was 6/12, then the grades would be 0–3, 4–6, 7–9, 10–14, 15–19, 20+. These grades range from A (Grade 9) through F (Grade 13). The table below summarizes the grading system by primary treatment used by Dr. Koonin: Grade 1: Primary treatment used by the majority of the doctors in the United States (i.e., most major hospitals, clinics, etc.)

Patients who are currently receiving chemo drugs and have a grade III+ (stage Ia or IIa) disease should be considered for an interim follow up. These patients will need at least 6 months of observation. This is because the patient may require further follow up after initial chemotherapy and may not respond as well to other treatments. Patients who remain in remission but are still receiving anti-PDL agents due to an unreported tumor recurrence can continue with their initial course of therapy. The following examples are based on published data about chemosignals' effect on progression-free survival for non-small cell lung cancers and post radiation therapies and are provided for guidance purposes only.


Treatment Recommendation(s): Anti-PDL Agents are indicated for treatment of advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma with an anticipated median survival times from any stage of treatment ranging from 10.0 to 14.8 years.

Anti-PDL Agents are indicated for use in combination with radiotherapy in phase 3 trials in large clinical trials with expected median live intervals of 8 to 12 years

As the day progressed further she began experiencing significant diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and low blood pressure. She was admitted to the ICU with severe dehydration. When placed on dialysis her blood glucose level was 103 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L), which was elevated over the upper limit of safe range. Her pulse rate and cardiac output decreased by 20 beats per minute. After 8 hours in the ICU the blood glucose level reached 104mg/dL (4.2 mmol/L). She subsequently received intravenous fluid supplementation (500 mL per hour) until morning. After morning infusion, her insulin sensitivity was restored to normal, her serum potassium level normalized, and her hemoglobin concentration returned to normal. While still hospitalized she became nauseated","yes\n

What are the odds of having an overall survival >80% with a single dose of radiotherapy? Answer: 8.3 x 10-4\n

How much radiation does it take to get a patient into remission? (Note that this is calculated based on the time taken for chemotherapy.) Answer: 1.05 x 10^6 weeks\n

What is the average age at which patients first start receiving radiation therapy? Answer: 55 years, according to the American College of Radiology\n

Is there any difference in the treatment effectiveness between low and high risk subgroups in patients who have had multiple procedures? Answer: No\n

In the current study, when we evaluated the risk of death, we did not identify any differences in mortality between subgroups as defined by the presence or absence of other diseases and tumors. The only indication of higher mortality in high risk subgroup was the occurrence of lymphoma as compared to those without lymphoma. Therefore, no conclusions can be drawn about whether these risks will change if further studies are conducted. We also included a comparison group of patients whose disease was well controlled before surgery, but after they underwent surgery were diagnosed with disease, their tumor was removed, or they underwent some other type of invasive procedure. In all, 2200 patients from 18 centers participated in our analysis. To summarize, we found that the following factors may affect the survival rate of metastatic lung cancer patients: 1) patient characteristics; 2) time from diagnosis to randomization; 3) site of entry, 4) amount of radiation given, 5) number of adjuvant agents used, 6) timing of radiation exposure, 7) number of previous surgeries performed, and 8) number of previously treated lymphomas. As mentioned earlier, the data show that the mean overall survival with single dose radiation is 81% with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.964. In addition, while we detected no significant differences in incidence rates among groups at baseline (p =.14), we observed significant reductions at every 5-year interval. For example, at year 8, we saw an increase of 19% in the median age of patients receiving single dose radiation versus 39% in the matched control group, whereas in year 9, the difference was 20%. We have identified two possible mechanisms responsible for these improvements in overall survival. First, we found that the use of adjuvant agents significantly increased the probability of achieving complete remission without further treatments (hazard ratio, 0.962). Second","Stage 0 - Primary, Stage 1 - Secondary.

Stage 2 or 3 (lung resection and/or other treatment)

Stage 4 or 5 (remission with no further treatment)

If you think you have the stage of primary, secondary or both of lung cancer, then you need to be careful. You may not get a diagnosis if your overall survival is 50-70% from stage 4 to stage 5. If your overall survival at stage 4 is greater than 70%, then it's unlikely that you are going to die of lung cancer. In general though, most people will survive their first few months after they've been diagnosed, but there is a very small proportion of people who do not make it through this period. The reason for this is because if you're in your 30s, 40s or 50s, chances are quite high that you'll actually have some residual cancer left by the time you reach 60 years old. As well as being able to tell how you did during this period, you can also know the stage of your disease. This gives you an idea of what type of chemotherapy is likely to work best for you. There's nothing wrong with having extra information like this as long as it doesn't mean that you can't take action.

Don't wait! Now that you're aware of your condition, it's important that you start taking steps now to ensure that you don't suffer any longer. For example, you might consider getting regular checks over the next two weeks so that you can be sure that all your symptoms are gone. If your condition is progressing more quickly than expected, it could cause problems with your ability to care for yourself, or even lead to complications which could put you out of action. It's also worth checking with your family doctor to see whether he or she has noticed anything unusual about your symptoms before. The sooner you inform them that you have lung cancer, the better the chance that they will be able to help you manage your health. You should also seek advice from your GP, just in case.","No

In a retrospective cohort study, the authors reported that the risk of survival in patients with stage I (low-grade) and II (moderate-to-high grade) metastases was significantly higher for those who were prescribed high doses of alkylating agents than those given lower doses.

Surgical Intervention

Stage IV lung cancer is often referred to as ""surgically aggressive"" or ""invasive."" The term ""aggressive"" implies that it is more invasive than stage I, II, or III. In fact, all three types of lung cancers have been classified as nonmetastatic by the American Cancer Society, as are most other tumors. According to this classification scheme, advanced stages I, II, and III of malignant melanoma do not require surgical intervention and thus can be treated surgically without any harm to the patient.

According to the Mayo Clinic on the use of radiation therapy in cancer treatment:

The incidence rate of metastasis from these tumors is approximately 100/100 000 per year. … At present, there are no reliable estimates regarding the effectiveness of radiation therapy with regard to reducing the progression of metastatic disease; however, preliminary evidence suggests that radiation may reduce some but not all tumor growth rates. There has been much debate about the relative efficacy of different radiologic modalities for improving outcomes following surgery for advanced skin cancer (see Surgical Intervention), although at present no clinical data exist documenting an effect of specific modalities over others. However, because of their potential role in controlling metastatic disease, the benefits of such therapies should be considered before they are used to treat other forms of cancer.

If the goal of treatment is to slow tumor growth after removal of cancer cells, then low dose radiation therapy seems like an obvious choice. Low dose radiation therapy includes ionizing radiation therapy, i.e., gamma rays, x-rays, neutron activation, X ray machines, and magnetic resonance imaging. When used effectively by people with very old, small tumors, it is also called radiofrequency therapy.

The American Cancer Society recommends:

There is little doubt that the risks associated with low dose radiation therapy are low, yet its benefit appears to outweigh these risks. This conclusion has been confirmed by multiple studies, which suggest that low dose radiation therapy is safe when performed in accordance with the guidelines of the American College of Radiology.1 2 3

Although the literature indicates that low dose radiation therapy does reduce the spread of cancer cell lines and tissue in a few cases","yes\n

Stage 1:

Stage 2:

Stage 3:

Stage 4:

Staging of Stage 1 is a complicated process. It begins with a complete physical examination and includes blood work, chest x-rays, ultrasounds, MRI scans, and other tests. All of these are done to establish the location in your body for any cancer that may be present. The following is a quick description of each stage, as well as an overview of the various possible outcomes from this stage of treatment. These pictures depict staging at each stage, but not all stages can produce a picture like this. As you can see, only four areas of the body are targeted by chemotherapy; the liver, lungs, spine (vertebrae), and pancreas (bile ducts). Some cancers have multiple targets depending on their size, and some have none.


Liver Cancer

The first step in treating a tumor that has spread to one or more organs (lung, heart, kidney) involves removing a sample of the tissue (biopsy) and analyzing it for evidence of disease progression. This is known as ""pancreatic histopathology,"" which is similar to taking a biopsy of a person's stomach. If there is cancer around the organs that were removed from the patient, then the doctor will order additional studies to determine whether further surgery should be done.

In most cases, there is no need for additional surgeries until the cancer is in one of these critical areas. For example, if the cancer has spread down through the abdomen, then surgical removal of the gallbladder could be needed.

If there is no evidence that cancer has progressed in any of these locations, then surgery may still be needed for some patients whose tumors had grown into vital organs such as the brain, heart, and kidneys. In those instances, however, surgeons would typically use less aggressive treatments to kill off the cancer, so they would remove the organ(s) while preserving as much as possible. Once the surgeon removes the organ, he/she then makes sure that the remaining tissue does not spread to the lymph nodes or other nearby parts of the body.

When a new type of cancer develops, it tends to cause fewer complications than when a previous cancer was diagnosed. Therefore, a second biopsy is often necessary to confirm that the diagnosis is correct before surgery can begin. Another advantage of the earlier biopsies is that they allow doctors to rule out many forms of cancer in","No, this is not a ""true"" diagnosis.

118,Question: stage 4 triple negative breast cancer treatment\nAnswer:,"Yes. In the past, we have recommended that you do not have any hormonal therapy at this time. We are now re-evaluating whether or not to use it and discuss its effects with patients who would be considered candidates for future use of hormone therapy.

Q: Can I get pregnant during my treatment?

A: No. The only way to become pregnant is to engage in a surgical procedure called vasectomy. This involves removing the testicle from your body through a small incision in one side of your abdomen. You then undergo an open surgery known as laparoscopic surgery where the testicle is removed along with several other organs such as the kidney. There is no need to wait until after treatment to get pregnant because the sperm will probably already have entered your body by this point.

Q: When will my treatments last?

A: Treatment may take anywhere between 10 weeks to 12 months depending on how well you respond to each dose.

Q: Should I avoid exercise while taking this medication?

A: Exercise can help with the symptoms and improve many health related issues such as weight loss and heart disease. It also helps relieve symptoms associated with depression including anxiety and insomnia. Unfortunately, people who smoke or drink alcohol frequently could experience adverse reactions from the drug which include increased risk of blood clots, stroke, heart attack, and death. If you are concerned about your cardiovascular health, talk to your doctor first before starting any new medications.

Q: Does the drug affect appetite when taken regularly?

A: Most likely yes. A number of studies have been done on patients who had diabetes and were given either metformin or carbamazepine daily (which may cause nausea) and found that their appetites decreased. If you feel like you are constantly hungry but do not eat much, don't give up on eating! Just focus on being more active and making sure that you stay hydrated.

Q: Do I have to stop using this drug if I go into remission from Stage 1 or 2?

A: We know many patients who have gone into remission have continued taking this medication even though they have failed all other therapies available. However, we recommend that you monitor your liver function closely over the next few years so that you can decide if this type of treatment should continue if you choose.

Do NOT give yourself any false hope as it's extremely rare for someone to remain completely cancer free as long as they take metformin for life. That said","the same as stage 3

It has been two years now, and it is still progressing slowly but surely. There have been very few changes since I had the procedure in late 2011; however I am getting better every day - thank you to all who have supported me along this journey!

This was an excellent and informative blog that answered a lot of questions on these issues for women with metastatic double negative breast cancer.","yes (3%)

Yes, 3%

No, 0.1%

In my opinion, the answer is ""no."" The fact that women are more likely to be diagnosed with these cancers after a breast exam and biopsy suggests that there may not be any benefit in this type of procedure. It is important to note that one study found that up to 8 in 10 patients had some degree of improvement following screening mammograms and that approximately 15% experienced at least partial improvement (Borgmann et al., 2002). However, it should be noted that the use of this test could still result in unnecessary radiation exposure. In addition, we don't know how often it's used and what types of radiation it detects (Kaminsky et al., 2004; O'Connor et al., 2003; Riggs & Breslow, 2000).

The second question has two possible answers:

Stage 1: A woman who has received a diagnosis of a BRCA mutation will have an increased risk for developing breast cancer due to mutations found on her cells during cell division. This is also known as a first-stage breast cancer. Some studies suggest that up to 33% of women who have been treated with a hormone therapy will develop breast cancer later in life (Schreiber et al., 2006). Stage 2: Women who undergo breast surgery can have a greater chance of getting a secondary diagnosis of breast cancer because their breasts are usually smaller than normal. They might experience symptoms such as pain, swelling or redness around the nipple (pouching), nipples becoming enlarged, a lump at the site of surgery and/or breast changes. These women may be able to avoid the need for breast cancer screening by avoiding surgeries. The most common type of chest surgery is hysterectomy. For those who choose to have a hysterectomy and do not want to have a repeat examination, they are more likely to get a second diagnosis of breast cancer.


Stage 4: A woman who receives a diagnosis of stage 4 triple negative breast cancer will also have an increased risk for developing cancer. She will probably experience a small increase in the percentage of women with a new diagnosis, but she would almost certainly still receive a follow-up visit from a doctor every year to monitor her progress and to check if the cancer has returned (O'Connor et al., 2003). Breast cancer is estimated to affect about one out of three women in their 40s and 50s, so about half of all women will eventually need","The study was a clinical trial conducted by Dr. Boon and his team of investigators in Thailand from 2009 to 2011, involving approximately 350 patients.

Stage 4 Triple Negative Breast Cancer Treatment - Key Facts

The Stage 4 Triple Negative Breast Cancer Treatment is the most advanced form of radiation therapy for Stage 3 or IV breast cancer that has not responded to conventional chemotherapy or surgery. In this type of treatment, the patient's body is irradiated with X-rays at high energy levels in order to destroy the tumor cells, thus eliminating the risk of relapse after traditional therapies such as surgery. While this may seem similar to standard oncology treatments, there are significant differences between this kind of treatment and typical oncology treatments. The treatment focuses on destroying all cancerous cells but leaves surrounding healthy tissue untouched. Patients have no need to undergo chemotherapy or radiation again. The primary goal is to destroy these tumors completely before they can spread beyond their own organs into other parts of the body, which is why it is called ""Treatment."" As a result, the cancer is treated only once per day and does not require follow up visits or monitoring. It is also possible that the treatment will be stopped if it fails (for example if it spreads outside of the body), but that does not happen often.

How Does Stage 4 Triple Negative Breast Cancer Treat?

As mentioned earlier, the main difference between traditional oncology treatments and Stage 4 triple negative breast cancer treatment is that traditional oncologists generally provide more frequent checkups than doctors who use triple negative treatment. This allows them to get a better idea about how well the cancer is progressing and how much time is left before a new treatment might help to stop its progression. A more accurate picture of the progress is critical because if a tumor reaches stage IV, then it should be treated aggressively. If it continues to progress to stage I, it is important that it be surgically removed, ideally within days of diagnosis. However, in those cases where the disease can't be surgically removed, conventional chemo and/or surgical procedures could still prove beneficial.


What Is Double-Negative vs Single-Negative Breast Tumors?

Double-negative tumors are tumors that contain two different types of DNA, one normal and another abnormal. They are known as double positive cancers. The term single positive means an individual carries both normal and abnormal copies of the genetic material. Both types of tumor are sometimes referred to as triple positive.

Triple Positive Tumors - How","Treatment of stage 4 triple negative breast cancer is based on two types of drugs (TCAs and tamoxifen). TCA's are used to stop the growth of cancer cells which have metastatic potential. They have been shown to be safe in patients with advanced disease, but they may cause side effects such as headache or nausea during chemotherapy. The most common side effect associated with TCA use in women with advanced disease is gastrointestinal upset. In addition to that, a small percentage of women with advanced disease will experience problems related to pregnancy, including miscarriage. Tamoxifen blocks a protein called cyclooxygenase-2 which is involved in transforming breast cancer into other cancers. Because it inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 it prevents tumor cell migration into surrounding areas, resulting in less spread to adjacent areas. So the best option for using tamoxifen in this population is to use tamoxifen at one dose per week instead of four times per week because it helps decrease the risk of pregnancy complications. In addition, if you think that you might have advanced disease then you should talk to your physician about starting tamoxifen at three doses per day at least until the next checkup.

What symptoms do you notice after being treated for triple positive or triple negative breast cancer?

Ask a question

If you're feeling better about yourself or if you haven't experienced any unpleasant symptoms within the last few weeks, go ahead and ask a question!

How long does it take to see some results from your new treatment?

It can vary depending on how many tumors were removed and what type of treatment was used. Many people who start out with a single dose of tamoxifen see significant improvement within 6 months. For example, patients who started off with three tamoxifen treatments saw an average reduction of 13% in their average mammogram scores within six months. Patients taking five or more doses saw a 50% reduction. However, even when you're very successful in getting rid of all of the tumors you still need to monitor your progress closely. Your doctor will want to know how well you responded to each dose of tamoxifen so he or she can decide whether or not you'll continue the therapy. If you've followed a typical treatment plan like we recommend above, there won't likely be any major changes to your regular routine after surgery. And remember, you don't have to wait until the end of the year to see the results of these new therapies. You","The first step is to find out if a particular drug or combination of drugs can help you. If it does, then the next step is to see how many pills to take each day and when to use them. This makes the most sense for patients who have a good prognosis but are at high risk of complications and side effects from chemotherapy. Then they need to decide whether to continue on the same medication or switch over to a different one. This may be the best option if the new therapy seems better than what they had before. If not, they should ask their doctor about switching to a brand-name (brand name=generic), newer form of drug that has fewer adverse effects. For example, some drugs that were used in stage 3/4 cancers like BRCA1 and CCR5 inhibitors have been shown to work well in stage 2/3 tumors. If there's no improvement in the new treatment after several months, your doctor will probably prescribe another drug such as an antiproliferative agent or hormone therapy.","it is still in development.

The ""best"" solution to a specific problem, such as one of the following, may not be the best choice for all patients:

Your tumour has not spread and there are no signs or symptoms of metastasis (breast cancer). The area is stable and you are able to maintain your lifestyle without problems. There is no evidence that another drug or surgery will help. Your surgeon agrees with this decision and you continue on with the same course of treatment. The disease has progressed but the risk of complications like infection is minimal and you are able to continue your treatments for at least 3 years.

For more information about choosing the right treatment plan, please see our Patient Information page.","There are many reasons why the medical community has not approved this option. It is because it is a very complex and expensive procedure that would require much more time than what is necessary to treat stage 4 triple positive breast cancers. When you compare treatments available, you will find that the cost of this type of procedure is about $2,000-$5,000 per year. This may seem like a lot of money, but remember this is not enough for most women who are in need of treatment. The average family income in Texas can easily exceed $100,000/year. If you have a difficult time finding insurance coverage, don't despair. Many hospitals offer this service.

The most important thing to know about cancer chemotherapy is that it does not cure any of your symptoms. If you experience side effects such as nausea or vomiting, these will likely continue until all the cancer cells are removed from the body. Therefore, if you want to stop taking chemo, it's best to do so as soon as possible after diagnosis. This could be as little as one week following surgery or three weeks afterward. After your first round of chemo, it's wise to take a few days off to let your system recover before returning to work. You may also wish to limit your exposure to light during chemo therapy; that way you won't see any changes within the body. Remember that chemotherapy isn't the same as radiation therapy (or radiotherapy). Radiation is used when there is no hope left, while chemotherapy is used when an entire tumor has been removed. However, as we've seen above, all chemo treatments can cause severe physical problems and some people may even go into shock. So always check with your physician before deciding on a course of treatment.

There are several types of chemotherapy drugs currently being used:

Lithium is commonly given as either oral (oral) or intravenous (IV). Lithium is taken orally as a pill. A single dose of lithium pills takes approximately 10 minutes to come down in your bloodstream. If you start out at around 150 milligrams/day of lithium pills (one pill every four hours), by the second day you'll probably be able to take two doses each day. To learn how long it takes you to get back to normal levels of lithium, watch this video: How Long Does Lithium Take to Return Normal?

A single dose of lithium pills","You need to ask about your personal, medical history and whether you have any other diseases. Do not wait until there is a metastatic disease before asking about this. It will be too late for that. Your doctor can tell you what to do.

Q: What if I don't want chemotherapy? Can I just stop taking it?

A: Yes, but the chemo will take longer than normal to work because of the higher levels of hormones in your blood. That's why some people who are using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for their breasts may feel they have more pain during and after treatment; this is not a good sign! The reason why chemotherapy takes so long is because estrogen levels are reduced by HRT in order to lower the risk of ovarian cancer. If you are doing HRT in combination with an anti-estrogen pill or a progesterone injection, you should see your doctor as soon as possible to schedule a follow up appointment at least 6 months after treatment.

If you choose not to use HRT, you will still experience chemotherapy for 1 year; however, it may be much harder to get off the drug because of its side effects. In addition, you will probably experience loss of appetite, increased hair growth and weight gain, and a change in menstrual cycle.

This question also answers questions related to how the patient can safely return to work when she has undergone surgery. When patients are on hormonal therapy, they often become moody, depressed and anxious around time off work. There is no indication that these symptoms would affect your ability to return to work, although if you miss work for extended periods of time it is important to check back with your employer periodically so that you can continue working normally."
119,Question: best pillow neck pain\nAnswer:,"There are a lot of different things that can cause this pain. In some cases, it's because you're using too much weight on your back and your back is tired from sitting at a desk all day long. But if you're not getting enough sleep or are sleeping less than 8 hours per night, there could be other causes as well. If you have insomnia, you may experience chronic pain in the neck muscles that doesn't go away even after taking medicine.

Q: how to treat neck pain?

A: You should try to get plenty of rest while dealing with your neck pain. For example, take frequent naps whenever possible (especially when you're working out). The longer you stay asleep, the more likely it will become harder for you to sleep.

Doing regular stretches helps strengthen your spine and gives your neck muscle better circulation. Try standing up straight, holding one arm over your head with your elbow pointing downwards, and stretching yourself into a stretch position by keeping both arms bent at 90 degrees. Make sure you don't hold your breath as you bend your body!

Wearing compression stockings and wearing loose clothing during bedtime can help ease neck pain. A simple foam roller will give you support which can make an enormous difference. Be careful about the type of cushions you choose though; they tend to compress your skin and sometimes cause discomfort due to pressure points. Also remember to wear comfortable shoes and keep them dry; dampness increases tension and pain. It takes time for your neck to heal, so check with your doctor before trying any exercises.","If the neck is not numb, your neck will be in a more upright position.

Q: how to move my head from side to side?","I have some pretty bad cases where the back of my head is really sore. The most common cause would be when a person wears a sleeveless shirt or dress and then tries to lie down in bed with their legs up on the side (like this), or even worse, when they try to lay in bed with their knees up to their chest (this has been happening recently). That being said, it can also happen if you are sitting too close together, if you're trying to sleep while your leg is at an angle, or if you sit too long. If you feel any discomfort or pain that isn't caused by anything else, stop using your pillows immediately.


Best way to avoid pain is to simply not wear these pillows! The best thing to do is to check out our list of great pillowcases, especially those that are easy to clean. We love the VF pillowcase because it's made from 100% cotton fabric. When you take it off, you'll find that there aren't many wrinkles left behind. However, we still recommend that you take care when you get home after wearing the pillowcase. It's much easier for you to roll it over than to remove all the wrinkles and creases, so don't wait until they start to come back before doing this step. Just like all of our pillows, they come unmade; however, once you've used them enough times, they will become completely machine washable. They won't smell bad at all, and you should be able to see no sign of mold or mildew. Lastly, let us know what other kinds of fabrics you prefer using in the comments section below!


Other Questions about Pillows

Q: Why don't the pillows fit me?A: Because sometimes our fabric doesn't always go through the seams as quickly as we'd like. Sometimes it takes more time than we expected to make sure everything fits right. Most people have experienced this at one point or another. Our customer service team is always here to help!You can contact us anytime to verify exactly how the mattress works, to ask questions, or just to give us feedback. Please note that we may need to re-order certain sizes depending on demand, but we'll gladly refund any costs if you contact us within 24 hours after ordering.","You can't just roll up the sheets and say ""Oh yeah, I have this terrible neck problem"". A lot of things will happen to your head which may cause you to have a bad neck. One thing is that you may feel it when you're sleeping or waking up - this could be from blood vessels in your brain that are getting clogged with fluid or from an infection. If all else fails, then try to relieve some pressure by lying flat on your back so you don't get as much pressure in there too. Also try to relax and slow down the breathing. Most people find this helps a lot.

If you can only use one pillow for comfort, here's what you should do:


I would recommend this pillow case as it has good padding for the bottom (this does not mean it will be comfortable). The main drawback I've found is that the foam cushioning seems to absorb more water than other similar products such as this. This isn't a big deal because you probably won't need that much but if you like to get wet, I think you'll enjoy using it.

Pros: It doesn't smell like anything, especially if you sleep outside. I've never had issues with my pillows smelling like nothing at all although I'd love to come across something. They're waterproof and have no odor at all - it's not exactly luxurious but I usually wash them in warm running water after each use. They also dry quickly so you can put them away easily without having to worry about getting stains from sweaty skin. They don't move around a lot while being worn. This means you shouldn't have any problems finding a good spot for them under your mattress. It also makes for excellent travel pillow for long trips where you want to keep one side folded over while your suitcase lies flat against the wall to avoid any bumps or crevices. And for those who don't care much for travel pillows they really aren't a bother.


Cons: Again, this is a cons list since I haven't actually used these but it seems that most people are complaining about the same thing; the fact that they have to pull out their batteries to charge them every night. That being said they are rechargeable with two AA batteries or three AAA batteries. As far as I know there is no way to charge them fast enough to last a whole week but if you're going to be traveling then it is worth trying.


Conclusion: I wouldn't say this is the best pillow ever made but I do","a) If you can manage it, then don't worry. b) If you have it so bad that you get headaches and other discomfort every night, then you should seek medical help. c) Even if your pillows hurt like crazy at night, do not panic. Your pillows are just trying to warn you that something is wrong with you or the pillow you use, but nothing more than that. I know of many people who have had pillows cause them pain for years and even decades before they knew what was going on. d) There are lots of different kinds of pillows out there, some good (like these ones), others bad (the kind that look like an old pair of slippers). They all work differently, however, so ask the person selling them how well they would take them as a replacement. E) A pillow will not make you feel better immediately, only over time. It may be difficult to sleep through a hard night, but eventually you'll find your pillow helps you fall asleep. F) As long as your pillow stays comfortable, it's unlikely anything else will either. That is why I always recommend buying one pillow with both sides removed - even better when you order multiple sizes!G) Pillow covers often leak moisture or oil onto their surfaces, which causes them to wick away water. I advise against this because there's a possibility of skin irritation and/or breakouts. H) The color of your pillow, if not white, will affect its ability to keep you dry. I prefer a light blue color, though in warmer climates this might not matter much. I also recommend getting a new pillow cover each year if you buy a new pillow.I) Some pillows are too big to wear comfortably, especially those with large heads, since their necks tend to rub together. If your pillow doesn't fit, try taking it off, keeping it on until you get used to it and then put it back on again.J) Most pillows come with a removable headband, either from the manufacturer or from another brand. Don't assume you'll need to remove it for proper sleeping comfort.K) Always start sleeping with the left side facing up. This ensures you won't wake up with right side awake, since the mattress will stretch on its own.L) Use a pillow case, even a small box pillow case, because it keeps dust and dirt off your pillow. Maintaining your pillowcase will prevent you from having to clean it regularly.M) Never share your pillows","not sure...I think that this is more related to the shape of your neck than anything else.The reason I'm asking is because, if you have a very large area and you put the pillow on it is it will hit the sides of the head and cause some pain in the side of your head. It's also possible for your neck to swell up or shift.

And the answer is: There are many different things you can do about this:


-You could use an adjustable pillow, which would allow you to set the height slightly above your jawline, and give you a comfortable fit with no problem at all.

-Or you could get one of those high neck pillows that looks like something out of a movie (I don't know if they're still around) and keep it up so that it doesn't fall down when you try to sleep.

-You could always lie on your back, but this might be uncomfortable for your neck to handle when you have a wide area of neck pressure.

-Finally, there is something called ""cable tension"", which involves tying a small knot under your hair and then tightening it by pulling and pushing until you feel the knot pop free from your scalp without any pain. If you'd rather just go with wearing a loose shirt and pants you can try doing this. The main thing to remember is that if you want to wear a loose shirt and pants you should wear them long enough so that the collar is going to hang loose.If you've done all of these things (and your neck hurts while sleeping), you probably won't need to worry about it as much anymore. The most important thing to note here though is that it usually helps to rest after using the pillow, whether it's a pillow, foam, etc., so it's worth trying to rest in between uses.","You can use a heavy weight to compress the neck in this case. If you are going to be using something like an over-the-head pillow, try not to do it too tightly as that might cause it to move around.

Injury or swelling of the throat (throat pain)

There is no specific medical reason for the throat being sore and/or swollen. Some people get a little red mark on their cheeks when they have a cold, but most will never notice anything if it's only there for a few days. The same goes for the throat. Some people just feel sore or tender after coughing. It's perfectly normal and fine. There may also be some inflammation and redness, especially if you've had a cold before.

If your cough gets worse than usual, see your doctor or other health care provider about what's wrong with you. They'll probably give you some advice as to how to treat it.

Anxiety

The feeling of anxiety often accompanies any type of chronic stress. For example, you're worried about your job getting cut off or how you're going to pay rent in six months. This could lead you into panic attacks which is why anxiety medications are recommended for those who suffer from these kinds of problems. Anxiety symptoms can last from hours to days and include:

Feelings of anxiety

Fear or worry

Agitation

Difficulty concentrating

Increased heart rate and blood pressure

Sweating or dry mouth

Dizziness or lightheadedness

Headaches

Restlessness

Nausea

Mood swings

Irritability

Trouble sleeping

Rash

Skin rashes

Itching and irritation in the skin

Lack of energy

Achy muscles

Weight loss

Diarrhea

When to seek help?

You should talk with someone if you have any of the following signs. These include:

Chronic anxiety

Severe physical or mental illness

Sleeping too much, even for a short time

Not eating, drinking, or exercising enough

Physical pain due to disease or injury

Feeling anxious or restless for no apparent reason

Stress that's interfering with everyday activities

This list doesn't go on forever, so don't despair yet! Remember though that things aren't always fixed immediately. Sometimes your body needs time to heal itself back to its original state","If you have a very bad neck and neck muscles that are hard to get used to, don't use this pillow. You will be fine if you take the night before your bedtime or at least a few hours after it comes off. The same goes for shoulders. Your shoulder muscles can easily tire from sleeping on a tight blanket. Just sleep in loose sheets.

Another answer: The biggest problem with these pillows is they are too bulky! I'm 5'10"", 270 lbs., but my wife and I have a pretty average sized mattress. Even so, we still need to keep them pretty small because of how heavy they are. We're trying to go light, but our pillow just doesn't fit in the space we're using. Any other suggestions?","You can get a pain relief pill or even some pain pills to stop the pain. If you feel the pain and it's not really bad, go for it!

Solution: I don't think that it is wise to put your back into the pillows. It will only make it worse by causing more pressure in the neck region and can actually cause more damage than good as you will have to sit on your head all day long. Make sure to keep a pillow under the arm so if you need an injection you don't hurt yourself.

Answer: You are right. Don't put your back into the pillows. The whole point of using them is to relieve your tension and keep you comfortable. Do put the back of your hand over the top of your head so you don't cut yourself off from blood flow and oxygenation.

Hope this helps with your questions. If there are any queries leave a comment below","No, not really. It's more of a case of the pain is not due to the pillow but rather because your neck muscles are tired after a long day. I've noticed that people with the same symptoms who don't sleep on their backs actually have worse back pain than people who do.

121,Question: numb fingers arthritis\nAnswer:,"If your finger is completely numb, you should not use this product. If the numbness goes away after one month, then it's OK.

The most common reason for using this product is for arthritis of the hands or feet (fascia).


When we first started working with our clients about the symptoms they had when having to work in a very cold climate, it was obvious that people were suffering from extreme pain on their hands and feet. After several months of talking about this issue with some medical professionals, we realized there might be other factors at play as well, so we decided to investigate further into how this disease affects different skin areas on humans. The research has shown that even in situations where temperature drops to the freezing point or below, the body still does its best to keep us warm through sweating. The skin surrounding our joints contains large amounts of blood vessels which are constantly pumping blood throughout all of our tissues. In order to maintain proper blood flow, these vessels must stay warm enough during the day. We've discovered that the muscles around our wrists are particularly sensitive to this condition because they have more of these small blood vessels than anywhere else in the body. When these arteries become stiff, it can lead to painful and sometimes severe symptoms such as tingling, burning, stiffness, swelling and loss of feeling. As the circulation within these veins gets blocked or slowed down by muscle weakness, we experience what many call ""cold"" wrist pains.


This type of problem happens when the muscles around the joints stop producing sufficient blood to replace the lost fluid, which results in a drop in blood pressure. In addition to preventing the blood supply from getting too low, muscles are also responsible for distributing heat through the system. This means that if the sweat glands aren't fully functional, the skin becomes excessively cold, leading to pain. Most often, patients report numbness and/or burning sensations in their hand/foot area while wearing this product. However, if you feel itchy or irritated on the affected area, it may be due to an infection and need to see your doctor immediately. Also, if a patient complains that she feels like her hand is turning blue, you need to take it seriously. It could be inflammation, scarring or even cancer!


What causes numb fingers?

There are two main types of arthritis. One is called fibromyalgia and another is osteoarthritis. Fibromyalgia affects approximately 25% of women and 15% of men and is associated with problems such as headaches, back","If you have a stiff, cold finger and get it infected or irritated in some way, then you can see what happens to your nerves.

If the nerve gets inflamed, that means there's infection in some part of the nerve that may be making the pain worse (called perineal inflammation). The infection makes blood vessels harder and causes swelling in the affected area. The increased pressure increases the chances for scarring that will eventually lead to scar formation, which can cause more serious problems than just an infection itself.

You'll probably need antibiotic treatment if you have this problem with either your toe or foot because it could spread to other parts of your body as well. You'll also likely need to wear protective shoes (e.g., orthotics) so you won't break your foot off or have a broken bone. And you might need to take medication while you're treating it to prevent its reoccurrence.","yes there are two types of arthritic pain. One is the type where it feels like your finger is bleeding all over the place, this is called ""pain in the thumb"". The other is when you have to pick up a heavy object and suddenly the back of your hand feels numb or even as if something has fallen out of it. It's caused by the loss of blood that normally comes from the arteries and veins in the hands. If you don't get enough blood flow to the area, it can cause an inflammation, causing the pain.The most common causes for these kinds of wrist problems are: poor posture, poor sleep, low testosterone levels, diabetes (especially if you smoke), trauma (like falls or whiplash), sports injuries (like boxing, football or baseball) and car accidents.There are also many medications available that could help with chronic or recurrent symptoms.

If you're having persistent swelling of the fingers, they may also be due to tissue damage, such as swelling around nerve endings, which occur after several years of repetitive stress. These muscles become less elastic, so the pressure on them increases, making them more likely to swell. Tissue damage also occurs through friction between collagen fibers in skin cells, which leads to scarring and eventually scar formation.

It should also be noted that the majority of patients who experience pain in the middle finger have some form of arthritis, but not everyone does. Most people who do have arthritis in their middle finger tend to never develop it. As mentioned earlier, the first symptom of arthritic pain is numbness and tingling in the affected areas, which usually dissipates within a few months. Some people will still experience stiffness and tightness of the joint(s).","A. No it's not. If you have numb fingers or toes, these can be a sign of another condition called ""magnificent"" disease which is usually caused by inflammation of the feet and ankles.","It's more common for people with this type of pain to develop arthritis in the hands than it is on their feet.

Q: What causes that?

A: People with numb fingers have a genetic defect called NIDDM (non-specific diabetic neuropathy). Some of those affected by the disease don't know they are having it, and some of them do. That can make things worse by making the bones in your fingers soft, which increases the chance of developing osteoarthritis.

There may be other factors involved, but the most likely ones are:

Age - Older adults tend to have more of these types of joints because they often get older before they experience symptoms.

Stress - It seems like the body doesn't respond well to stress, so any sudden change in our environment might cause us to become stressed too much. This makes our bodies less able to heal and could lead to another problem later in life, or even a premature death.

Mood changes - Mood problems can affect the immune system. When we're feeling down, it leads to higher levels of inflammation, which can worsen the condition over time.

What you can do about it:

1. You can try to avoid stress if possible by getting enough rest.

2. If you find yourself experiencing pain in the middle of everyday activities, talk to your doctor about ways to prevent future joint problems.

3. If you feel yourself becoming weaker when sitting or standing, sit down at least 30 minutes every day.


If you've been diagnosed with NIDDM, there are two steps you need to take right away:

You'll probably have a physical exam conducted. These tests will check whether there are abnormalities in your blood sugar level, including low levels of insulin, and other markers of diabetes. In addition, many doctors will order an endocrinologist's test if they suspect NIDDM. This exam will look at how your hormones work inside your body to regulate your metabolism and blood pressure and will help them better understand how your health affects your risk for heart disease and certain cancers. Your doctors will also want to see your glucose tolerance test. This test is done periodically to monitor how well your body absorbs glucose from food as part of your daily diet. The test involves taking a sample of the fluid surrounding your pancreas that helps regulate your blood sugar levels. You'll also have a blood test taken. A urine analysis of cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and","You can cure it in one of two ways. 1) Get some kind of a cold water treatment like chlorophyll or B-vitamins to help heal the wound and then after you get all the blood out of your finger, wash that same finger with alcohol and let them dry for about 10 minutes, this will release any remaining bacteria from inside of the wound.

2) If your hand is not completely healed already, you need to make sure that there are no parasites living inside of it. For example if you have a parasite like ringworm or flea in your hand then you need to remove those insects on top of your hand which can infect your skin.

3) When you cut yourself at night, you should get a lot of blood and put some blood on the open wound so that it heals better. Then go back home and repeat the above steps until you get a good results.","When you have a tendon tear, the ligaments and tendons can't extend beyond the point of rupture. The muscle tissue is also stretched too far to hold up the bone. This causes pain in your finger joints as well.

Your doctor may prescribe corticosteroids (which are medicines that reduce inflammation) or anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen). If this doesn't help, they will probably recommend surgery to repair the torn tendon(s). Surgery is usually done under general anesthesia, so it's important to make sure that you're comfortable while being sedated.

When does an athlete need knee replacement surgery?

An athlete who has sustained ACL injury during any sport should be seen by their primary care physician. An athlete with acute trauma (like a car accident) might require knee reconstruction or joint arthroscopy.

After a traumatic event, patients usually need reconstructive surgery to fix a fractured leg.

An MRI scan or other x-ray helps doctors determine the best way to repair the damaged knee joint. Most sports injuries heal completely within two months after the injury. However, if surgery isn't recommended because the injured area has not healed properly, cortisone injections are used for short periods of time until healing begins again.","you can use ice packs and hot water. You have a cold sore so it will be good to stay out of the sun, and you should apply warm-up ointment or cream before going out.The key is to relax your muscles for at least 30 minutes every day with an ice pack (or more if necessary) on the back. This will help relieve pain and inflammation in your wrist, forearm and fingers.If you are having any trouble taking your medication because of this soreness, ask your doctor if there is anything he/she could do to relieve the pain.

The doctor will put a tiny piece of metal into your hand, and see what happens when he touches his index finger to your thumb. It should come out limp at first, but then it may become stiff and hard as he tries to touch it. This shows that there is some damage, so the doctor needs to take the thing out immediately. When it does, take off the bandage, and call your doctor right away.

Q: I am having trouble swallowing my food. Why?

A: There are several reasons for this, but one has to do with how long your stomach has been empty. Your throat should feel dry and full after eating. After that, the digestion starts all over again until you feel full again, which takes about 5 minutes. That means you've eaten less than 15% of the meal!

The same goes for beverages such as water and tea. They usually contain an extremely small amount of liquid in them, so it just takes another 10-15 seconds before you feel full. As soon as you begin feeling full again, drink more, because you're basically going to need it again. (But really, that little bit of liquid is not important, and you shouldn't worry about the extra calories.) Once you start drinking more, keep doing this, and eventually the urge to eat goes away without much effort. The point here is to start out slow and build up to the point where you only have to stop once every 20-30 minutes. That way, you won't be tempted to go back to what you were thinking was delicious."
123,Question: hypothyroidism symptoms\nAnswer:,"""I am a very experienced doctor who has treated many patients with hypothyroidism. I have found that the symptoms are most often related to a decreased thyroid hormone (T3) level in the body.""

A simple test is to take TSH levels. The higher your TSH, the more likely you are to experience hypothyroid symptoms and an increased risk of heart disease.

In other words, if you are not taking any medications that interfere with thyroxine levels then you are likely to be able to handle hypothyroid symptoms without having side effects, or for at least a few months.

If you want to know if you might be suffering from a low thyroid hormone, it's best to visit your doctor or go online to the Thyroid Center (www.thyroidcenter.com). They can give you a quick assessment of your condition so that you can make an informed decision about what treatment options will work best for you.","Yes, the doctor will determine whether you are experiencing a thyroid problem. Your body is unable to produce enough thyroid hormone by itself and it's called hypo-thyroidism. The good news is that your body can be made aware of any problems. In fact, if it does not respond appropriately to treatment with T4, your doctor may suggest an increased dose of T3 to see what effect this has on your condition.

Hypothyroidism Symptoms

The most common type of hypothyroidism is undiagnosed or underdiagnosed; i.e., someone who isn't sure about their diagnosis because they don't feel like they have anything wrong. People with undiagnosed hypothyroidism may experience fatigue, weight loss, depression, memory impairment, lack of energy, irregular menstrual periods, low libido, changes in appetite, irritability, loss of hair, dry skin, difficulty concentrating, headaches, muscle pain, joint pains, insomnia and other symptoms.

Symptoms of undiagnosed hypothyroidism include:

Fatigue, feeling tired all the time

Loss of interest/memory

Decreased strength and stamina

Insomnia

Headaches

Depression, mood swings, sadness and feelings of worthlessness

Joint pain

Muscle weakness

Slow growth (due to decreased sex drive)

Mood swings

Low body temperature (or hot flashes)

Muscle aches

Weight loss

Poor concentration

When the doctor suspects that you might be suffering from a thyroid disorder, he or she may perform some tests including blood work, blood pressure, urine analysis and liver function testing. These tests reveal the exact cause of the symptoms for those with undiagnosed hypothyroidism.

If the test results show that there is a problem with your thyroid gland, then the doctor may prescribe an over the counter thyroid medication, such as Levothyroxine (also known as L-Tylenol). This medication increases the production of thyroglobulin and T4 in your body to help regulate the thyroid gland. If you take T4 alone, the levels in your bloodstream are too high and cause you to experience symptoms similar to those experienced by people without hypothyroidism. However, if you do have severe low levels of T4, your doctor should evaluate you closely. Thyroid surgery, which involves removing parts of the thyroid gland so that it produces less hormones","it's a symptom of thyroid problems.

The more detailed the better! Don't worry about being wrong - just provide enough information so that your doctor knows what he/she should be looking into when treating you for hypo-thyroidism.","Hypothyroidism is a disease of the thyroid, which produces hormones that regulate metabolism and energy production. People with severe or chronic hypothyroidism have abnormal levels of these hormones in their blood.

You may be able to get help from your doctor if you are having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep during the day, experiencing memory problems such as forgetting important tasks, feeling tired all the time, eating too much or not getting enough sleep, being irritable and moody, having headaches or dizziness, losing weight rapidly, or getting headaches when you drink alcohol. If you suffer from these symptoms, talk to your doctor about options for treatment.

If you are not sure whether you have hypothyroidism, see your doctor. If you think you might have hypothyroidism, tell your doctor right away so he or she can rule out other causes. The best way to diagnose hypothyroidism is with an ultrasound (an instrument used to look at your body), called an echocardiogram (also known as a sinus scan). This test looks at how blood vessels work inside your heart. You should ask your doctor what kind of tests will be done if you suspect you have low thyroid function.

Causes

Hypothyroidism is caused by changes in the size, shape and/or structure of your thyroid gland. A deficiency in thyroid hormone may cause your thyroid tissue to become abnormally thin or develop cancer cells. Some people don't make enough thyroid hormone; others may have excess iodine (iodine) in their bodies. These conditions are called hypothyroidism-associated diseases (HAADs). They include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, Graves' ophthalmopathy, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis associated with iodine deficiency. Another condition called Hashimoto's syndrome is also sometimes confused with hypothyroidism but is really related to poor growth in thyroids. Other conditions like hyperthyroidism, hypomagnesemia (high potassium), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), and hyperprolactinemia (too little protein in your bloodstream) can cause similar problems.

What causes hypothyroidism?

There are three main types of thyroid disorders:

Primary hyperthyroidism. The most common cause of this disorder is a congenital abnormality of the pituitary gland or a genetic mutation (inherited genes) that disrupts normal pituitary development. This results in a small, underdeveloped","yes.

A: This is a very common, but it's not an answer to your question. I don't have any reason to doubt that you're the only one who has this problem; it might be more widespread than what you think, though. I'm sure there are people out there with less severe symptoms who also have this. There's no cure for it. It will go away on its own if treated properly.","Your thyroid gland has been affected. You may have a deficiency of thyroid hormones in your body and that is what causes your symptoms (especially if you're female). It's important to see a doctor who can treat it properly so that you don't need any medication for the rest of your life.

If you believe you might be having low thyroid hormone levels, your doctor will test you by putting a drop on a small cotton pad under the skin where it would naturally go down into the thyroid gland or an endoscope tube (a needle-like device) through your neck or back onto one part of your thyroid gland at a time. If a positive result comes up, then you should get more iodine. This is called a TSH test. If your results are too high (as they can sometimes happen), then you'll need to take T3 supplements or possibly thyroid surgery (to make sure the pituitary gland is producing enough thyroid hormones). Check out the links below for more information about low thyroid levels.","It depends on the individual, but you can sometimes feel a little dizzy or have mild headache. Some people may even experience fatigue and/or malaise. If you notice any of these symptoms after starting your thyroid medication, see your doctor immediately.

[top]

I just want to know why my symptoms are different from those of someone with normal TSH.

Hypothyroidism symptoms may not be as common in females because of female reproductive hormones. You also should not assume that a person with hypothyroidism has high levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). People who don't produce SHBG often have low TSH values (less than 7.0 mIU/L), which may indicate an increased level of estrogen or progesterone and/or a lowered production of DHEAS (the hormone responsible for converting testosterone into estradiol) by the liver, adrenal glands, pituitary gland, and testicles. There is no evidence linking elevated TSH levels to estrogen or progesterone problems, and some studies suggest that higher TSH levels may be associated with increased risk of developing prostate cancer.[1] [2][3]

What causes hypothyroidism?

While it's clear that thyroid function plays a role in determining whether one develops hypothyroidism or not, the exact mechanism behind this relationship is unclear.[4][5] One possibility is that abnormalities of the hypothalamus (a region within the brain involved in regulating body temperature), as well as the immune system, lead to an imbalance of the thyroid hormone receptors (TRs).[6][7] While there is no conclusive evidence of this theory, it seems likely to explain at least part of the variation in hypothyroid symptoms found between individuals.

Another possible explanation involves the action of a thyroid hormone called thyroxine. Thyroid hormones are produced mainly by the thyroid gland. However, some cells in the body produce more T 3 than others. A specific type of cell in the pituitary gland makes large quantities of TRs, whereas other cells make smaller amounts of TRs. This means that certain types of cells, such as the microtubule transport system (MTTS), get their energy from circulating T 4 and thus require extra iodine to function properly. Another area where this is true is in the kidneys, where TRs do need to be made up of T 3, though they're not converted into T 4 directly. To compensate, thyroid hormone also requires additional","I've had this problem for about 2 years now and have tried everything to get it under control. I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis in May of 2014, and the thyroid hormone test result came back negative on July 5th of that year (I'm 32). Since then, my blood work has come back negative as well, so I know they can't be thyroid related.

After a few more tests, it became apparent I still had elevated levels of TSH/TSH; which are usually normal for someone with a healthy thyroid gland. My doctor ordered some blood tests to see if there was something else going on. They found high levels of C-reactive protein, a biomarker for inflammation, which is extremely common when you have a chronic disease like Hashimoto's or autoimmune thyroiditis, so these were all positive. The only surprise in the whole thing is the low thyroxine level – because that should go up with age! He also discovered a history of unexplained fatigue from being too weak to exercise regularly (the usual culprit here) and his wife's constant complaining about her loss of energy and the same symptoms. He gave me an anti-thyroid medication and told me not to worry about it, since he knows I'm just doing what nature intended. However, I got pretty concerned after reading the results of my initial blood test, and started looking into other possible causes. As most people do, I read up on the internet, searched medical journals, talked to friends, etc. I found lots of articles saying this condition isn't real, that everyone who has it has been eating way too many animal products, that certain herbs help, etc. After a while, I decided I'd had enough and wanted to take matters into my own hands by trying to figure out why. There were many different things that could be causing me to experience these symptoms, but none of them seemed to fit together nicely. When we tested both my husband and myself, our bodies told us we each had slightly higher than normal C-Reactivity values; and our TSH levels weren't quite where they normally would be without being hyperthyroid. We discussed this with my mom, who suggested I look at a few studies on this topic. She recommended taking a small amount of supplements that might make a difference, so I did. One of those supplements is called DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), which actually helps our body convert omega-3 fats into their longer chain form. It may be able to alleviate","no, not at all. I am healthy and have never had any hypothyroid symptoms. I don't even know why you would think that. I'm perfectly normal.

Hypothyroidism is caused by an underactive thyroid gland in the body. The main symptom of hypothyroidism is a decrease of blood levels of T3 (the hormone responsible for producing thyroid hormones) or thyroxine (T4). Also called hypo-thyroidism, it's common among some people with hyperthyroidism.","yes \r

Hypothyroidism can cause a number of physical and mental health issues. It's generally not a good idea to have more than one thyroid in your body, especially if you are pregnant or trying for a baby. A diagnosis of hyperthyroidism should be confirmed by medical professionals who examine both the thyroxine (T4) levels as well as other signs like depression, lethargy, sleep disturbances, loss of appetite, weight gain, headache, fatigue, increased hair growth on the head and chest, poor concentration, nausea/vomiting, heart palpitations and constipation. You'll want to see an endocrinologist, particularly if you're also taking medication for depression or anxiety disorders. Read my article about the effects of hypothyroidism on pregnancy here. And check out this link about how to properly diagnose hypothyroidism.


The above question is also relevant because many women with thyroid conditions will experience similar symptoms. If they don't want to go through the pain and worry that accompanies going off their medications then it might be worth looking into options such as natural herbs or supplements. Check out this website for more information on natural treatments for thyroid problems. The following questions may sound rather silly but are very important to understand so you know whether to take them seriously or dismiss them as just being ""misunderstood"". For example, how do you tell when someone has hypothyroidism? Is there even a difference between hypo and hypothyroidism? Do people develop hypothyroidism at different rates and does the severity of symptoms change over time? Does hypothyroidism occur frequently or only during certain periods of time and why? What about autoimmune diseases like Hashimoto's disease, Graves' Disease, lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis, which all share common underlying causes? What is considered normal thyroid function and how much thyroid hormone production should we expect? These are all important questions to ask yourself if you are thinking of seeking treatment for hypothyroidism. I hope these answers help!"
126,Question: birth control suppression antral follicle count\nAnswer:,"The data I'm seeing are that women on low-dose combined oral contraceptives (COCs) have about 1.5 to 2 microliters of a hormone in their blood per day, while those taking the lowest dose injectable forms of hormonal contraception (IUDs and implants) have about 0.6 to 0.8 milligrams. So for one month, you'll be getting about 3.3 to 5.2 micrograms of progesterone.

What's more, the researchers found that when it came to overall health outcomes, COC users were likely to live longer than nonusers—and there was no difference between male and female participants. For example, men with the highest levels of progesterone had an average lifespan six years longer than those without it.

There's also some evidence that a higher level of progesterone could decrease your risk of heart disease. It appears that high progesterone is associated with a lower incidence of coronary artery disease in women, says Dr. Gertrude Albrecht, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn. That means it may be possible to lower your risk if you're on COCs or another type of hormonal contraceptive.

But there's also plenty of evidence that a woman can get too much progesterone. Studies indicate that women who regularly use long-term hormonal contraceptives don't generally experience adverse side effects like breast enlargement or uterine bleeding. However, if you need regular doses of progestin to prevent pregnancy or you suffer from problems such as acne, excessive hair growth, and irregular periods, you may want to consider a different method.

Dr. Gertrude Albrecht has found that she often finds that older women, especially those with severe acne, tend not to benefit from the daily dose of progesterone. She suggests that it might help to use a combination of two types of hormones in order to achieve desired results.","1. No it's not, your body does not produce testosterone and female hormones to be in the blood stream. Your body makes estrogen from other chemicals in your diet and in your urine that you excrete into the water. This is called aldosterone (or estradiol). You need only one drop of this for every two ejaculations or five drops per day for 12-14 months if you are taking oral contraceptives.

2. Yes, but we know the male pattern of erectile dysfunction. It can start as early as puberty. There is research that shows about 50% of men who suffer this problem will have prostate cancer when they die. That is why it's important to get checked by your doctor. However there aren't many drugs on the market that work as well or as cheaply at treating these problems. Most antiandrogens such as Propecia will cause some side effects such as low libido or depression. There is also no proven treatment for the symptoms of delayed ejaculation.","Yes, with the exception of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). If you are on HRT, take a break from your contraceptive.

What is hormonal contraception?

How does it work?

Estrogen is an active substance in your body that stimulates ovulation. It works by binding to receptors on the surface of cells and blocking their activity so they can no longer produce the hormones needed for conception. The most common type of estrogen in use today is synthetic estradiol, or EE. The pill contains the synthetic version of estrogen called ethinylestradiol, which is also known as EE2.

What are the side effects of hormonal contraception?

Most women who choose to stop taking birth control pills do not experience any serious side effects. However, there have been reports that women experienced nausea, breast tenderness, stomach ache, cramping or cramps after stopping oral contraceptives. You may still need periodic tests to check for pregnancy, but these tests may show signs of abnormal development of your uterus and fallopian tubes. When you stop using birth control pills, you will be advised to see your doctor every three months to monitor what is happening to your reproductive system.

Should I tell my employer about my decision to discontinue use of birth control pills?

Yes! Employees should understand that their employer has the right to make changes to their work schedules based on company policy. They must inform their employer of their plans at least 48 hours before those planned changes begin and if possible the day of change. Employers may consider health insurance coverage of contraceptive services and devices for their employees, if applicable.

Why didn't I mention that birth control pills contain estrogen in my job application or interview?

Before submitting your resume, please read carefully through all questions. If your answer includes any reference to birth control pills, it will probably cause concern among employers. This is true even though some companies offer financial incentives such as bonuses for female applicants. Many schools and universities require candidates to disclose information regarding contraceptive options when applying to school. In addition, many employers provide information about workplace benefits and policies regarding employee access to reproductive healthcare. Please don't forget to include any of this information in your resume.

Can I get pregnant while taking birth control pills?

No. Birth control pills only prevent sperm from fertilizing eggs. If you become pregnant while using birth control pills, it's usually because you had unprotected sex during your period and got pregnant. Because birth control pills cannot","You can get an accurate reading by taking a measurement with a digital or analog thermometer. If you have an irregular period, check for an ovulation test.","The pregnancy rate of women who use oral contraceptives is about half that of those using injectable methods, such as the pill. There are no reliable studies on the effectiveness and safety of the two types of contraception. (2)

The smaller the number, the more days you have to go without sex,"" says Dr. John Kullmann, MD, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Harvard Medical School and one of the authors of the study.

Other Questions

Q1: what if I want to delay or stop my regular monthly cycle?

A1: There are no studies showing that this affects your risk of breast cancer. However, there have been studies on whether stopping a woman's cycle early can lead to uterine fibroids. In one study, women with a history of irregular bleeding were six times more likely to develop uterine fibroid tumors than women whose cycles started at normal (non-menstrual) times. This study was conducted in Japan and China, where ovulation usually happens in the late afternoon, between 3:30 and 6 p.m., as opposed to the usual midmorning or evening time for most women. It seems that hormonal changes during pregnancy are linked to the development of ovarian fibroids because these changes occur in women with a high frequency of menstruation. There are also several studies linking hormone levels to the risk of developing uterine fibroids. The effects of hormone replacement therapy on the risk of developing uterine fibroids was studied in two trials, which showed that women receiving hormones had lower rates of uterine fibroids compared with women not receiving hormones. Women who started their periods after age 25 were eight times less likely to get uterine fibroids than those starting before age 25. These findings are consistent with other evidence suggesting that menstrual cycles can increase uterine weight. Researchers theorize that estrogen can cause blood vessels to expand, leading to higher uterine weights, and they believe that long-term use of hormonal contraception will reduce the risk of uterine fibroids. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not regulate hormonal contraceptives. In addition, although the FDA does review the labeling on hormonal contraceptive products, there is currently no regulation of labeling for hormonal contraceptive preparations containing progestins or estrogens. Some experts think that the FDA needs to establish standards regarding how labels should describe potential side effects from medications and treatments used during the first trimester of pregnancy. There is a recent case study about a woman with severe acne who developed ovarian cysts after using an intrauterine device. Although there was no known cause for her condition, she was prescribed a nonhormonal treatment regimen, including topical medications, which caused her uterus to swell significantly. A","I think I've had a pretty good experience with the FSH/estradiol, and have been on both for about three months now.I'm not sure if this is correct but my last cycle started off very hard as it was only 8 days after ovulation when we saw the first hint of a pregnancy. It's been fine ever since!There are some things that can help with getting pregnant (and also avoiding having an unplanned miscarriage) during this time:1) Start using progesterone around day 20-22.2) Use estrogen from day 28-31 3) If you're trying to get pregnant, try one of these methods:1a) Depo-Provera 2b) IUDs (if your partner has one).3) Pregnancy tests such as amniocentesis or chlamydia screening at least every two weeks.4) There is no way that you will be able to conceive if you don't take any medications to prevent pregnancy.5) Most importantly - never stop taking medication until you reach your due date!In summary: The fertility benefit of stopping taking all meds is a lot less than most people realize, especially in the beginning. It takes about eight weeks to start seeing the benefits after all the symptoms of menopause go away.","2.2%

Question: Can I take a daily probiotic pill? Answer: Yes, if you are taking a prescription medication for diarrhea and/or constipation.

Question: Can I have my period without an appointment? Answer: No. If your period is more than four days long, or occurs on consecutive days, you need to see your doctor immediately. You may also be referred to a reproductive endocrinologist who can perform tests that can determine the cause of irregular periods. Your gynecological physician will evaluate whether your current contraceptive methods are suitable for you.

Question: How often do I need Pap smears? Answer: In most cases, you only need one per year. However, in those circumstances where your health insurance does not cover pap screening, you should discuss with your provider the possibility of seeking Pap testing through an alternative means (e.g., self-pap testing). This information should help you choose the test(s) that best meet your personal needs and goals.


If your healthcare provider determines that you should undergo another Pap smear, you must schedule this visit before the next scheduled exam. Once the procedure has been completed, you may begin using oral contraceptives again.


You should continue to use condoms during sexual intercourse during any Pap smear, even after having had sex, until you find out about any negative pregnancy test results. The purpose of a Pap smear is to detect abnormalities such as cancer cells (a Pap smear cannot tell when you were pregnant), abnormal uterine bleeding, ovarian cysts, and other medical conditions that could affect your ability to become pregnant or lead to miscarriage. After a Pap smear is performed, it is important to follow up with your healthcare provider regularly so that he or she knows what is being done to prevent future pregnancies from occurring and how to proceed with treatment. The following types of Pap smear are recommended:The following guidelines can assist you in choosing between these different options:","1.

They work great on my Macbook Pro.","Yes, you have to wear them. I'm wearing mine right now. They're really useful. Answer: You could just use a pair of sunglasses, but I wouldn't recommend it. A good pair of eyeglasses is essential for keeping your eyes protected against the elements.

[on her relationship with Bruce Willis]

I love him; we live in the same house. We were together for 18 years. He's so cool and he looks like he's on his way up. But it's true that there are times when he gets a little over-the-top, and you wish he would stop doing stuff. Like if he was going to go out, he'd be careful not to get into any trouble. Also he has a temper. He yells at me sometimes. In fact, I've called him ""f**kface"" several times in my life.

What amazes me about Bruce Willis is how he can be such an incredible person and still end up being this guy who says things that make you want to punch someone. I mean, what do you do?


[on a character she played in the film 'The Rock'] My role as this woman who had been kidnapped by the bad guys, and who turned into a super hero, was great fun - especially because it was one of those movies where everybody knows each other. It had all these people from different parts of town, all dressed alike, and I had no idea why they were all dressed the way they were. And then they said, ""Hey, man, we got the girl back.""","Yes, that's right.

Q: what is the purpose of this?

A: This was a one-way mirror so we could do two-way mirrors, so you can see through the glass and you don't have to use both hands in order to get close. So it gives us something like two-dimensional vision on your computer screen. It also allows you to look at the side of your eyes when you're not using the glasses or if your goggles are too heavy for you. The whole thing is very comfortable and easy to put on.

Q: What type of glasses are used?

A: We use the Clearview brand, which is the most popular brand out there.

Q: do they fit my face comfortably?

A: They can fit you perfectly. They have a nice shape and feel good because they're made from natural materials like cotton and polyester. They're lightweight and flexible, and as long as you wear them correctly, they'll keep you cool even when your body temperature changes.","Yes. The standard and most common type of glasses are called ""HPD"" (High-Performing Double Refractive Dye) or ""TFT"" (Transmissive Glasses). These are available in a wide variety of colors, and provide a superior optical quality to regular prescription lenses. Many people find the TFT style of glasses better than standard prescription eyewear because they have more contrast between their eyes when viewed from different angles. In addition, HPD and TFT can be customized with custom frames that enhance your vision.The best way to ensure you get the best quality glasses is to go to an optician who specializes in eyeglasses, especially if it's not possible to get them at any other location near you. For example, if you live in California, ask if there are any places in San Diego where you can get the high performance lenses made by Foveon. There are also specialty opticians all over the country offering a good selection of high end, super durable, and stylish sunglasses. You may even need to visit a second professional before you make the purchase - but don't worry, these professionals will treat you as a family member and take care of you as though you were one of their own!","Yes. We are the only place in the world where you can find a complete set of them on our website.

Q: I have lost my glasses, how do I get them back?A: If you need to return your glasses you must call us at 0800 726 9052 (Monday-Friday 8am – 4pm) or email us with the details of your glasses and we will be happy to assist you.","yes

Q: Is it a requirement to use the word ""Windows"" as opposed to the word ""Operating System""?

Answer: No. The term Windows is used by OEMs, and we recommend that you do not refer to any other operating system. If you are referring to a specific OS version, such as Windows 7, or an older OS version, then ""XP"" is fine as well.

There are also situations where you may want to avoid using certain words on the product name or box in order to make your work more clear and concise. For example, ""Win 7,"" would be confusing for some consumers when they see this type of language. Similarly, ""Microsoft Word 2003"" could be confusing for customers who have never heard of Microsoft Office before!

If you really need to use the word ""Windows"" because of technical considerations (for example, the fact that Windows is often installed on CD-ROMs) the following guidelines should help:

Use the words ""operating system"" instead of ""system."" Use a capitalized abbreviation of ""OS"" such as ""Windows"" or ""Microsoft Windows"" instead of the standard abbreviations such as ""MS-DOS"" or ""WINDOWS""

Use the word ""Windows"" and/or ""Windows XP""

You can try the following strategies if you're having trouble with these instructions:

Try creating a new word that is shorter and easier to read. Try creating a shortened form of your existing product's name. Start a new site called YourNameWebsites.com. Paste your product page into the site and select ""Go To Product Page."" Check out the results and add your link here. Now you'll get regular email updates on how the products look and behave.

It will take time for you to learn all of the nuances of using this technology, but once you've done so, you'll be ready to go when things change.

Good luck with your new web site!","You don't have to wear eyeglasses when you play games. They can help, but they aren't necessary if the screen is in good working order.","Yes. You can use glasses without eyeglasses.

If you have the time, it's good to bring a magnifier with your eyesight. If you don't, then be aware that the magnification is small (or not very much at all).

Do you want to try out VR or AR? It's important to get used to virtual reality and augmented reality. For example, if you're playing an MMORPG on your PC, you may find that everything looks really familiar, but when you look down from above, you notice something new. This can be quite fun, especially as you are learning how things work in games. When we are talking about AR, it doesn't always mean that it will look like real life. To see what it means, check out this video by Dr. Paul Purnell, who has studied a variety of different AR technologies.","No, I do not.I have a set of regular glasses that does not fit my eyes well and would only be worn by people who don't like glasses and/or are very tall.

130,Question: neck and shoulder stretches\nAnswer:,"Stretch your upper back by extending the spine. If you can't reach the end, just continue to stretch the front of the body in the same way as the previous exercise.

Tennis Spinning Backward

Lie on your side with a pillow under your left arm. Place your hands behind your head so that they are on your thighs or knees. Start spinning around with your arms overhead until you feel like you're pulling yourself up. Keep your arms straight until you get to a point where you have lifted your legs off the floor. Then lower them down for 10-12 times. Repeat 3 times.

The first time I tried this exercise it didn't really work very well. The muscles didn't move very much at all because my shoulders were still pretty wide open. After some practice I found out that I had to use more of a downward motion than I was used to doing to get the most benefit from the exercise. For example, if the ball is rolled forward slightly then make sure to roll your hips outward rather than pushing hard with your elbows.

Spinal Twist

Stand upright with a foam roller under one shoulder and your other hand under your right knee. Lift your right leg up, keeping your heel flat against the surface of the ground. Now slowly bend over at the waist, bending the knee about 20 degrees. Hold this position for 1 second, then release and repeat 10 times.


Spinners


As you may be able to guess, these exercises aren't the easiest to do. But they don't require any special equipment (and should only take 15 minutes). To start off with, try doing each exercise for 20 seconds, then stop when you start feeling tired. Once you've done 30 reps, cut it short and go right into another set of 12 repetitions. It's also helpful to spend 2-3 sessions working each muscle group separately before trying to combine the workout. You'll probably find that you can't complete them at once so there must be a proper timing for each exercise.

Stretching Before & After Workouts

During workouts you will want to take care not to strain your muscles too badly by stretching after your workout. Here are a few tips to help you keep things nice and healthy during your workouts:

Keep your feet elevated when you're walking around on the treadmill. This will prevent you from running into obstacles.

Avoid wearing shorts/pants with elastic bands wrapped around the ankles. These may cause serious damage.

Use","Yes. You can go into the studio with a neck stretch and do some arm stretches to work on your shoulders. For example, if you're feeling tired from working in front of a computer all day and want to get those muscles stronger, try doing these exercises:

• Stretch your neck using one hand while holding a towel; this will increase blood flow through it (you can also hold an elastic band instead). This exercise can be done several times per week without any additional equipment.


• Use the following body weight exercise for your upper back. Hold a pillow between your elbows and lower back. Now lie on your side with the knees bent and pull yourself up with the arms. This is another way to strengthen your upper back as well.

What's The Bottom Line?

Whether you are trying to improve flexibility or lose fat, there is plenty of information about how to do both things at once. And just like with anything you do, having the right tools helps make every exercise easier and more effective. If your goal is to develop strength, you need a good stretching program that will allow you to do the basic movements and then progress towards specific training. With proper form and technique, you'll be able to perform these exercises properly. If your goal is to get a big waistline, you must use high quality nutrition and healthy lifestyle habits to help you get lean.","if you have trouble with your shoulders, try these out first :-*3x10 sec walk at a pace that will help you maintain tension in your back, arms, neck. For the front part of the body - do 3 sets of 10 repetitions (counting off). Also work up to using more weight for each exercise. The exercises are listed below :-* Back stretch :- hold 30 seconds on the back as you begin to sit down; repeat 8 times.* Forearm Stretch :- hold 15 seconds on both sides or alternately (one side) and then alternate with the opposite hand. Repeat 6 times.* Knees :- hold 20 seconds on each side or alternately (one side) and then alternate with the opposite hand. Repeat 4 times.* Hip flexors :- hold 5 seconds on either side. Alternate hands alternating hands and feet. Repeat 3 times. * You can also perform this exercise while sitting down, but be careful not to cause pain in the legs!


Backward Headstand Stretch(s):

This is an easy and effective way to keep those hips back during the forward headstand. This stretch can be done with one arm only, so use it when working on strengthening your abs. Note: there may be some risk of injury in doing this stretch with heavy weights.


Step 1: Lay on the ground. Place your right leg over the left leg and bend your knees slightly. Step away from the wall and lift yourself slowly to the top position. Keep your chest high and your lower back tight.


Step 2: Keeping the arms straight, bend forward and extend your torso towards the ceiling. Your goal is to create a slight arch in your spine. Once you get to the desired height, pull yourself to the floor by rotating your torso 90 degrees. As you rotate, push your right foot back into your body. Use your core muscles to stabilize yourself until your upper body returns to the starting position. Make sure to rest your back against something hard (wood, table or other support).


Step 3: Slowly return to the beginning position. Be careful not to let your back bend too far past its original spot. You should feel the pressure of your shoulders come back into alignment. If they don't, then you need to find something harder to roll back onto and start again. In order to ensure proper posture for the next step, keep your face up. It's easier to control if your forehead touches the floor.","Try to find something that allows you to stretch your neck and shoulders. There are many different kinds of neck stretching exercises on the internet, but if you can't afford or want a real one then try these ones. They should be very easy for any beginner! This will give you a feeling of balance in all parts of the body: back, head, arms, legs etc. It's also good as an after-workout warm up.

2.) Back, Shoulder and Head Stretch\nYou may have noticed it is not always recommended to do this exercise while lying down or with arm stretched out above head (like we did when doing the neck stretch). While lying down there is no problem because it doesn't really affect your spine – even though you would prefer that it does. However you don't want to do this exercise while trying to push off from the floor or from sitting on your feet either. If this is your case then use the following alternative: Lie on your back with both hands flat on the floor. Keep your chin resting in between your hand and the floor. Put your fingers under your armpits and pull them upwards until they touch your belly button. This will help to stretch your neck muscles. If you have trouble getting your arms up high enough then place them underneath your torso and hold them just below your midpoint of chest. You might notice that some of my friends say that it feels more comfortable with their back side facing forwards than the other way around. That's what I was talking about earlier. Now put your palms together and rotate them towards your ear so that your index finger touches your hairline. Now slowly lean forward and twist your head to one side. At first you may think you're going crazy but as long as you continue doing it over time you'll feel less tense at the end of each set. The key here is not to let your arms fall behind you during the twists, but simply stay relaxed and let your jaw drop a bit while rotating to one side.

3.) Neck Flexor Stretch\nThis is another exercise which helps to strengthen the neck. Start by laying face down on your back with your head close to the wall. Place a pillow beneath your nose, spread your fingers wide and grab the edge of it with your right hand. Pull yourself up into a straight line with your left hand and then slowly lower yourself back down. It may take a few tries before you get used to it. To start this exercise make sure you've got a towel hanging on your","back, legs, and feet

2. Shoulder Press/Pull-Ups

1) One arm lat pulldown (10 to 15 reps), one arm dumbbell row (15 to 20 reps), or one leg chinup (20 to 25 reps). All three of these movements should be done in a staggered fashion as shown in Figure 1-3. For all three exercises, keep your grip tight throughout the entire set.

Figure 1-3 – Staggering movement for shoulder press and pull-ups

2) Rows with dumbbells (60 seconds, 60 repetitions). A full range of motion is required to complete this exercise. It's recommended that you do the first 10 reps slowly and then increase volume over time. The second few sets are not required.

3) Dumbbell overhead presses (30 seconds, 30 repetitions)

4) Calf raises (30 seconds, 30 repetitions)

5) Leg curls (50 seconds, 50 repetitions)

6) Cable flyes (25 seconds, 25 repetitions)


NOTE: This schedule will allow you ample recovery between workouts so it can help build muscle mass and strength for bodybuilding competitions. If you have any questions about the specific moves, feel free to ask them below!

(Photos courtesy of Doreen Boudreau)","you can stretch all the muscles in the body, but if your shoulders are tight or your back is weak (like when you're working out), this would be a good time to do a couple of sets of these stretches.

If You Have A Big Back, Stretch Your Shoulders First

You don't have to go all the way down and squeeze everything that moves. Some people will just feel their spine ""tugging"" on the floor, and it's fine for them because they only had one muscle. If your spine has problems moving, maybe just doing some light stretching helps. Just start with 30 seconds on each side and work up from there. I recommend getting out of your chair and stretching in front of the mirror so you can see how much space you have to move through. Start out by bending forward at the waist. Bend your knees, take your arms behind your head, push off the ground with your lower legs (as shown) and then slide down until your feet hit the floor, pressing hard against the floor. Do 1-3 reps for your upper back and 5-10 for your lower back, taking care not to hyperextend the knee joint. Take care not to hurt yourself while doing this, as the stretch is fairly easy to do. Repeat 10 times. This stretch works both the mid-back and the lumbar region. Once you've done this, try standing up without your hands holding anything or with your elbows in front of you and pushing yourself into the wall. Again, do 2-5 reps per arm, using the same exercise order.

Do 3 Sets For The Arms And 4 For The Legs

This stretch works primarily in the traps, chest, and triceps. To perform it: Stand facing a wall with your arms straight overhead, and slowly raise your palms toward the ceiling, palms facing away from you. Now, turn around and hold with your thumbs facing towards your torso, palms facing inward. Pause for a second, then rotate your torso 180 degrees, squeezing your abs together and pushing the arms out as far as possible. Keep your arms still and repeat for 5-8 repetitions. This stretch also works the bicep, elbow flexors, and latissimus dorsi (lats). For the legs, do the opposite exercise, but bend your ankles so the knees stay bent even when lowering. Press down, pulling on the toes like you're going to do squats, while raising the knees until your feet touch the floor. Hold","You can start with just a few things, but if you want to build up your flexibility then do more.

If you are doing stretchy exercises such as lunges or twists on the arms then it is important not to use anything that will strain or injure your shoulders. If you have any concerns about this, ask your instructor or a physio for advice. This is not meant to be an excuse not to work out. It's meant to encourage you to get into the habit of stretching every day.

Question: what does it feel like after you have done some yoga? Answer: The sensations you experience may vary based on how much you have stretched and how well you did at keeping yourself loose. As usual, do whatever feels good!

Question: How often should I practice yoga? Answer: Yoga is best practiced twice a week. Some people find that they need less exercise than this so they can do it three times a week instead. But most people feel comfortable working their way through all the poses in this sequence at least once. So take advantage of it and don't miss it!

Question: What kind of stretches are recommended by various teachers/practitioners? Answer: They vary from person to person. You might hear something like ""don't overdo it"" or ""take it easy"". These statements would apply very differently if someone told you you had to perform a hundred push ups before sitting down for a whole hour (or something similar) while other people say ""I don't mind when you have your hands in the air for a minute or two."" It depends on your experience level; if you enjoy yoga and like to stretch it regularly, chances are you will be able to figure out your own body language and tell where everyone else is trying too hard or making mistakes. On the other hand, if you prefer to keep things simple and stick to one thing each time, and can manage to complete all the steps within twenty minutes without any effort, then there may still be room for improvement. Try different stretches first in order to see which ones feel good and which ones don't. Try them until they become second nature to you. When you feel comfortable with it, try another. Don't let your ego get in the way. There are no wrong choices here – just try new ones.

Some tips for finding good teachers

When searching for teachers who teach yoga, try to avoid instructors that come directly from a studio or college. That will only make it harder to learn from them,","Yes, use a yoga belt!

""There are many different types of shoulder poses. For example, you could do the traditional shoulder stretch with your back straight, or you can do a frontward bend to strengthen and lengthen your shoulders."" -Dr. John F. Coyle, MD

This is an easy stretching exercise that can help get your back in shape while improving your posture (or even relieve some aches!). You'll need to do it at least 3-4 times each week for about 6 weeks. If it's not working for you, try doing a few of these exercises on one arm, and then switch arms. Do this every day until you feel like your back is completely healthy again. As long as you're getting regular work done and you don't stop, we know that your back will look amazing!

Another common question people have about the back stretch works is whether there is anything special you should be doing before starting this routine? Well, when I started practicing yoga 2 years ago, I couldn't find a single ""back stretch"" video on Youtube, so I decided to create my own. After watching many videos, I discovered that this was actually pretty much all there was – no fancy postures or gimmicks here. My goal was simply to focus on how to get the most benefit from the basic pose, without trying too hard to make it seem more advanced than it really is.

So that's why my version of the back stretch works best if you just stick to performing it correctly. Remember, once you've mastered the exercise properly, you can try other variations such as pushing your shoulders forward, bending your knees, raising your head and elbows towards your chest, etc., but remember that it's very important that you stay true to the original movement patterns. That means never overdoing it, and making","1. Start with your feet together, then bend the legs slightly to bring them over the toes. Then bring the hips back up slightly so you're standing on your heels.

2. If that's not possible, get into a squat position in which you can sit on the floor comfortably (or in a chair). Don't just do this one stretch; do it three times and add more repetitions if needed.

3. Rest for 10 minutes. Repeat two-three times.","stretch your lower back to the floor (right side). You will notice that you can feel a slight stretching in your lumbar spine. It is important not to allow this to happen because it will make the stretch much worse than if done correctly.

Question: Shoulder and collar stretches, what should I do? Answer: This is also an excellent question, but you need to know exactly how long to do each stretch so that you are not putting yourself at risk of injury. The answer depends on the person who asks the question. If you have poor mobility, a single or double extension stretch may be adequate. With more advanced bodybuilders, there may be times when you want to get into full range, such as with a lateral raise (e.g., bench press), and this would require multiple sets. For people without good flexibility, either one or two exercises will suffice. Do not overdo the movement. This will limit your training potential by making you weak. In addition, many people find that the longer they hold out for their muscle contraction, the harder the exercise becomes. Thus, the longer you hold out, the more your muscles grow in size and strength. Your best bet is to do all four exercises for 2-4 minutes each. These exercises work all the major muscle groups, including the upper back, thoracic spinal column, shoulder, chest, lats, shoulders, triceps, calves, and glutes.

Question: Shoulders and neck stretch\nAnswer: There are several different ways to go about doing these stretches. One way is to simply lay on your left side, and pull your right arm behind your back (or put your left hand behind your head) while using your legs to keep up. Another way is to use a chair, where you place your hands on both sides, and then just lift your torso off the ground. Still another way is to push your legs against a wall or hard surface to create tension from your arms. Some people choose to do these stretches on their own, others prefer to watch a video on YouTube, and still others will do them while working on their physique. Be sure to practice enough before trying anything.

Question: Shoulder and wrist stretches, which ones do I use? Answer: Since most people tend to stick their fingers down while bending your elbows, the last thing you'd want to do is stretch your wrists. However, since our bodies can extend and contract at any angle we wish, the next best move is the reverse wrist flex"
131,Question: exercises for better posture\nAnswer:,"The best way to improve your posture is to do simple exercises.


What are you doing in your chair? Do you need to stand up on the floor to get an idea of how much exercise you're getting from sitting down? A few minutes a day, if you can manage it, will make a big difference. You can add a couple of blocks and work from there, but keep the goal in mind.


For example, some people sit at the end of a long day at the office when they could be at home or playing with their kids, and this causes them to have to stretch out their muscles. In order to reduce strain on these muscle groups (and therefore increase flexibility), we recommend standing while walking at first. If you walk slowly enough for at least 20-30 seconds every minute, you should start seeing improvements immediately.


If you're having trouble keeping your balance while walking, try stretching with the leg slightly bent as seen below. It's important that you don't take too long to stretch; if you move too quickly you may cause back pain!","1) stretch your back and shoulders when you start doing exercises. 2) make sure to do some exercise where the weight is on top of you, such as situps or push-ups. 3) put a belt on so that the arms are under it (the more the merrier). 4) if there's no belt in front, then either tie a knot in the waistband before, or use a bandana around your neck. 5) don't try to lift weights! 6) be careful not to bend forward while doing exercises, because this will cause stress on your spine. 7) keep your head up by being tall at all times. 8) when exercising, make sure you are breathing evenly and keep your heart rate up and you're using proper form. 9) remember, you need to maintain good balance between both feet. 10) do these exercises with a partner or yourself, but please have someone to help you out if necessary.

Question: What is the difference between a yoga and meditation practice? Answer: meditation, which involves breathing, moving through space, and focusing on feelings in order to overcome stress and anxiety, has been described as an exercise that helps us develop certain mental skills. Yoga is similar but does not require any particular technique or form of movement. It is more of a way of being with the body rather than as a separate activity. You can do it in bed or while you are waiting for the bus or walking around on a sunny day. The main thing is that you pay attention and be aware of what's happening inside.

Question: how can I get started? Answer: Start by doing some simple poses with your partner. These are called postures of the torso (pranayama) and head (viparita). They will help improve your posture and work on balancing yourself. Then try out different positions: lying down or sitting up; standing, kneeling, standing with one leg bent at the knee, sitting on a chair or floor, lying on your back or on your side. This exercise gives you an opportunity to work on balance and flexibility. Also try practicing walking backward from your starting point instead of forward. Practice it gradually and slowly until you feel comfortable. If there are many people working together, you may need several sessions before you can see a noticeable improvement. Don't go overboard though! Try to focus only on a few poses each time so you don't become bored after just a few minutes. Remember that all kinds of postural adjustments are possible depending on your individual needs.","If your hips are too far apart and your knees are higher than your toes, you can help relieve that by standing on the balls of your feet. This is a great exercise to do during meditation or yoga classes.

Other possible solutions include using a ball to support your shoulders; leaning forward with your arms at your side or behind you; holding your hands in front of you and your palms facing each other; sitting cross-legged, with one foot more than the other; keeping one arm straight and the other hand on top of it; sitting up from an old position (this may be difficult if your lower back is tight) or taking steps and walking down stairs.

To prevent pressure points:

If you have pinched muscles (such as your shoulder blades), you may need to adjust the angle of your pelvis and/or the angle of your neck so that they lie close together. The best way to do this is to practice stretching out the range of motion by simply bending at the waist slightly, then relaxing before doing it again.

You may also notice that your elbows will naturally fall closer together while you try to reach your upper arm above your head. You will probably find that when trying to stretch your torso into a ""V"" shape you find that you must bend your elbow in order to reach your upper arm, even though it isn't really necessary. Also, try placing a cushion under your chin in order to make your gaze point directly downwards.

The most important thing here is not to get frustrated and start thinking of ways to fix your problem without actually knowing how to solve it. Achieving a good posture is something that takes time. It's about getting used to the idea of what makes us look like we're comfortable, which means being flexible enough to change your own posture whenever necessary.","if you have problems with your back or hip, exercise a plank.

#2: Stand up straight without bending at the waist

#3: Extend your arms overhead to balance yourself

#4: Squat down as low as possible so that you can control the weight of your body and not get caught on something in the air

#5: Keep your legs straight (legs are more important than feet)

#6: Hold your breath until your whole body is relaxed, then exhale

#7: Lift your torso off the ground, keeping it close to your chest and hips while lifting your torso up, keeping your neck tight

#8: Bend your knees slightly but do not allow them to bend further than 90 degrees from vertical

#9: Do not let your core sag

How long to rest between sets?

You may want to vary this workout depending on how sore you are after a hard session and whether you feel like resting for longer periods of time, such as during competition. Also, take note of how much you are able to bench press per set and what number of reps you managed to complete each rep.

The last thing you should be aware of is the fact that the more muscular you are (especially if you're a guy), the shorter these workouts will take to finish! If you want to improve muscle size (i.e., gain strength) you need to train heavy, often multiple times per week! You'll also notice that many of the muscles mentioned above are very versatile, meaning they can be trained both in the gym and in isolation as well. For example, the hamstrings would be great to train before squatting, or simply working your glutes on deadlifts. The most popular single-muscle movement for building mass would be the leg curl. To increase your flexibility, you could include some form of ankle mobility work, such as some calf stretch training. It's really up to you!

Remember, don't do too many repetitions per set; just try and make sure you achieve at least one set of 10 reps. Also remember that it doesn't matter if you lift 2-3 times per week, as long as you continue performing regular cardio and/or lifting weights frequently enough to keep the pump going.

Next, you'll need to move the puck across the ice. This is where you will try different angles on the blade of the stick and also make sure to get in good position between the circles of the boards. Don't overdo anything in this step! The goal is to be able to make a quick move without having a lot of time taken up by waiting until a pass comes in or being caught off guard. Just keep moving forward, and hopefully, the puck goes through one circle into another. Keep doing this until you can just barely see the center of the net. If that happens, take some time to adjust yourself because you are still not properly aligned at all times.

After that, it's time to work on getting in front of the goalie. First, put as much weight behind the stick as possible; this way, you won't tip the stick off balance when you move from side to side. Next, hold your stick straight out and in front of you while you practice putting pressure on your opponent's back hand. Try to maintain constant pressure throughout the entire length of the rink. As long as you stay centered and keeping solid contact, you should eventually succeed. Once you're comfortable with this part, it's time to begin working on your positioning around the blue line. You'll want to place more emphasis on making sure your stick is facing the right direction so that you don't cut off passing lanes. Once you've got these two things worked out, it's time to work on finding other areas of the ice to attack. One thing I learned during my time playing in Europe was that trying to find an area to sneak through is often counterproductive—it leads you away from your objective and gives a false sense of security. Instead, focus on attacking the puck itself (which is usually easier), then looking for gaps in defense.","if you can't stand straight, then it's not your neck that's bent; your spine is. If a person has to bend his or her spine with extreme effort (like the one in the picture), it's unlikely that he or she will be able to get good posture.

Trouble breathing? Try this exercise and watch your breath relax as you do it.

If you find that you're still struggling, try the following four exercises:

1) Standing up slowly from your seated position

2) Keeping your back straight, stretch each side of your lower body apart as far apart as possible without bringing them close together

3) Keep both feet on the floor

4) Lie down with both legs crossed on top of your head

5) Slowly pull down your chin until you can't see through your upper teeth anymore

6) Do these in rapid succession at about 10 repetitions per side. Repeat as many times as needed until you feel that they are working.

7) Sit down on the ground with only the base leg raised off the ground. Your hand should be supporting you on the underside of your thigh (not your hip). With your right foot on the floor, lift your left leg, keeping your pelvis firmly pressed against the floor. Lift your heel out toward the ceiling so that your knee stays straight while you raise your other leg off the ground. Pull your upper arm back and out from under your armpit to keep it parallel to the floor. Hold this position for as long as necessary, then slowly lower yourself back into the sitting position. Make sure to hold your balance for a moment before you let go of your weight. You might need to rest for several seconds between each repetition of each set.","I do not know. There are a lot of different things that can improve your posture, and I have seen some people get better in their posture while doing this exercise.

Q: How many repetitions should I do?

A: The more reps you do on each side the faster you will progress. Just follow the chart below to determine how many times per set you need to perform the exercises shown on the chart.


The chart below shows how many sets you will need when performing certain exercises. You should be able to achieve at least 2-3 sets of these exercises with a regular training routine. The chart above shows how many sets you will need when performing certain exercises. You should be able to achieve at least 2-3 sets of these exercises with a regular training routine.

Please note: when performing a set of the exercises listed on this page, use only 1 hand! If using both hands, you may lose balance or make other errors during the movement (which is why it's so important to keep them as straight as possible).

If you'd like to see our complete guide on how to do exercises properly, click here","when you exercise your back, it makes the muscles tighten and strengthen. When they are strong enough to move with a normal spine, the weight of the body is placed on them instead of moving the limbs.

In other words, the arms become heavier as well because their movements have been strengthened and improved from years of sitting at work. In most cases, this improves your overall strength so that you can lift more. The key to making these changes in posture is getting good balance between the shoulder blades and chest; this has to be balanced and controlled by stretching and strengthening all areas of the upper body (arms, shoulders, neck, etc). While doing these things you will be able to achieve results quicker than if you just sit there. If you do not get good alignment between the shoulder blades and the chest, the movement becomes ineffective and causes back pain. These techniques can also be used while walking or running.","I like to lie down with my back straight, head up and eyes open. When you are sleeping on a pillow or in bed, this is not a bad idea as well. You can also try sitting at your desk or on the couch. If you have trouble getting comfortable, place one foot against the floor. Then move it until your body feels good. As long as your spine stays healthy, all else will work out just fine.

Other tips: Try to keep all of your joints loose so that they can't hurt when you bend over (this goes for most people). Use a brace on your knee if possible; don't wear anything too tight around your neck. Don't sit on pillows or furniture; use your knees instead. The whole goal is to relax your shoulders and make them look more relaxed while stretching. Make sure you get enough sleep before doing any exercise. It's better to go to bed early than to be awake late!

If you do choose to take part in an exercise class, remember that doing it on your own will probably be much easier and you'll see results faster.

Also, take care of your breathing: always breathe deeply through your nose by closing your mouth and taking a few deep breaths out the nose. And don't force your chest forward because that means you're working for maximum oxygen flow to your brain. So keep your head back and keep your chin held high. A little bit of breathing doesn't hurt either. Just focus on how your breath feels. If you feel like you need more air, simply inhale slowly and hold that position for a second.

The main thing about exercising? Resting between sets. That way you'll know how hard you worked and whether you actually got better. So if you went from 30 minutes to 2 hours, take a day off before you start again. This would mean resting between every 10 sets of each workout – or 4-6 weeks if you're using a heavy resistance band.

Once you decide what kind of program works best for you, find a strength coach who specializes in yoga and fitness. He/she might even be able to give you a personal recommendation for one of the programs. But don't worry: many coaches are quite enthusiastic about their students' progress, and they'll help you figure out which method works best for you."
132,Question: headpats scalp psoriasis\nAnswer:,"If you have severe psoriasis, then your scalp is not going to be able to tolerate a towel.

How do I take care of my hair?

Do not use shampooing products that contain alcohol. Alcohol can cause rashes and burns on the skin. Using shampoo without alcohol will also irritate your scalp or leave it dry. A good alternative for washing your hair would be using shampoo with natural ingredients such as tea tree oil (such as Jojoba). However, if using soap or shampoo containing alcohol is necessary for your health reasons, please consult your doctor before using any products.

When should I wash my hair?

Hair must be washed when there are no signs of infection (for example, if it has been in contact with an infected wound) or irritation from the shampoo. If there are signs of infection, it's important to rinse immediately. Once again, once the condition has healed, it's best to go ahead with a fresh treatment plan.

What kind of shampoo should I use?

Before using any shampoo, talk to your dermatologist about whether there are specific conditions that require a particular type of shampoo. Some ingredients include glycerin which contains fragrance, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mineral oil. These can interfere with each other's effectiveness. Additionally, some types of detergents may have chemicals in them that may cause damage to your hair. The safest options for shampooing are those that are made with just one ingredient and contain only what is needed for your needs.

Should I shampoo while wearing my makeup?

Yes, you should always shower after taking your make-up application off. Shampooing at this time allows moisture to penetrate into the hair. It also helps keep your pores open so that toxins don't enter your system. While shampooing is recommended every few days, you can use more frequent shampoos if you prefer.

Can I drink coffee while shaving?

A small amount of caffeine can help relieve stress caused by the shaving process. However, this shouldn't result in a hangover, nor does drinking coffee during shaving.

I shaved my entire body. Does this mean I'm ready to go bald?

Unfortunately, we're unable to offer advice on how to deal with your own hair loss. You need to seek professional consultation from a dermatologist who specializes in treating hair loss.","No, the skin is sensitive and you can develop other types of skin problems. The most common symptoms are itching (not just on your hands) and redness in the palms.

If you have eczema, this may be accompanied by a rash that looks like rashes or blisters. This type of dermatitis also gets worse if you don't wash your face frequently as it's not normal for someone with eczema to get rid of their own scabs! It may also be associated with an allergy to hair products such as hairspray, shampoo etc.


There is no way to know what causes hair loss due to hair follicles dying, but there have been reports that people who use too much or long-term hair removal products also suffer from hair loss.

How to treat hair loss from your scalp?

In general, topical treatments can help reduce the pain caused by hair loss from your scalp. They do include creams and lotions which contain antihistamines, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen or aspirin, which help stop the release of histamine into your body. These products should only be used for short periods of time because they can cause dry patches that tend to last longer than 1 week. If your hair is very thin, especially on your head, it might need treatment more often depending on the severity of the hair loss.

Hair therapy works best when you choose a salon and the right therapist. You'll probably want to work closely with one who has experience in treating hair loss and knows how to manage the different aspects of hair growth. Many therapists will prescribe a variety of prescription hair treatments based on your needs and lifestyle. You could find an affordable prescription cream, gel or spray that contains salicylic acid at a drugstore. In case the salon doesn't stock these products, they can be found online in specialised websites and even in some specialist shops.

Your doctor will usually suggest the type of therapy you need for your specific situation. A combination of oral corticosteroids, steroids and salicylic acid treatments are generally used to relieve chronic inflammation of the scalp. Dermatologists also recommend the use of medication such as isotretinoin and minocycline to treat acne and scleroderma (ringing between your eyes), although this is controversial since there aren't any approved drugs approved for those conditions yet. Your dermatologist will tell you what medications are available. Some people prefer to take daily meds through a pump","You may want to consider using a shampoo containing a mild cleansing agent such as sodium lauryl sulfate, but do not use anything that contains petroleum or other harsh ingredients. In the case of severe skin reactions such as dermatitis, try using one that contains aloe vera gel, vitamin E oil and/or vitamin C (at least twice a day).

Other options are natural oils like olive, castor and grapeseed and plant extracts like peppermint, dandelion root, ginger, lavender or lemon. You can also take a small amount of an emulsifier oil or humectant oil before your shower to help remove water spots after shampooing. A simple application of baking soda will sometimes alleviate irritation on the face. Be sure to massage it into the scalp to reduce irritation if it is too irritating for you.

If you have very dry hair, especially during winter, it is best to avoid using lotions containing mineral oil or alcohol. If you do choose to make these products, be careful about how much and what types of ingredients they contain. Mineral oil has been linked to sensitivity in some people. The same applies to alcohol. Make sure all products you use are safe for sensitive skin and that they don't irritate or change the color of your hair.","No, you are not making a statement that there is no link between your hair and your disease.

Q: What should I do if my hair is just dying from the stress of not shaving?

A: When your hair starts falling out of control from being in hot weather or being stressed because you're working all night, first things first should be taking care of the problem with shampooing. You can use any kind of shampoo that is safe for your scalp (I recommend a very good conditioner). Apply the shampoo before bed and after washing your hair. Don't shower and shave as well as when you get home. Remember, no one is going to take care of you during the day so make sure you do everything possible to maintain your hair.

Q: How often should I apply moisturizer?

A: Use a non-greasy moisturizer that has at least 6% oatmeal in it (you could also try a high quality cleanser but it doesn't help much)

Q: Is there anything else you'd like me to tell you?

A: Yes, definitely! Please let me know what worked for you and feel free to ask questions that aren't covered here in comments! Thank you again for reading!","Yes, in some people.

Q: What causes hair loss? Answer: Hair follicles are dying. This means they're dying from the inside out because of an infection or other conditions. Your hair cells are being attacked by microscopic organisms called keratinocytes. These keratinocytes, known as melanocytes, produce a substance called eosinophil protein that allows hair to grow back. When you remove your hair and put it into another person's hands, there is nothing preventing them from using this new hair tissue to replace their own. So, your hair grows back! If you have no hairs left on your body (a condition called alopecia), this process may be irreversible (that is, permanent). In addition, the growth of hair does not occur evenly across your entire scalp - it can vary between different areas of the scalp. For instance, if you have very thin hair (less than 5 millimeters) at one side of your head, it will spread over much larger areas and take up even more space. And when you go bald, you will lose that hair shaft.

So how do we know whether a change in our hair color has something to do with a problem with your health? There are several factors that might contribute to a change in your skin tone. The most important factor is sun exposure. It seems obvious to us now, but when you were young you probably had intense amounts of sunlight on your face all day every day for years before you started getting sick. Sunlight penetrates deep into the skin and creates pigmentation changes throughout your body. Since your skin contains melanocytes, this pigment is produced and stored in your cells. Over time, the light intensity makes these melanocyte cells turn white while the darker ones become brown or gray. One study suggests that sun exposure increases the risk of developing blackheads and pimples on the forehead, temples and chin. Other studies suggest tanning beds are bad for your skin since they expose you to more ultraviolet light. The combination of UV radiation and tanning beds can increase the amount of vitamin D in your bloodstream and decrease your ability to make vitamin E. Vitamin E helps prevent macular degeneration. Some researchers speculate that vitamin E supplements can cause acne because they may block the absorption of vitamin A and folate from food sources like fruits, vegetables and meat. Some scientists say the increased use of sunscreen may also play a role in certain types of dark spots forming on your face and neck.

There are many other reasons why you might get sick","It's probably not the hair. I've seen many people who have long, curly and straight hair with no obvious problems and never show up to their doctor for a visit, which is always a red flag that they're not properly washing or shaving. That doesn't mean the hair isn't bad. What it does suggest is a lack of hygiene. The majority of cases are from those who don't wash at all, so that can be an issue. However, if you see a person in your office with thick hair that looks like it hasn't been washed recently (and also has no visible signs of infection), but has clean skin, then it might just be a case of over-washing. For more information about hair loss, check out this article.
What do the numbers on my head look like? Answer: How much skin you actually lose is entirely dependent on how much hair you have. This chart shows what percentage of your body is covered by baldness, according to a study done by Drs. John Baskin and Robert J. Lacy of the University of Southern California. It should give you a decent idea as to where you stand in terms of balding. If you have less than 4% to start with, the number will go down as you get closer to 5%. If you have more than 6%, you'll definitely need help. If you have 9% or more, you may want to consider getting some help. Some experts recommend getting facial treatments, like laser hair removal, which is far safer and more effective than surgery.","Yes, it's a disease of the scalp. It is caused by an overactive immune system and hair follicles are vulnerable to infection from bacteria or fungi that live in the environment. This can lead to hair loss.


Head pampering/brushing may cause more skin irritation than the underlying problem. When you brush your head, some bacteria get into the hair follicle and this causes more infections. In addition, you need to wash the scalp every day, which also helps protect it from bacteria. You should also try not to shampoo your head too often because it might irritate the scalp and make it itch. The best way to prevent this is to use mild soap with a lather. After brushing or after washing the scalp, put on clean cotton gloves and let the hands dry before putting on fresh gloves. If you feel like you have a lot of excess oil on your forehead, massage a small amount of coconut oil under your eyes for 3 minutes to release oil. Also massage the oil on your face and neck.

Q: I have had severe psoriasis for years, but now I am seeing results. What's going on? Answer: Psoriasis (Psoriatic Arthritis) is a chronic inflammatory disorder caused by a combination of factors such as genetics, age, lifestyle, stress and disease severity. The symptoms include scaly patches of skin that look like brownish-black spots with red edges around them. These areas usually occur at night time and last throughout the day. They vary in color from dark brown to light yellow to deep purple. Psoriasis affects both men and women. Psoriasis is typically treated through medication and is reversible if treatment is started within two weeks of onset. However, psoriasis does require periodic visits to a doctor who specializes in psoriasis.


If you do not have psoriasis, then psoriasis is not a serious health concern, as long as you keep up the prescribed medications. Psoriasis treatments typically include topical creams, ointments, injections and surgical procedures. Some people choose to go without surgery altogether. See our Treatment Guide for details.


When looking for an effective treatment, talk to your doctor about the type of psoriasis and whether you suffer from active (lifetime) or subclinical (occurring most frequently during a certain period) diseases. Your doctor will be able","headpats scalp psoriasis.

A: Head pats are a common symptom of psoriasis, and they don't usually cause any problems at all in most cases. For others, however, headpats may indicate an allergy or sensitivity to the hair-care products being used. There are three main types of treatments for headpats: laser therapy (light-based), creams and ointments (such as antihistamines) and topical steroids.


What is a typical day look like? A: One of the symptoms of psoriasis is that it's painful when you're not shaving. The pain can be so intense that you need to use your hands every few minutes to minimize the effect on yourself. You might even have trouble wearing clothes without having to hold them up over your head. When we think about these kinds of discomfort, we probably imagine someone who has suffered from the disease for decades, sitting cross-legged in a chair with his face pressed firmly against the pillows. Unfortunately, many people do not experience this kind of discomfort at all—they simply complain of ""headpats"" sometimes after shaving. This isn't actually true; it's more likely that the psoriatic patient complains of headpats because he hasn't shaved enough recently. In such a case, his body has been spending time repairing damage caused by years of hair loss. However, some patients also suffer from milder complaints of headaches and stiffness during the day.

Q: How long does it take to heal? A: It depends entirely upon how much scar tissue is left in the skin. Most psoriatic patients recover completely within two months if treatment with one of the different types of creams and ointments is continued. Once the initial inflammatory process is gone, the healing process takes longer than usual. In fact, healing times often vary widely depending on the size of the area involved and whether it was shaved lightly or heavily. Some people will only need to see their dermatologist once and then never go back. Others, however, will continue for several weeks to months until the underlying causes of the inflammation begin to clear out. And still other patients experience no improvement at all once their dermatologist decides what type of treatment is needed. The best way to determine if there is any potential problem with your psoriasis is to have your doctor perform a physical exam. Ask him or her to make sure everything looks normal. If there are obvious changes in the appearance of the affected areas, you should talk","The problem with hair growth, particularly on the face or neck is that it does not stay in one place and thus can grow to larger sizes. This can make skin problems worse when you have a lot of them and they are growing out of control. It also may be a sign of more serious problems (e.g. melanoma). When this happens, treatment might need to be done in some parts of the body for a long time.

- What kind of medication do you use? - Answer: There is no standard medication used to treat facial hair growth (other than laser treatments) but most people use topical products containing salicylic acid. These include lotions, creams and gels such as Permethrin, Alka-Seltzer, Neutrogena Hair Gel, and many others. You will also want to read about using these for other kinds of hair conditions. You should try to avoid all over-the-counter medications that contain aspirin, because you may be taking too much at once.

- If I am allergic to something I can't get rid of... - Answer: Most drugs cause an allergic reaction, which is when your body reacts to the substance by making its own immune system do whatever it needs to do to attack the object causing the allergy. Anaphylactic reactions usually happen within minutes. So if you're going to use a medication, don't wait until it's too late before changing it. Remember, anything you eat that contains sugar is probably going to trigger an allergic reaction in someone so keep it away from foods that are high in sugar like candy, fruit juices, coffee, etc. Also remember that medications come into contact with skin, so do not rub any part of yourself near medicine!

- What are some common side effects of topical or oral medicine? - Answer: Common side effects are itching, redness and swelling after application, irritation to eyes and mouth, burning sensation in hands and feet, nausea and vomiting. Be careful of all medicines and only switch if needed. Some people find that certain types of medicines have an adverse effect on their acne. Make sure to check all directions prior to starting. In addition, some medicines cause allergic reactions if taken internally. That includes antibiotics. Read and follow the instructions carefully.

- Are there any alternative methods of treating facial hair? - Answer: Yes, there are several options available and each has benefits. However, remember that different methods work better depending on what sort of facial hair is involved and how often"
